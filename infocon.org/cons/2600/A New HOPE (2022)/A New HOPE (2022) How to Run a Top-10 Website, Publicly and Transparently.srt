1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,240
thank you

2
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,420
[Music]

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,540
well welcome ladies and gentlemen uh our

4
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,760
next session how to run a top 10 website

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,920
publicly and transparently Canal is

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,960
going to be our presenter and we've got

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
to make sure we stay on on target for

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,739
time frame because after this is keynote

9
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,800
in here so take it away

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
thank you

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
um my name is kanal my or user Lego KTM

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,300
and today we're going to talk about uh

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,280
Wikipedia if you couldn't guess what the

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,739
top 10 website was

15
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,420
um I hope all of you know what Wikipedia

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,900
is it's a it's a free encyclopedia

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,119
um the the main goal of this talk is to

18
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,880
discuss transparency and so each slide

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,979
has a QR code where you can find the

20
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,479
resources that are on that slide if

21
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,640
there's a dashboard a graph or a charge

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,259
or something like that I'm not sure

23
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,640
you'll be able to scan them here but at

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
the end there's a very big QR code with

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,880
links to with the slides

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,220
um so Wikipedia is an encyclopedia you

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,420
know the things that they used to like

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,060
print on dead trees

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,060
um and it's primarily edited by

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,880
volunteers and it's available under a

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,159
free Creative Commons license you can

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,320
take the content and reuse it and remix

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,899
it as long as you attribute it that it

34
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,700
came from Wikipedia

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
and the goal of Wikipedia is really to

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,220
compile the sum of all human knowledge

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,560
and that's a pretty daunting task you

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
know on the left that's a picture of

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,659
what is the remains of the Library of

40
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,479
Alexandria which at one point was you

41
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,920
know like the biggest collection of

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,098
human knowledge and it's a pretty

43
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
daunting task but a lot of people are

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,780
are working hard and are up to it and as

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,459
a side effect you know we really make

46
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,800
the internet not suck in my opinion

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
um but just to give us you know to give

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,700
an idea of the scale of of the prom is

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,280
that estimates by looking at topic areas

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
suggests that we're about five percent

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
done with collecting you know all of

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,280
human knowledge

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,319
and I think that you know whenever I go

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,940
on Wikipedia no matter what I look up

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,560
I'll find something and yet to think

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,760
there were only five percent there

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
really you know gives us gives an

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,819
estimate of the magnitude of the task

59
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,780
that's in front of us

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
so first I want to talk about how uh how

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
Wikipedia operates you know just

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,319
building the encyclopedia and we'll get

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,840
to the technical part afterwards and

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,120
transparency is is really core principle

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
of Wikipedia itself so this is the

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,560
article for Webb's first Deep Field as

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
it looked about a week ago it looks

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,940
actually much better now and it was the

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,620
first image taken by the James Webb

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,720
Space Telescope

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,580
um and and you can read the article it's

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,200
a nice article explains a picture of the

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,959
background but you can also in the in

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,400
the top right there's a little tab this

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,739
is view history and if you click on the

76
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,920
tab it'll show you the history of the of

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,599
the page and this is again the history

78
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,400
from a week ago

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,379
um but then you can go through and look

80
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,420
at each individual revision of why

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,980
people made the change and then you can

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,720
actually look at a diff of the changes

83
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,700
themselves and so this diff is someone

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,799
just adhering to the manual of style and

85
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,780
changing the numeral six to be spelled

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,860
out s-i-x

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,840
um and that's all great but it doesn't

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,780
really explain like how things happen or

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,640
why things happen and so there's another

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,099
tab that says talk and that's really

91
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,019
where all the discussions happen on

92
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,939
Wikipedia and each page has an

93
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,560
Associated talk page that you'll find

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
some of these discussions on and people

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,099
ask different questions they'll discuss

96
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,480
the validity of different sources

97
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
they'll see if something is phrased

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,560
properly or could be phrased better or

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,299
you know whether something is unclear or

100
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,280
jargony or could be better and this is

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,599
really you know the heart of the

102
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,159
collaborative Spirit of Wikipedia is

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
that if you're not sure of something

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
instead of making the edit you can just

105
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,940
discuss it with other people

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,520
and really the technical infrastructure

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,160
works the same way we adhere to these

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
same principles of collaboration

109
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,520
transparency and openness

110
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,139
so just at a glance Wikipedia is the

111
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,780
seventh most visited website and I got

112
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,520
that stat from Wikipedia so I don't know

113
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
if it's true

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
um it's maintained by a collaboration of

115
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,580
volunteers and staff members and all of

116
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,199
the source code is available under free

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
licenses the majority of it is under the

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,139
GPL copyleft license and and like I said

119
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,600
it's developed in a collaborative manner

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
that you can observe and what I'll what

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,359
I'll kind of walk through today

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
um but first a quick segue naming things

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
is a hard computer science problems and

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,440
wikipedians kind of suck at this so

125
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,840
the globe logo is Wikipedia the

126
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,580
encyclopedia what you're really familiar

127
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,820
with in the middle is Wikimedia you know

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,039
it's the Wikimedia movement is a social

129
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,900
movement designed to you know spread

130
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,880
free knowledge but it's also the name of

131
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,800
the non-profit organization that

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,600
maintains you know trademarks legal

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,220
status and runs the servers that's the

134
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,460
Wikimedia Foundation or wmf and just as

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,419
an analogy Wikimedia is to Mozilla as uh

136
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,460
Wikipedia is to Firefox so that's kind

137
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,340
of the relationship and then if you flip

138
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,259
media Wiki around or if you flip

139
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,240
Wikimedia around you'll get media Wiki

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,860
which someone thought was a brilliant

141
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,020
idea of how to name the wiki software

142
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,699
that Powers Wikipedia and hundreds of

143
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,680
other wikis around the internet

144
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,080
I may use them interchangeably this is

145
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,660
kind of what it is uh but hopefully

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,740
it'll make sense

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,479
so a brief technical history of where

148
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,460
Wikipedia came from and that's what the

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,979
Wikipedia homepage looked like roughly

150
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,120
in in November December 2001.

151
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,860
um so there was a.com company called

152
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,340
bonus and one of their side projects was

153
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,680
newpedia which was a encyclopa which was

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,780
you know a public encyclopedia but

155
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
everything had to be reviewed before it

156
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
could be published

157
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,419
um and it was very slow and so they

158
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,340
decided why don't we create this project

159
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,979
called Wikipedia where anyone can edit

160
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,660
and eventually once the articles are

161
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
good enough quality we'll move them over

162
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,780
to newpedia

163
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,060
and about like you know a few months

164
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,680
into the Project Wikipedia had you know

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,300
like hundreds if not a thousand articles

166
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,940
and new pedia had like 60 or 70. like it

167
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,759
was very clear which project won

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,620
um and at this time the servers were in

169
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,180
San Diego California and they were owned

170
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,860
by you know this for-profit company

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,639
called bonus but volunteers got access

172
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,800
and within a few years you know bonus

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,259
realized the you know the leaders of

174
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,000
bonus including like Jimmy Wales

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,580
realized how important Wikipedia was not

176
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,440
just as a commercial thing but also as

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,300
just a resource for public good and they

178
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,039
split it off into the Wikimedia

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,199
Foundation as a non-profit that would be

180
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,759
you know that would like Safeguard the

181
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,080
legacy of it going forwards

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
um and then in 2004 the servers would

183
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
move to Tampa Florida and that was

184
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,699
primarily because the co-founder of

185
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,440
Wikipedia Jimmy Wales lived there and he

186
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
was the one who you know like installed

187
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
the first Tampa servers

188
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,020
coincidentally this was also the time

189
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,940
that the first off-site backup of

190
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,740
Wikipedia was taken because they were

191
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,800
afraid of hurricanes and it is kind of

192
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,840
wild to think today that no one bothered

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
to take a backup of Wikipedia for three

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,060
years knowing how important it is today

195
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,800
that you know we were like one failed

196
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,180
hard drive away from not having

197
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,720
Wikipedia or having to start all over

198
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,379
today the the story is very different

199
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,520
there are six different data centers

200
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,560
around the globe that you know serve

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,620
Wikipedia users there are two core data

202
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,319
centers in Virginia and in Texas that

203
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,120
run the media Wiki software and serve

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,460
the wiki platform and then there are

205
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,500
four caching point of presence data

206
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,599
centers that are in San Francisco the

207
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,300
Netherlands Singapore and the new one

208
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,400
just opened up in France earlier this

209
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,020
year and is starting to serve traffic

210
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,860
um and this is a this is an overview of

211
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,199
the the technical architecture of how

212
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,879
like your web request flows starting

213
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,580
like coming in from the caching layer to

214
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,200
the application servers and then how it

215
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
hits the storage layer I'm not going to

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,860
explain this I'm mainly showing this for

217
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,320
two purposes one to give you an idea of

218
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,719
the complexity of the technical stack

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,860
um you can see that there's a lot of

220
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,180
different components there's a lot of

221
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
you know different caching layers and

222
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,339
um and you know ways that data moves

223
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,080
through the flow and also the second

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
thing is to show you that this diagram

225
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,380
is publicly available on the internet

226
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,540
you can read it you can like look at it

227
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,820
it gets updated every few years or so as

228
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,760
as technology changes and if you go to

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,500
our technical Wiki which I'll I'll link

230
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,959
later you can just type in any of these

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,519
different components you know whether

232
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,440
it's like the back end cache or whether

233
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,080
it's you know how we use uh you know

234
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,140
things like router and Envoy and you can

235
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
just type them into the wiki and you'll

236
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,080
find like all of our technical

237
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
documentation on how we use it what we

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,980
use it for where it's deployed where you

239
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,080
can find the configuration all of that

240
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,980
is publicly available

241
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
um so these are you know like the main

242
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,600
like technical like points you get in

243
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,700
that'll that'll go over today so the

244
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,140
first is like where we host our code

245
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,120
which is on on this code review system

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
called Garrett and is also married to

247
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,540
GitHub just for convenience and to make

248
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,760
it easier for people to find

249
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,920
um we publish our metrics and statistics

250
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,720
at

251
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,920
grafana.wikomedia.org our bugs are

252
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,540
tracked in a system called fabricator

253
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,459
and you can see the URL and then our

254
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,140
documentation is kind of spread out we

255
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,080
have two different wikis

256
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,920
wikitech.wikimedia.org which is mainly

257
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
focused on the Wikimedia specific

258
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,339
documentation of how we deploy things

259
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,220
and mediawiki.org which is really you

260
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,959
know about the media Wiki software which

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,440
can be used by anyone but is also has

262
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
stuff that's applicable to how you know

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Wikipedia uses media Wiki and

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,860
doc.wikimedia.org is another place for

265
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,660
documentation and that's mostly like you

266
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,519
know auto-generated documentation from

267
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,760
code

268
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,300
um

269
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,680
so in in the last 90 days uh we saw

270
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,060
around 13 000 patches submitted and from

271
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,420
you know over 350 different authors some

272
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,339
of whom are staff and some of whom are

273
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,820
volunteers uh all patches to the media

274
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,560
Wiki code base have to be approved by

275
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,660
someone with like we call them plus two

276
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,459
rights and basically you have to you

277
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,140
vote plus two on the change and then the

278
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
change will get merged if it passes CI

279
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,760
and code gets deployed once a week we

280
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,320
create a branch and then that branch is

281
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,700
progressively rolled out from the

282
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,560
smaller wikis to the biggest ones

283
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,540
including the English Wikipedia and we

284
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,360
call that the deployment train and all

285
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,220
the servers are are like maintained

286
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,779
using a system called puppet and that

287
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,279
code is deployed immediately and I'll

288
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,540
talk about puppet a little bit later

289
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,279
so who is submitting media Wiki patches

290
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,899
and remember how I said earlier it's a

291
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,279
collaboration between staff and

292
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,220
volunteers and aside from the fact that

293
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,700
a dude named Sam is incredibly awesome

294
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
um you know it's actually a pretty clear

295
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,720
breakdown of you know about half the

296
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,339
patches about you know half of the

297
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,839
people on the list are staff and half of

298
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,060
them are volunteers and when I looked at

299
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,800
the like the actual breakdown of

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,899
everyone it was around like 53 percent

301
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,640
of patches are submitted by staff and

302
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
the rest come from volunteers so it

303
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,140
actually is like a pretty a pretty close

304
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,100
equilibrium between staff and volunteers

305
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,420
um and then on the flip side who's

306
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,700
approving these patches and it's

307
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,500
actually pretty similar that like in the

308
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,240
top six people you know half our staff

309
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
and half are volunteers and this is like

310
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,040
you know like once a patch is merged

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,300
it'll it'll it'll automatically get

312
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
deployed and so you know volunteers

313
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,839
actually do have significant power in

314
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,420
getting you know Patches from you know

315
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,980
reviewing them and getting them deployed

316
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,579
into production

317
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,300
um so puppet is uh it's like a way to

318
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,860
declaratively State what should be

319
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,720
installed or running on a server you

320
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,220
know it's similar to ansible and other

321
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,160
tools in that category

322
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,440
um it it basically is is rude puppet

323
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,740
runs as as roots so it's limited to our

324
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,779
site reliability engineers and a few

325
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,420
volunteers who also have root

326
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,820
um and the puppet code is is public you

327
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,160
can find the gear repository but uh

328
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,959
We've we've all the passwords and secret

329
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,820
keys are in a private repository that

330
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,320
only exists in like in the production

331
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,300
servers

332
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,220
um and other people who don't have

333
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,540
access to service can actually test

334
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,899
their puppet patches in Virtual machines

335
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,279
um if you've never seen puppet code

336
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,720
before this is kind of what it looks

337
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,700
like it's this like mishmash of a ruby

338
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,160
syntax with this like custom puppet

339
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,139
syntax but

340
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,700
um and this is like what how how we

341
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,519
deploy media Wiki web servers

342
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,740
um but like I mentioned the really cool

343
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,720
thing is that anyone can grab our puppet

344
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,180
code and test it in a virtual machine so

345
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,040
we have another team called cloud

346
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,899
services that basically that provides

347
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,180
you know Computing resources which is an

348
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,579
openstack deployment for volunteers and

349
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,680
staff and you can take the same puppet

350
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,019
code that is running in production and

351
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,360
you can just spin up a VM apply the the

352
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,160
puppet roll and you can be running these

353
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,040
roughly as close as you can the same

354
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,540
exact code that's running in production

355
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,779
on your VM the only difference is is you

356
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,579
don't have any private user data so we

357
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,500
can give out access to this VM that is

358
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,060
running you know again nearly identical

359
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,519
code to anyone and this means that it's

360
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,300
really easy for volunteers to test their

361
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,100
code have a simulated working

362
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,740
environment you using the same system

363
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,199
that is running in production

364
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,699
um and and it really makes it a lot more

365
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,240
accessible to contribute and and so then

366
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
the like one of the key features is that

367
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,139
we have this beta cluster uh which is a

368
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,480
replica of some of the production wikis

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,060
that we have and it's just running the

370
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,980
latest version of media Wiki like as

371
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,320
it's been merged into Master to catch

372
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,000
different integration issues and again

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,519
we can give out access to this beta

374
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,139
cluster where people can test their

375
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,060
media code or debug problems in in

376
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,760
midwiki code without have it we can give

377
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,500
it out access much more liberally than

378
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,360
we do on production servers just because

379
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,459
there's really no private user data here

380
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:32,940
um

381
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,060
and in a similar vein we have database

382
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,500
replicas and so we everything is stored

383
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,540
in or most of the database stuff is

384
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,519
stored in mariadb and so we have

385
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,800
redacted replicas of these databases are

386
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
available to cloud service VMS and you

387
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
know like if you want to do stuff

388
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,579
locally you can set up an SSH tunnel and

389
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,019
so basically we have all these rules

390
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,120
that strip out all of the private data

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
out of or like you know like in all the

392
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,959
fields or xero them

393
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,940
um and then return the rows that are

394
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,660
public

395
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,579
and so then you know now what's the next

396
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,440
step after that we have we have a web

397
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,660
tool that allows you to just run SQL

398
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,060
queries straight from the web it's like

399
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,760
phpmyadmin but like actually secure

400
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,459
um and uh one of the really cool things

401
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,500
is that once like a technical user who

402
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,779
understands SQL like writes a query we

403
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,940
see non-technical users or I don't even

404
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,160
consider them non-technical but like

405
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,380
traditionally non-technical users we'll

406
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,199
just start learning SQL via copy paste

407
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
and modify they'll start tweaking the

408
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
queries they'll you know like just first

409
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,880
It'll Be Strings that are really easy to

410
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,560
modify then they'll start adding new

411
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,360
conditions or copying and pasting from

412
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,399
other queries combining them together

413
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,259
and it's really powerful and it's really

414
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,759
cool to see that you know like just

415
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,019
because we made this resource available

416
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,240
people are who are you know would

417
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
consider themselves traditionally

418
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
non-technical users or don't have a

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,500
computer science or programming

420
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,019
background are actually writing SQL

421
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,899
queries to get data based on you know

422
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,459
like the maintenance tasks that they

423
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,660
want to do on wikis

424
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,120
um so shifting gears uh like I said

425
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,980
earlier we publish all we publish most

426
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,600
of our statistics and metrics and so

427
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,579
this is the

428
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,300
um

429
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,040
this is how many requests per second

430
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,040
we're getting globally and so as the

431
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,139
seven most visited website that amounts

432
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,779
to Ed Peak around 130 000 requests per

433
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,040
second

434
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,199
um and the the shape of the graph is

435
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,000
actually people being awake and going to

436
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,320
sleep that's that's how our traffic

437
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,779
patterns are determined

438
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:31,860
um and these are just some more

439
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,300
statistics you know we have the total

440
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,759
total request volume you know how many

441
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,259
errors we're serving and you can see

442
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,820
that in the error chart clearly we were

443
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,500
having some problems at the beginning of

444
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,139
it before they all like zeroed out and

445
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,940
another metrical measure is successful

446
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,620
Wiki edits like if everyone stops

447
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,060
editing that means there's a problem on

448
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,540
the wikis

449
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,579
um and you can like get this breakdown

450
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,380
for in the health of like individual

451
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,139
servers so this is MW 1312 which is the

452
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,880
media Wiki app server living in the

453
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,220
Virginia cluster and you can see like

454
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,919
the CPU the memory usage networking you

455
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,780
know if I if you like scroll down

456
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,160
farther you can see like temperature

457
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
load averages you know you can you can

458
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,419
like break this down for and every

459
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,980
server and virtual machine that we run

460
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,020
in our production cluster has has is on

461
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,299
this page

462
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,740
um and you can look at the database

463
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,679
layer this is an aggregated shot of all

464
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,359
of the database rows that are being

465
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,339
written and read to every single one of

466
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,039
our database clusters

467
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,140
and you can also look at it at the data

468
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,600
center level like this is our Singapore

469
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,940
Data Center and you can see that like

470
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,919
Asia's is clearly waking up and starting

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,780
to access more data on Wikipedia so that

472
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,760
way that the networking charts are like

473
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
going up

474
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,820
um and and you can look at what

475
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,260
basically like how many servers there

476
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,520
are in our data center all this

477
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
information is publicly accessible and

478
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,940
anyone can just start browsing through

479
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,200
it and learning things

480
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,340
um and so like on Wikipedia we have talk

481
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Pages a lot of the all most of the

482
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,960
communication around this development

483
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,179
happens in public as well so we have it

484
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,559
we have a traditional mailing list

485
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,380
called wikitech L then we have the like

486
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,720
fabricator and Garrett comments and then

487
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,299
we have a whole host of IRC channels on

488
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,460
the Liberia chat Network and the biggest

489
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,140
channels of these are are bridge to

490
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,000
Matrix to you know provide a little more

491
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,919
nicer user interface for people who are

492
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,220
not used to IRC

493
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,559
uh so now I kind of like want to walk

494
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
through an example of how transparency

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,640
was key in solving an outage and so this

496
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,740
this happened uh towards the end of 2021

497
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,039
and uh users can upload files to to

498
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,400
Wikipedia and we have a Max file size of

499
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,380
four gigabytes but like I mentioned

500
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,059
earlier we have two core data centers

501
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,160
and so when you upload a file you're in

502
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,780
the back end it's actually being copied

503
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,880
over to both data centers so you have

504
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,460
one upload and it ends up in a system

505
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,380
called Swift which is like the openstack

506
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,400
version of S3 and so you know your file

507
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,960
is uploaded very quickly to the local

508
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,720
data center and then it also has to take

509
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,340
the round it has to take the extra cost

510
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,200
of going from one data center to the

511
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,460
other so the you know speed of light

512
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,500
from Virginia to Texas

513
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,140
and so what we found was that for

514
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,780
whatever reason files were being were

515
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,700
cross were going from to the other data

516
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,799
center very slowly

517
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,260
um and it was about two megabytes per

518
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,780
second and we have a 300 second timeout

519
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,700
which basically gives you a 600 megabyte

520
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,620
file and people are uploading files up

521
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,840
to four gigabytes in size and so this is

522
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,140
a real problem for any large file upload

523
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,240
and this coincided with the upgrade of

524
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,340
our servers from Debian stretch to

525
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Debian Buster so something in that large

526
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,559
upgrade caused these file uploads to

527
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,700
slow down

528
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,919
and we you know we didn't really have a

529
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,220
good clue of of what it could be

530
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,580
um and so as as like I was the lead

531
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,500
person investigating this

532
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
um and so

533
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,539
uh my first step was basically to like

534
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,880
try and reconstruct you know like can I

535
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,159
minimize the code can I just use plain a

536
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,799
curl command and send the code can can I

537
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,539
get the upload to finish in time or can

538
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,760
I or will it be really slow and then

539
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,919
also can I just write like now using

540
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,559
like uh like a very minimized PHP

541
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
reproduction of like stripping the code

542
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,159
out of the two main classes that are

543
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,500
responsible for handling file uploads

544
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,360
can I like minimize it down to just like

545
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,580
the very Basics so that way that still

546
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,080
reproduce the issues so we can you know

547
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,820
like run it under s trace and a few

548
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,080
other things

549
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,360
and what I found was that when I ran it

550
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,159
with you know the command line curl it

551
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,140
finished instantly but when I ran it

552
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,120
with the PHP code it was still slow

553
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
which is great now I have like two

554
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,419
different things that we can compare and

555
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,340
so in the fabricator ticket I pasted

556
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,020
like everything that I was doing all the

557
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,400
commands I was running and all the

558
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
output that I got

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
and you know I have a little more

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
debugging like okay if I like switched

561
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,600
using instead of using curl and PHP if I

562
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,299
use stream wrappers then it it still

563
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,740
works but

564
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,500
um you know it it stream wrappers have a

565
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,039
much smaller Max file size and uh I

566
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,600
noted that like we had as part of the

567
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,159
upgrade from stretch to Buster we had

568
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,340
upgraded lib curl you know from uh you

569
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,100
know 7.52 to 7.64 so there were going to

570
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,480
be changes and maybe it was one of those

571
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,700
changes

572
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,220
uh and my like final ashtray showed that

573
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,080
it was like calling F read a lot and I

574
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
thought that was suspicious and then I

575
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
went to sleep and my colleagues took

576
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,460
over

577
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,440
um and they said that you know okay my

578
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,820
hypothesis is correct but it's not like

579
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,440
the F reads ciscalls that are causing it

580
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,720
it's the fact that we're making 820

581
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,400
round trips between the data centers

582
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,440
because we're making really small chunks

583
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,260
and the the round trips will add up a

584
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,640
lot just because we're in a different

585
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,380
Data Center and that's what was causing

586
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,140
was causing it to take so long and you

587
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,400
know they did some more like statistical

588
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,080
analysis and Wireshark that showed like

589
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,159
this is clearly the problem we're

590
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,480
sending too many round trips and it's

591
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,980
going too slowly

592
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,260
and then a volunteer who was following a

593
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,360
ticket and this volunteer has no server

594
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,539
access no access to private data and you

595
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,919
know probably doesn't have a full

596
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,179
understanding of like the technical

597
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,500
architecture but they were reading the

598
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,299
ticket they were following along and all

599
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,799
of us who had been commenting so far had

600
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,480
been doing so in like a very verbose way

601
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,740
where everything we were doing was

602
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,740
written out and the volunteer says you

603
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,840
know but the command line curl output is

604
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
using HTTP one and the lib curl app from

605
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,539
PHP is using hp2 can we you know either

606
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,460
force one of them to use hp2 or force

607
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,059
hp1 and that was actually the issue was

608
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,620
the fact that the use of HTTP 2 was

609
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,059
causing it to do way more round trips

610
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,919
than necessary and as soon as we forced

611
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,200
it to use HTTP 1 as the volunteer

612
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
noticed was was wrong you know that

613
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,940
immediately fixed the issue the uploads

614
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,760
finished incredibly quickly and at that

615
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
point it was okay just write a patch to

616
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,740
force it to use HTTP one and and we're

617
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,780
set and then the volunteer in a later

618
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,520
comment actually found like in the lib

619
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,320
curl changelog where it says okay we're

620
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
going to default HTTP 2 now if the

621
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,679
method is not explicitly specified

622
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,020
during in the in the change log period

623
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,240
from stretch to Buster and so that like

624
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,760
totally validated our Theory and at the

625
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,500
same time you know this came from a

626
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,480
volunteer

627
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,419
and in the end it was the verbosely

628
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,640
pasting publicly is what allowed this

629
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,000
volunteer to come up and solve the issue

630
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,919
and it's likely that you know the the

631
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,960
staff sres you know we would have

632
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,940
figured out the real cause eventually

633
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,860
but I think it would have taken more

634
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,500
time a few days at least

635
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,360
um and we have like a full incident

636
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,100
report that you can read and that

637
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,679
incident report also links to a really

638
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,720
good cloudflare blog post that explains

639
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,360
why in certain conditions hb2 is

640
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,360
actually slower than HTTP one so if

641
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
you're interested in the technical

642
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,460
reasoning behind it I would recommend

643
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,000
reading that

644
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,460
um so jumping over to IRC we have a ton

645
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,080
of IRC channels this is the list of

646
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,419
technical IRC channels that go from M to

647
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,799
T because that's how much I could fit

648
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,140
into the screenshot uh there's a lot

649
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,460
more

650
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,320
um and you can like peruse the list of

651
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
IRC channels you can join them they're

652
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,919
most nearly all of them are publicly

653
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,600
open and a lot of them are actually

654
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
publicly logged so you can actually go

655
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,900
back and read

656
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,779
um old conversations

657
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,820
um these are the main three channels

658
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,059
that uh you know if you're interested

659
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,320
there's the operations Channel which is

660
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
the main coordination Channel where

661
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,820
deployments happen where incident

662
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,440
incident discussion happens there's the

663
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,000
SRE Channel which is the discussion

664
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,299
amongst uh sres and there's the tech

665
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,980
Channel which is for like end user

666
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,900
support and help and people will often

667
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,340
just ask questions and just have General

668
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,559
like anything that fits under technical

669
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,539
discussion is is like totally on topic

670
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,980
there

671
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,299
um and we also have a private security

672
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,760
channel for dealing with DDOS attacks

673
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,640
and active security issues

674
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,460
um and that is used pretty sparingly

675
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,140
just because everyone in that channel

676
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,240
also recognizes that using that channel

677
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,640
is excluding a significant amount of

678
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,679
volunteers and even staff members who

679
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,940
are not in that channel and that's why

680
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,600
discussing things publicly is preferred

681
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,539
so this is this is from Thursday

682
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,279
um

683
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,080
and this is just a snippet of an IRC log

684
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,779
from the operations Channel and this is

685
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,020
uh Tavi a volunteer uh pinging to the

686
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,159
people who are responsible for the

687
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
deployment asking if the deployment can

688
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
be rolled back because it's broken

689
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,520
coincidentally again uploads

690
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,120
um

691
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,059
can you imagine going on an IRC Channel

692
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,159
and pinging someone from Amazon Google

693
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,020
or Facebook saying hey your deployment

694
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,720
is broken can you please roll back like

695
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,080
this level of like access is is really

696
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,200
like you don't have that anywhere else

697
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,720
um and within within you know like three

698
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,640
or four minutes you know Gina says okay

699
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,159
I'll I'll roll back and then uh and then

700
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,779
the you know the deployment tool says

701
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,640
you know yes it's uh Gina has rolled

702
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,900
back the wikis

703
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,900
um to a previous version and the

704
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,640
deployment tool uses this thing called

705
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,700
like an exclamation mark log which means

706
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,620
that all of the entries end up in what

707
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,039
we call the server admin log and this is

708
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,200
a log for like any action that happens

709
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,820
on a server that isn't going to be

710
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,460
reflected anywhere else like you know

711
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,559
like when you like merge a patch it gets

712
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,900
it's logged in git right but for a lot

713
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,340
of options like if you're rebooting a

714
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,900
server or if you're adjusting some

715
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,000
configuration in a database like etcd

716
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,340
then those thing or or do pooling a

717
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,960
server like the those things are not

718
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,460
reflected anywhere else except on the

719
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,260
server and you're like bash history and

720
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,299
so the server admin log like collects

721
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,039
all of that and all of our deployment

722
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,039
tools will automatically send logs to to

723
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,260
the server admin log and you just type

724
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,080
in you know exclamation mark log in IRC

725
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,059
and it'll go to a Wiki page it'll go to

726
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,580
Mastodon and it'll go to Twitter and on

727
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,320
the right I have the Twitter search for

728
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,799
the word oops and the server admin log

729
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,559
and the other fun one to search is WTF

730
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,120
and and you know you can see what people

731
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,740
were frustrated with like five or six

732
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,940
years ago

733
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,640
and uh the Twitter and Mastodon

734
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,620
integration is kind of new but the wiki

735
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,880
archives go back to June 2004 which is

736
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
you know you can see what Wikimedia

737
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,720
assist admins have been doing all the

738
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
way starting in June 2004 up until like

739
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,520
literally right now there's you know

740
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,500
just pages of archives and you can

741
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,880
search through them you can read through

742
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
them you can see like people like

743
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,779
reverting stuff dealing with outages not

744
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:25,799
knowing what they're doing where you can

745
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,179
just like see like general maintenance

746
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,940
like pooling and deep pooling servers so

747
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,320
there's a lot of like valuable history

748
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,740
there

749
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,840
um the other thing that's that's really

750
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,720
cool on IRC in the operations channel is

751
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,279
UM most of our alerts and monitoring

752
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,260
will will show up there and so we use a

753
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,779
combination of asinga and alert manager

754
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,940
to to do notifications and this is when

755
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,159
there was like a blip in networking and

756
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,380
so a singer thought a bunch of hosts

757
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,299
were down

758
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,620
um just because it couldn't reach them

759
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,340
and the two lines that I bolded have the

760
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,539
word like hash page in them and that's

761
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,640
special because it means that sres were

762
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,919
paged for that so you can see that sres

763
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,659
have already been paged and you don't

764
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:10,919
need to like try and ping someone

765
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,840
independently that all of these alerts

766
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,000
have gone off and both of those are

767
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
database servers that's why they they

768
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,419
triggered pages but

769
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,100
um and then at the very bottom you can

770
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,860
see um Reuben going uh-oh like because

771
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,480
he's been paged and within a minute he's

772
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,700
on IRC being like why are all these

773
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,740
servers disappearing

774
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,860
um

775
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,659
um so far everything I've talked about

776
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,580
has been public right you know there's

777
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,260
like a lot of information that's public

778
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,299
that's on you know on the wikis and in

779
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,159
fabricator that you can and IRC that you

780
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,320
can all access but there is some private

781
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,360
information that we do have overall

782
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,220
Wikipedia has like very little private

783
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,960
information compared to most websites we

784
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,100
don't collect your address we don't

785
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,600
collect your credit card information we

786
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,159
don't you know collect your phone number

787
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,740
and even registering with your email is

788
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,480
optional literally the only private

789
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,460
thing we have is your password and

790
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,140
possibly your email address if you chose

791
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,179
to give it so there's very little

792
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,340
private information

793
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200
um but still

794
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,100
um

795
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,440
um volunteers need to sign an NDA to get

796
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,960
access to like debug logs web requests

797
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,059
logs you know we have slow SQL queries

798
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,480
that can be used as as dos vectors or

799
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
security tickets and so the the NDA

800
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,279
process you know you can like re the NDA

801
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,360
is not even secret you can read the

802
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,600
terms on the wiki itself and uh the bar

803
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,340
for like signing in NDA has been lowered

804
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,159
over time uh previously you needed like

805
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
c-level sign off on on everything until

806
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,140
I give a volunteer access and now any

807
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,120
Wikipedia Foundation employee can vouch

808
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,100
for you and then you know the legal

809
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,720
department will like prepare the NDA and

810
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,659
get assigned and when I checked earlier

811
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,760
this week there were exactly 100 users

812
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,460
in in our like NDA ldap Group which it

813
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,500
controls and so there's a there's like a

814
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,539
decent amount of um and all those people

815
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,240
are are like volunteers none of them are

816
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,679
Foundation staff which has a separate

817
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,960
group so that that really shows like the

818
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,700
the like scope of people of even even

819
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,960
for like this like private information

820
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,580
we've we've been able to expand the

821
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,000
access for it

822
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,799
and server access not like the little

823
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,080
kitten has gotten but real you know SSH

824
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,620
access again volunteers need to sign an

825
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,159
NDA and go through a form of deployment

826
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,620
training and this is this access is

827
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,299
controlled by the release engineering

828
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,500
team which is the one that coordinates

829
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,320
and manages most of the deployments

830
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,320
um there are about seven volunteers with

831
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,940
media Wiki deployment access they can

832
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,320
deploy patches they can deploy security

833
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,120
patches you know they can inspect the

834
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,640
state of of code they can do interactive

835
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,380
debugging

836
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,179
um there are only two volunteers with

837
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,580
root one of them is me

838
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,919
um and me and and the other person who

839
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,960
is a volunteer with both former staff

840
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,700
and

841
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,020
um in the past there used to be

842
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,240
volunteers with root which I think was a

843
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,919
really good like equalizing principle

844
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,659
and good governance that it's a mix of

845
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,340
volunteers and staff who are making

846
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,340
these like root level decisions but over

847
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,740
the years that you know the SRE team has

848
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,840
be grown more professionalized and it's

849
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,760
expanded a lot that it's really hard for

850
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,679
volunteers to justify root access

851
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,320
because anytime you need something with

852
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,299
root access it's not like oh I'm blocked

853
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,559
on it because you're just paying someone

854
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,539
and you know someone on the SRE team

855
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,120
will be awake and be able to help you

856
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,039
um I would like to see that that change

857
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,779
I think it's important that there are

858
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,320
volunteers with root access but you know

859
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,940
it it's kind of a practical problem

860
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,419
right now

861
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,659
um

862
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,640
all of what I have talked about so hard

863
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,679
so far about like transparency and

864
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,200
access I I think it's it's important not

865
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,360
to understand how hard this can be to

866
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,820
keep up to keep this culture up

867
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,760
um it is a constant fight to keep things

868
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,820
transparent a lot of the systems that we

869
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,220
have are designed to be opened by

870
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,480
default

871
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,799
um you know like Garrett is public

872
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,720
fabricator is mostly public all of our

873
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,700
statistics are are public our IRC

874
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,559
channels are public you know so as long

875
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,539
as you like use those venues you know

876
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,100
your things will be public by default

877
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,440
but regardless of this people still like

878
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,419
Trend towards closed platforms like

879
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,580
people want to use slack instead of IRC

880
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,200
people want to use Google Docs instead

881
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,380
of Wiki pages and you know it can be it

882
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,940
can be difficult to like constantly be

883
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,980
the source of friction being like hey I

884
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,600
know you shared a Google doc with me can

885
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,100
you actually like just post it on the

886
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,539
wiki and I'll give you my feedback there

887
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,880
or when someone pings you on like the

888
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,980
internal like Wikimedia Foundation slack

889
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,360
like actually this is a discussion we

890
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,039
should be having in public you know so

891
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,080
that way volunteers can participate can

892
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
we move it to IRC

893
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,080
um and it you know it's difficult

894
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,340
especially when the when like you're

895
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,539
being pinged and the answer is just like

896
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,159
yes you know like do you really are you

897
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,659
really going to force the person to like

898
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,100
contact shift just to give them that

899
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,539
answer

900
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,519
um

901
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,200
and then there are some things that have

902
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,620
to be private like legal advice lawyers

903
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,000
um are you know can only give legal

904
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,460
advice to like the company and so you

905
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,419
know the only people who can actually

906
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,340
read their like detailed advice are are

907
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,899
Foundation staff and then the foundation

908
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,880
staff have to like summarize it to the

909
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,559
volunteers and be like this is what the

910
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,299
lawyers said and I'm sorry I can't

911
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,799
explain it to you but this is what we

912
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,480
have to do because the lawyer said so

913
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,399
and and that can be that can be

914
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,360
frustrating

915
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,860
um especially if you disagree with the

916
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,539
lawyers

917
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,539
um and then I I think that people can

918
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,340
really be intimidated by having to do

919
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,500
everything publicly

920
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,299
um you know Wikimedia also has like a

921
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,460
very strong component of value of

922
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,380
privacy and yet we're asking everyone to

923
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,940
do everything in public and you know

924
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,440
these things are archived you know once

925
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,340
they're public on the internet they're

926
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,960
archived forever and we keep our own

927
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,899
records forever and the idea that you

928
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,240
know any mistake or silly comment or a

929
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,919
bad joke you know especially if it you

930
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,440
know as aged poorly over time you know

931
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
is going to be public and archived

932
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,080
forever do you really want that and uh

933
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,779
I was in an interview for my new job and

934
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,519
the person interviewing me pulled up a

935
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,320
random wiki page that you know like I

936
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,000
had worked on like a technical proposal

937
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,460
and being like all of these users you

938
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,500
know didn't like your proposal what do

939
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,899
you have to say about that you know and

940
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,480
I was like like oh my goodness like you

941
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
know like yeah they did say that you

942
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,199
know like they didn't like my proposal

943
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,119
but um but you know I discussed it in

944
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,040
like the idea is that like any future

945
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,899
employer or interviewer can just pull up

946
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,460
what you've been working on and read all

947
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,320
of your comments is is I think it's kind

948
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,119
of intimidating

949
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,739
um I think the one thing that you know

950
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,540
Works in our favor is that we're very

951
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,639
happy for people to be you know publicly

952
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,980
Anonymous and even like there are people

953
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,320
with um you know merge rights to Media

954
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,480
Wiki who we don't actually know their

955
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,159
real name or their real life identity

956
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,359
it's just that they've done good work

957
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,739
they've become trusted in the community

958
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,320
and so we've given them the rights to

959
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,418
sign the NDA you do have to use your

960
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,760
legal name but there's no uh the legal

961
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,139
name can just be restricted to the

962
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,060
lawyers and it can be made it can be

963
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,800
kept private so the fact that we allow

964
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,139
people to contribute anonymously does

965
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,699
kind of mitigate that a bit but I think

966
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,040
it it can turn people off and is is

967
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,940
something to keep in mind

968
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,099
um so finally what what what can you do

969
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,320
you know I think that this model for

970
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,660
transparency is not something that is

971
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,420
like uniquely special to Wikimedia that

972
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,700
only we can do it I think that any other

973
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,160
public interest website should try and

974
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,380
do the same and I think that even if you

975
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,760
do it for your personal website I think

976
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,020
that's good for the internet I think

977
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,640
this level of transparency you know

978
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,460
helps make the internet not suck

979
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,859
um and really the thing is to start

980
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,420
gradually don't try and make everything

981
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,220
public at once that that can be very

982
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,940
difficult and a real like culture Clash

983
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,680
I find that documentation is the easiest

984
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,599
place to start and I will say that wikis

985
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,460
are the best of course but you know like

986
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,380
even like you know markdown files and

987
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,960
git repository are are decent as well

988
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,240
you know as long as it's there

989
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,800
um and just start writing things down

990
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,420
even if it's just a list of like these

991
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,099
are the server components we use we use

992
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,339
nginx we use Python with like G unicorn

993
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,320
and you know we use it's managed by

994
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,700
System D units and even if that's

995
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
literally the list you know it's a place

996
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,320
to start and it's much easier to

997
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,240
iteratively add things than it is to

998
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,640
start from scratch and you know once

999
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,720
once you start building a community

1000
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,700
other people will start documenting

1001
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,579
things for you

1002
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,440
um and I'd also say that like it's okay

1003
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,780
to lose control you know like when it

1004
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,280
comes to our code we're like very picky

1005
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
about like the syntax and the spacing

1006
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,000
and the formatting and how methods are

1007
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,980
named and how you know like all of that

1008
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,720
and like you kind of have to like lose

1009
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,160
control with wikis like people will

1010
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,839
organize it the way they want and as

1011
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,060
long as it's not like destructive you

1012
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,760
know then then accept it and and Just Go

1013
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
with It the important thing is that

1014
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,400
people are contributing and and

1015
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,900
eventually you'll move in in the right

1016
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,820
direction and you'll you'll grow to like

1017
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,900
it

1018
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,880
um

1019
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,380
um then then you know after once you've

1020
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,880
started getting some documentation done

1021
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,380
you know start publishing your server

1022
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,000
configuration you know what does your

1023
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
your Apache configuration look like

1024
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,180
what's your nginx configuration look

1025
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,160
like what are the system D units that

1026
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,359
you're using

1027
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,820
um I like analogizing this to like how

1028
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,800
people publish their dot files you know

1029
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,660
like people like uh like want to show

1030
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,280
off the cool tricks they have in their

1031
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,619
dsh and their dot bash RC and there's

1032
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,020
like lists of like awesome dot files

1033
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,400
where you can see like a list of like

1034
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,900
other people who have really cool dot

1035
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,460
files and like how they've customized

1036
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,740
their bash prompt like people have like

1037
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,060
really cool tricks hidden in their

1038
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,800
server configuration like you should

1039
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,359
publish that too there's so there's a

1040
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,160
lot of like material that could be

1041
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,900
learned or just that's interesting to

1042
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,220
look at

1043
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,480
um you know the catches that you have to

1044
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
figure out how to separate your

1045
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,760
passwords and your private data from

1046
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,200
that but really that's a that's a best

1047
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,339
practice you should be aiming for

1048
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,500
anyways to separate private you know

1049
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,839
private data from um you know data

1050
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,760
that's that's not private

1051
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
um and then finally you know track track

1052
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,720
issues publicly uh this can be difficult

1053
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,460
because oftentimes you don't want to

1054
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,560
like you know show that you have bugs

1055
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,780
but uh this is also the best way to get

1056
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,280
people started is to show that it's not

1057
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,599
perfect and then there's room for

1058
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,720
improvement and you know uh even if you

1059
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,099
just literally like write like a line

1060
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,099
like this is buggy you know and and file

1061
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,960
that is the issue that that's fine as

1062
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,520
long as it's there and you know you

1063
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,839
might you don't know that if there's a

1064
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,880
volunteer or you know we've had issues

1065
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,680
we've had cases where like the Upstream

1066
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,240
author will like see the ticket in our

1067
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,980
boxer and they'll be like hey I'm the

1068
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,720
Upstream for this can I help you you

1069
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,700
know solve what your problem is and then

1070
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,320
you know even though you just had like

1071
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,119
one line then you like are prompted to

1072
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,820
go into more detail about uh about you

1073
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,680
know what the issue is

1074
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,660
um and having like an easy or good first

1075
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,760
task category is a is a good way for

1076
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,859
people to get started

1077
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,839
and then just in general just keep up

1078
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,599
the fight for transparency

1079
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,820
um you know like be the be the little

1080
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,200
source of friction you know choose your

1081
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,640
battles of when you want to ask people

1082
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
to document something publicly or or

1083
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,140
when you want to have a conversation in

1084
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,799
public as well

1085
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,640
um and if you're interested in

1086
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,260
contributing to Wikipedia we have a lot

1087
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,000
of work to do like I mentioned earlier

1088
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,040
we're five percent there you know

1089
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,839
whether you want to edit the projects or

1090
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,640
whether you want to you know contribute

1091
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,800
technically there's a lot of work the

1092
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,599
the easiest way is to just lurk in our

1093
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,400
IRC and Matrix channels you know

1094
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,720
something might catch your attention so

1095
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,099
I might be asking a question by about

1096
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,480
the thing you have like subject matter

1097
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,220
expertise in

1098
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,300
um or you might just find the

1099
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,579
conversations interesting

1100
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,920
um I have two QR codes on this Slide the

1101
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,079
first is the guide of how to become a

1102
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,400
media Wiki hacker which walks you

1103
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,720
through like setting up our git setup

1104
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,780
how to use like our Docker or VM based

1105
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,240
you know media Wiki setup and the second

1106
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,339
is actually this brand new Wikimedia

1107
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,440
developer portal which gives you a lot

1108
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,839
of uh Links of different other projects

1109
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,060
that are not explicitly media Wiki that

1110
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,440
still need contributions you know we

1111
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,240
have like bot Frameworks we have you

1112
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,920
know like different developer tooling

1113
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,440
there's a lot of stuff out there

1114
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,000
um

1115
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,359
and uh thank you that that's it we have

1116
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,000
um that's the QR code for the slides

1117
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
that's different ways you can reach me

1118
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,020
if you have questions and yeah if people

1119
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,440
have questions

1120
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:59,179
[Applause]

1121
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,680
yeah I think there's some mic back there

1122
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,399
if you want to use it

1123
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,000
thank you this was really interesting

1124
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
and I'm wondering since it sounds like

1125
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,500
you're sort of the biggest website to

1126
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,599
scale doing so much in public

1127
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,660
have you run into security issues by

1128
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,700
sort of having the biggest version of

1129
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,280
something so public and how have you

1130
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,599
resolved that friction does the question

1131
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,460
make sense yeah

1132
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,440
um yes uh this there's like a lot of

1133
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,700
people who are like afraid to like

1134
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,859
publish version numbers or you know

1135
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,140
details about that but

1136
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,760
um I think the main thing is that you

1137
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,380
have to stay on top of security

1138
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,720
practices just in general like you have

1139
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,819
to be tracking you know the Upstream

1140
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,380
security issues you have to be tracking

1141
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,880
you know like so we're we're all based

1142
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,040
on Debian and in fact one of the members

1143
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,839
of the Debian security team works for

1144
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,579
the Wikimedia foundation and so we're

1145
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,380
like always up to date on what the

1146
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,319
existing security issues are and

1147
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,359
um we actually take it a step further

1148
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,760
um and uh I had this prepared um we like

1149
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,319
publish all of the version numbers if

1150
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,660
you go to special version on any media

1151
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,579
Wiki installation you can see like what

1152
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,200
the media Wiki version is what the PHP

1153
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,940
version what the database is you know

1154
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,380
and all these different services and you

1155
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,640
can see all the extensions installed

1156
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,140
what their versions are what the you

1157
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,240
know PHP libraries we use

1158
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,280
um in general I think security through

1159
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,680
obscurity doesn't work you know like at

1160
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,300
best all we get is all these like

1161
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,040
automated scanner reports from people

1162
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,540
looking for bug bounties saying like oh

1163
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,160
you're using an unsupported version of

1164
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,540
this you have this bug and then you're

1165
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,160
like did you actually test the bug it

1166
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,359
doesn't work because we're using a

1167
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,760
patched version of the software

1168
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
um so yeah I

1169
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,839
um I you know like they're always times

1170
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,359
you know like when uh

1171
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,400
that people people do find security

1172
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,200
holes and and we just have to patch them

1173
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,780
and uh we have we have practices for

1174
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,280
deploying security patches privately

1175
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,900
that then get you know responsibly

1176
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,400
disclosed to like other people using

1177
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,780
media Wiki

1178
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,099
um but but the answer is like you just

1179
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,359
have to stay on top of security whether

1180
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,560
you make it public or private

1181
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,740
hi there uh first of all thanks uh that

1182
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,900
was a great talk uh one thing that I'm

1183
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,420
wondering about is uh are there any sort

1184
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,760
of like statistics on volunteer burnout

1185
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,880
if such a thing exists

1186
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,099
um I don't have any statistics offhand

1187
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,380
but I know it's a real thing uh

1188
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,500
volunteer burnout is is real

1189
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,780
um you know I think that people you know

1190
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,140
like oftentimes there so it works both

1191
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,460
ways there are volunteers who are still

1192
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,200
involved who are like around in like

1193
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,740
2005 2006 and then there are also people

1194
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,560
who like will show up for you know like

1195
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,660
one year provide these awesome

1196
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,000
contributions you know like you get them

1197
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,220
they're like merge rights and then they

1198
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,839
just disappear and you never hear from

1199
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,220
them again and have no way to contact

1200
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,599
them

1201
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,359
um it it's a mix of both I I think you

1202
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,859
know the main thing is that we have to

1203
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:00,060
like strengthen and grow the community

1204
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,579
so that no one person feels overburdened

1205
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,660
that they have too many maintenance

1206
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,099
responsibilities and we can share the

1207
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,319
load and if people need time off we

1208
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,940
should give them time off rather than

1209
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,579
letting them go all the way up burn out

1210
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,400
and then we lose them forever

1211
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,940
thanks

1212
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:31,980
um I have a thank you for the talk I

1213
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,720
have a few questions for you uh you can

1214
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,760
pick your favorite amongst

1215
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,440
um One technical questions I'm curious

1216
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,839
uh if you could say something about your

1217
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,180
usage of openstack

1218
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,819
um how you use it your experience uh

1219
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,740
what you chose to use it uh second

1220
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,780
question uh you said fighting for

1221
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,119
transparency which I think there's a

1222
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,560
commitment to transparency at the

1223
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
foundation of Wikipedia that is

1224
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,599
wonderful and awesome and so strong

1225
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,060
in your own word

1226
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,280
what would you say is that strength

1227
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,099
coming from uh I could say it in my own

1228
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,780
word but I'm really curious to see how

1229
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,880
you would articulate it

1230
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,440
sorry could you clarify the last part

1231
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,180
about transparency what were you asking

1232
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,099
where does that strength of commitment

1233
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,920
comes from when the going gots hard

1234
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,960
right you mentioned that takes an effort

1235
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,180
to maintain that transparency where does

1236
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,520
that strength come from

1237
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,099
um yeah so I'll answer this one first

1238
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,020
um you know transparency is really about

1239
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,200
like making sure that in the future uh

1240
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,180
we have access to this information you

1241
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,040
know like if I discussed a technical

1242
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,020
problem in like PM with in with someone

1243
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,420
and lost the IRC logs then like we have

1244
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,280
no no way of knowing what the rationale

1245
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,000
was and uh you know I think that doing

1246
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,099
things in public really builds up the

1247
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:48,900
the ability for other developers like

1248
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,880
I've learned a lot just from observing

1249
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,560
other IRC conversations with other

1250
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,180
people seeing how they discuss things

1251
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,800
and seeing how they were able to solve

1252
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,440
problems and that really brings up the

1253
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,880
whole community that sense of feeling

1254
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,760
involved and really the idea that you

1255
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,160
know like we have a long ways to go you

1256
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,780
know we've we've been here for 20 years

1257
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,400
and we have probably we like we want to

1258
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,619
be here forever and so retaining our

1259
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,359
history and that kind of institutional

1260
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,280
knowledge is incredibly important and

1261
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,599
really the easiest way to do that is

1262
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,819
through transparency

1263
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,680
um and then and then about openstack so

1264
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,960
the openstack cluster I don't have any

1265
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,359
size details um it's called Wikimedia

1266
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,000
cloud services and basically people can

1267
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,400
create VMS and we have like a you know a

1268
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
few other openstack things uh I don't

1269
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,680
know the exact reason why openstack was

1270
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,020
selected it was picked in like 2011

1271
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,540
2012. I do know that the main person who

1272
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,280
was hired for it was like a member of

1273
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
the openstack foundation contributing to

1274
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,480
openstack already but um I don't know

1275
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,160
why I'm happy to like put you in touch

1276
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,720
with the people who do know the answer

1277
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,460
or at least point you to the wiki pages

1278
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,020
that might contain the information if

1279
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,359
you want to find me afterwards

1280
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,540
thank you thank you
