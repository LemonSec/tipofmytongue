3
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
alrighty good afternoon everybody and

4
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,800
welcome to a new hope before we get

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
started i ask that you please silence

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
your cell phones as it does mess with

7
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
the av equipment and that you please

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
wear your mask fully over your nose and

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
mouth for the duration of your time

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,960
indoors on any of the new ho facilities

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
so vulnerability assessment assessments

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
have

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
a bunch of under the door tools latch

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,799
based attacks and climbing through vents

15
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,880
and around walls and fences but how well

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
does that actually hold up in the field

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
so this talk is going to focus on

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
successes and failures and lessons

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,799
learned so please welcome karen ing and

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,620
bill graden

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,170

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,518
[Applause]

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
oh there we go okay thank you all right

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
so welcome to lock bypass tricks in the

26
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,000
field

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
uh so

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
my name is karen i'm a physical red

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
teamer i am also one of the village

30
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
leads for the physical security village

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
we've done a lot of cons and i do not

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
need supervision when using a lathe

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
my name is bill graden i'm a physical

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
security researcher and do some red team

35
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
as well we're in a physical village and

36
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
um apparently i do need supervision

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
while using a lathe

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
those of you who've seen my previous

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
talks will be used to the beard that you

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
see on the screen

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
oh it is not on the screen

42
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
get the slides up

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
hey there we go there we go

44
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
so

45
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
you might have seen this

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
let's just turn this right off or take

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,239
this right off okay

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
so

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
you might have seen our bypass 101

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
sessions with the physical security

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
village formerly known as lock bypass

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,480
village in various cons

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
and so we're going to do a lightning

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,519
review of that for those who haven't

55
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
seen it but this talk is about adding a

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,599
little bit more to it it's about not

57
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,440
just those techniques but what works

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
what doesn't etc and so to do that we're

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
going to start off by giving a high

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760
level overview of the overarching goals

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
and objectives that we have as red

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
teamers and that's going to help us

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,720
frame our decisions when we're choosing

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
which uh which bypass to use

65
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
so the goal is to simulate a real

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
attacker right so we're going into

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
companies and we are helping them to

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
secure themselves so ultimately it's you

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
know helping out the blue team here and

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
so we want to do what a real attacker is

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,840
going to do

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
and part of that is keeping our bypasses

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
compatible with social engineering right

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,080
so a real attacker they don't want to do

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
something where if they get caught there

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
is no way out

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,319
sometimes they will but uh usually not

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,200
right so when we're doing

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
non-destructive type bypasses that's

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,799
something that we're keeping in mind is

81
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,599
what happens if someone walks up to us

82
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
and and catches us with whatever tools

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
whatever technique in in the middle of

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
that process

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
um and so we're going to use that as an

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
objective going through

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
we want to be fast

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,680
so

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
often

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
we're working with places that are a

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
little bit more secure and it's not a

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
matter of if we're going to get in but

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,599
when

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
and they know that and so they're going

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,599
to be trying to detect us early start

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
responding to us and ultimately

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
intercept us before we're successful

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,200
right so we don't want to spend 45

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
minutes doing a very tricky bypass

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,319
because that's going to give the

101
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
response for us 45 minutes to get there

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,599
and of course we don't want to get

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
detected as well we don't want it seen

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
don't get heard or set off any sensors

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
and so we'll be looking at the noise

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
level primarily of a lot of these

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
bypasses as well as what sorts of

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
sensors they will trip

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
another thing that

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
that we're going to do before we start

111
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
is analyze the possible paths of entry

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
there's always multiple ways to go there

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
are usually multiple ways to go and so

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
we're going to look at all of them right

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
so in this example facility here we've

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
got a couple different paths that the

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
intruder could take taking certain

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
amounts of time each having certain

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
amounts of visibility on the cameras

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
each and setting off sensors at

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
different points along the path and so

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,080
we're going to look at those look at the

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,759
hardware how long it's going to take to

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
bypass each door and move each distance

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
within each path and we're going to

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
tailor our red team to pick the

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,680
best case for us the red team which is

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
the worst case for the defender and that

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
way we're going to test and re-test

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
until the defender is secure on that

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
worst case path

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
and so that way they know if they're

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,400
going on the worst case they're going on

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
everything right so so we're going to

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
pick which path we take based on that

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
criterion

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
so when working with companies we often

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
do more of a white box type assessment

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
so they'll give us the floor plans ahead

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
of time

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
in a more realistic red teaming

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,199
environment or sometimes they want us to

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
do a black box and in that case we're

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
going to do some

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
some reconnaissance some intelligence

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
and figure out

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
as best we can what that internal layout

148
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
is going to look like and so two years

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
ago i gave a hope talk all about that

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
how to look at the outside of a building

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
and figure out based on that based on

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
the windows and massing etc what's on

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
the inside so if you're interested in

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
that process i encourage you to check

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
that out

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
so with that context in mind

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,960
karen's going to start running through

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,880
the options available to us

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
all right so

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
whoop i'm gonna jump right into it and

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
get started with last targeted bypass

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
otherwise known as poking

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
so i'm sure you guys have seen this

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,120
before poking karting it has a bunch of

165
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
names and what it does is it target gets

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
the latches that hold the door closed

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
and then depending on the orientation of

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
the latch you either shove or pull it

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
so here's an example of a door that we

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
found that has a very visible latch so

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
this is definitely one of the first

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,840
things that we would try on a door like

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
this and the tool itself there's a bunch

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
of tools you can use latch slips

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
travelers hooks plastic cards even a

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,199
well bent piece of wire works i have

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
this card here that i like to use

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,039
but before we can talk about that we're

179
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,960
going to talk about dead latches so what

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
i have circled here in red is dead latch

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
dead latches and what they do is

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
essentially prevent us from doing

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,479
exactly what i'm about to show you guys

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,680
that we can do

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,560
so

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
uh we have a video here but i can also

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
just live demo it but let's do the video

188
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,759
so you can see that the latch goes into

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,360
the door here but when the dead latch is

190
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
actuated pushed in then you can't

191
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
actually push in that latch so this

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
prevents us from being able to slip or

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
card the door luckily a lot of the times

194
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
the dead latch is not actuated and this

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
means that you can pretty much do

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
whatever you want so here's the

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
instructions real quick for pulling the

198
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
latch so the latch slip tool goes behind

199
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,919
the latch and you kind of wiggle it

200
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
until the latch goes into the door and

201
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,880
then without removing the tool from

202
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,319
holding in the latch you pull the door

203
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
open uh could i get a camera onto the

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,919
door sorry av folks

205
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,800
oh perfect thank you

206
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,919
oh boy

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,080
all right

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
but you kind of wiggle it back and forth

209
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,319
while pulling

210
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,719
and

211
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,370
[Applause]

212
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
and then if the latch is facing the

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
other direction you can shove it and

214
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
basically that's just shoving a card

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,080
between the latch and the strike plate

216
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
and then pulling the door open just like

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
i did

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
so here's a demo video of that

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
so you can see

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
the door is being locked here and you

221
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
can no longer open it

222
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
and then you take a clear plastic card

223
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
any card works really just has to be

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
kind of flexible and you just shove it

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
in between the door and it just opens so

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
nice and easy very quick bypass very

227
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,039
convenient

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
and here's us demoing it at vegas a

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
couple years ago we were staying at the

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
flamingo so we thought it'd be fun to

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,039
use our hotel room card to open it and i

232
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
mean it works so

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,640
all right next i'm going to be talking

234
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,720
about handle targeted bypass

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
so uh we're primarily going to be

236
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
talking about the under the door tool so

237
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
this allows us access into areas that

238
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
have properly functioning dead latches

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
and this instead of targeting the latch

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
targets the handle of the door it mimics

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
the person exiting from the other side

242
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
and it allows you to use a little bit of

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
wire with some string to open the door

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
so basically how this tool works is it

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
gets inserted under the door and it

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
maneuvers onto the handle of the door

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
and then you pull the string and that

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
pulls it down and then you can pull open

249
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
the door

250
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
so here's can you pop the screen back up

251
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
the wire we got was a little too stiff

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
for this tiny door so unfortunately we

253
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
don't have a live demo for that today

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
so here's the little video demo

255
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
so

256
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
here's our red teamer with the tool and

257
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
it goes underneath the door

258
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
up oop there it goes

259
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
you slide it onto the handle of the door

260
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
nice and easy

261
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
and then you can pull down on the string

262
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
and it'll open the door for you

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,079
there we go wow amazing

264
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,200
[Applause]

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
and then the other thing to note for

266
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
poking in the under the door tool is you

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
can use them in combination so if you

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,360
have

269
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
a lever handle that's kind of slippy so

270
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
it's easy for the tool to fall off of or

271
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
if you have something like a door knob

272
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
what you can do is you can use an under

273
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
the door tool or a door knob tool to

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
open it partially so that it deactivates

275
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,480
the dead latch and then you can poke it

276
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,680
and then you can open it the rest of the

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
way

278
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
next i'm going to be talking about crash

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,839
bars so i'm sure you guys have seen

280
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,399
these before these are crash bars they

281
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,320
have a large bar across the door and you

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
push that down and that's what unlocks

283
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
the door

284
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
and the tool for this is another piece

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
of cleverly bent wire it's similar to

286
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,440
the under the door tool and it uses some

287
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,000
string to actuate it and open the door

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,959
so

289
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
real quick instructions but i think a

290
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
video is going to be a little bit better

291
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
wow look it's me

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
so there goes the tool up the side of

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,199
the door

294
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
yay

295
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,760
all right next is pulling really hard so

296
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
surprisingly there's a lot of doors that

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,839
uh in particular external doors that are

298
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,040
loose in the frame and if you have a

299
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,519
strong enough arm you can just

300
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
pull it open even when it's locked

301
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
in particular you want to look for

302
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
springy and loosen the frame doors with

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
a little bit of flex in particular multi

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,959
bank doors are

305
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,480
vulnerable to this

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
and

307
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
here's the instructions real quick in

308
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
case you guys didn't figure it out

309
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
we could demo it on this door but it'll

310
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
pull the frame right off it's a yeah

311
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,959
it's a little small so but you'd be

312
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
surprised how often this actually does

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,560
work

314
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
all right uh back to the slides please

315
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
thank you av

316
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,360
next i'm going to be talking about

317
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,639
wheelchair buttons and request exit

318
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
sensors so wheelchair buttons are really

319
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
great accessibility feature they allow

320
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
the door to open itself pretty much when

321
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
the button is pushed

322
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
but sometimes it's installed in such a

323
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,639
way that it'll unlock the door and open

324
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,920
it even if the door is supposed to be

325
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,360
locked otherwise

326
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
so here's one that we found a while ago

327
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
so

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
the door is locked and we push

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
the wheelchair button there oh it's open

330
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,439
amazing

331
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
and then of course request exit sensors

332
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,880
so these are primarily installed for the

333
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,920
convenience of people leaving the

334
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
building and some are set up so that

335
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,519
it'll unlock automatically as you

336
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
approach from the inside and others tell

337
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
the controller hey someone's exiting

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
don't ring the alarm no one's forcing

339
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
the door from the other side so you want

340
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
to keep an eye out for these when you're

341
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,959
doing bypasses so that you don't trip an

342
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
alarm or do something like that

343
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,240
uh bill you want to talk about fire

344
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,760
alarms yeah so another thing that um

345
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,160
that folks are not necessarily aware of

346
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,040
is

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
when you've got a door that's in what's

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
called the access to exit so you need to

349
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,839
go through that door to get to an exit

350
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
it must by code unlock in a fire alarm

351
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
situation so looking at the floor plan

352
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
you can tell when that happens or if you

353
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
can see that there's no other way out

354
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
that's got to be what happens

355
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,279
and so

356
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,040
all you got to do then

357
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
is pull the alarm let's test if my live

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
on stage wiring worked

359
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,600
wow

360
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,050
and the door is open

361
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,920
[Applause]

362
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
there's no alarm

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
folks might not know but it's actually

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,519
very straightforward to reset these with

365
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,880
a flathead screwdriver up top of it

366
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
and there's just a switch on the inside

367
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
so when i flip this back

368
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
it is now back to normal operation and

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,680
that alarm starts going off

370
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
pop back to the slides

371
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,920
[Music]

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
right so for those who couldn't see

373
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,199
right flat head up top

374
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,160
there's just a switch on the inside

375
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
all right and next i'm going to be

376
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,839
talking about unlocked or improperly

377
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,959
locked doors

378
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
so if i could get the slides back up

379
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,959
thank you

380
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,079
so oh right the mic all right so there's

381
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
a lot of reasons why a door won't be

382
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
locked if you encounter one in the wild

383
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,519
so sometimes it can be human error so

384
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,959
things like someone propping it a staff

385
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
member forgetting to lock it properly or

386
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,720
if you yourself came by when the

387
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
building was open and propped it open

388
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
and nobody noticed that it was propped

389
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,839
it can also be unlocked due to

390
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
environmental issues so if there's an

391
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
air pressure difference between the

392
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
inside and the outside of the building

393
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
or if the door frame is warped so

394
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,320
especially during the summer door frames

395
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,519
kind of expand a little bit they get

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
sticky they don't close properly or if

397
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
the door closer doesn't work if the lock

398
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
is broken or if there's no lock there at

399
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,279
all

400
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,959
and of course you can go through

401
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,880
ceilings and windows and around the

402
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
obstacle

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
so here's some of us in vegas just a big

404
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
fence with barbed wire ooh real scary

405
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
and

406
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
easy peasy it's like a ladder you just

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
go over it

408
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
here's another example of a building

409
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,680
with false ceilings so we have a wall a

410
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
locked door and you can just

411
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
kind of go over it

412
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
so very conveniently there's a ladder

413
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
there that you can go over

414
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
not all fall ceilings will have a ladder

415
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
but this one happened to so if you're

416
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,519
able to like boost yourself up something

417
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,959
like that

418
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,560
and then you can just

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
disconnect the little

420
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
wires that hold the ceiling tile in

421
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
place and oh there he is

422
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,079
and then

423
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
and down he comes and now he has access

424
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,680
to a space that should otherwise be

425
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,199
locked out

426
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,480
another example of this is ladders so

427
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
some of you might have seen these before

428
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,279
there are ladders with these cages

429
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
around them and you'll notice at the

430
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,279
bottom here there's a panel that can

431
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
lock in place and this prevents people

432
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,759
from using the ladder perfect right

433
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,320
except there's a perfectly serviceable

434
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,839
ladder on the other

435
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,279
side so you can still get up onto access

436
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
of places that you shouldn't have access

437
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
to but

438
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
it is very openly

439
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
able to be accessed uh here's another

440
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,199
example oh no offense uh whatever will

441
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
we do

442
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,440
another ceiling tile this one looks like

443
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
it leads directly from the outside so

444
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
that's a very easy method of entry that

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
pretty much anyone without any skills or

446
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,160
training can just easily come into so

447
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
that's definitely something that we'd

448
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
want to point out

449
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
here's another one so there's a door and

450
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
right over it is a vent that leads to

451
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,120
the other side of the door

452
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
so you know these are things that you

453
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,320
think are kind of obvious and people

454
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,839
should know better but it is something

455
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
that we see very very commonly when

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
doing red team activities we'll see

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,360
people just not really thinking about it

458
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,959
because it's not really their job so

459
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,320
they don't consider the security

460
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
implications of the things that they're

461
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,519
setting up

462
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,040
uh you want to talk about purchasing and

463
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
examining hardware yep

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,559
so

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,079
you know we'll often encounter hardware

466
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,919
that we are familiar with

467
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
right so you know something you can use

468
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
poking the latch under door tool that

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
sort of thing but sometimes we deal with

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
stuff that is new and we got to find

471
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,079
some new ways to hack it and so when

472
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,599
it's hard we're not familiar with we're

473
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,280
usually going to borrow one from the

474
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,679
facility or purchase one and and try it

475
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
out and see what we can figure out so

476
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
one kind of fun example is we were doing

477
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
a case for loss prevention a few weeks

478
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
ago

479
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,679
and we had this um pilfer guard alarm

480
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,320
lock uh type setup so there you

481
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
sometimes see them under the two two

482
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
brand names but they're the same thing

483
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,120
um

484
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,559
and so we got one found a number of

485
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
things one is they tell you exactly

486
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,799
where to put the magnet

487
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
it says remove label after installation

488
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
the number of times we've seen these

489
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
that do not have that label removed is

490
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,000
uh is non-zero

491
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
and i guess i i actually should talk

492
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
about magnet bypass as well if you can

493
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
pop back to the door for a second

494
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
oh did i just pull our power

495
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
no good

496
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
right so

497
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
the way these are supposed to operate

498
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,240
is you tap your card mag brake unlocks

499
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
mic mic

500
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,799
it happens hard mag strike unlocks and

501
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
the door is open

502
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
if you do a bypass so from the other

503
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,679
side

504
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,039
there we go how's that

505
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
okay i'm gonna do my talking here

506
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
so if you do a bypass and

507
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,559
um

508
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
and and it detects that door is open

509
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
without the card read then it's gonna

510
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
alarm as we heard

511
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
so what we can do is

512
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
attack the detector so there is this

513
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
magnetic contact sensor in the side of

514
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
the door here

515
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
and in the frame there so this is a

516
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
magnet sorry in the side of the door and

517
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,720
the frame is the sensor that attacks

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
this magnet well we can put in a

519
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
surrogate magnet and replace the one in

520
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,679
the door

521
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
no alarm

522
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
and i remove the magnet

523
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
there we go

524
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,360
pop back to the slides

525
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
and my sincere apologies to the av folks

526
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,039
this talk must be a nightmare for you

527
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,160
so that's what we're talking about when

528
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
we say putting a surrogate magnet right

529
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,760
in between the arrows where it tells us

530
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
exactly where to put them

531
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,039
but there's other things you can do so

532
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
you got this lock up here that's meant

533
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
to unlock it and it hits

534
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,039
this piece of metal that flips this

535
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,960
switch and that's our locking and

536
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
unlocking mechanism

537
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,240
that corresponds to an indicator on the

538
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
other side that's just a mechanical

539
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,400
whether you see the red on this or not

540
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,760
and it tells you whether it's locked or

541
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
not

542
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,880
um so you know in theory if you could

543
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,240
find some way to poke through that

544
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,159
indicator you could actually push the

545
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
indicator until the switch goes but they

546
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,559
provide us these nice horizontally

547
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,679
oriented

548
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,240
vents for the sound to get out so you

549
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,159
just stick a lockpick in there and slide

550
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,280
it on over

551
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
right so pretty pretty simple brainless

552
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,200
thing to do and this is sort of thing

553
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
that i would not be surprised if

554
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
shoplifters out there have figured out

555
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
how to do with this particular model

556
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
right so that's something that that

557
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
we're going to do as well is buy it

558
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
examine it and see what we can find

559
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
and so now karen's going to chat about a

560
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
couple of the bypasses that we talk

561
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
about that aren't quite as useful and

562
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,720
the reasons why

563
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,159
all right so the first thing i'm going

564
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,440
to talk about in this section is

565
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
removing the hinges

566
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
so a lot of the times you'll

567
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,919
have a door and it's locked but the

568
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
easiest way to unlock it is just

569
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,159
not to unlock the door so some doors

570
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,520
you'll see the hinges are installed

571
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,960
backwards so they're accessible and you

572
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,559
can unscrew them and take them off of

573
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,840
the hinges

574
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,039
so you can just

575
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
unscrew the hinges

576
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,559
you can also remove the hinge pin so a

577
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,240
lot of the times you'll see doors with

578
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,200
the hinge pin exposed and the pin can be

579
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,799
removed pretty easily and allow the door

580
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
to come off the frame

581
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,159
so here's a little demo video because i

582
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,840
didn't want to bother with all the noise

583
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
live

584
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,159
but

585
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,880
here it goes but i mean you know whack

586
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
whack yeah so yeah it's it's a hammer

587
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,559
and a bunch of pins so you hear the

588
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,200
thump thump thump thump

589
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
and out comes the first pin

590
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
and then you can use it to take out the

591
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
second pin

592
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
video

593
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,919
and there's the door

594
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,240
yay

595
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
so this is limited utility because of a

596
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,120
few reasons first of all you know you

597
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,880
guys saw how long it took me to do it on

598
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
that mini door so it takes a lot of time

599
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,080
it makes a lot of noise so you know

600
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,840
you're going at it with a hammer so

601
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
someone here's

602
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,720
from the other room they're like oh what

603
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
is that so you know you're more likely

604
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
to get detected that way it can't be

605
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
stowed or aborted so if you're like

606
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
halfway through opening it and someone

607
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,679
comes by you can't really be like oh i

608
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,960
wasn't doing anything because the door's

609
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
halfway off of the frame

610
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
it's often not in the threat model so a

611
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
lot of the times you

612
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
well it'll be something that you point

613
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,159
out and it's not really in the threat

614
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,440
model it's just good to know that

615
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,679
someone could in theory do it

616
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,039
it's difficult to do without causing

617
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,360
damage so you know especially when it's

618
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
a big full-size door and you're kind of

619
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,799
maneuvering it and going at it with a

620
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
hammer it's you know likely to cause

621
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
some damage and of course the fire

622
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,039
marshal gets really mad about

623
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,799
removing doors from the hinges in

624
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,799
particular if it's a door that prevents

625
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
venting of the fire

626
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
and so if that's just wide open and you

627
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
leave it open then that can be kind of a

628
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,760
problem

629
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,080
another reason is because if you leave

630
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,919
the door wide open and just off the

631
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
hinges that can lead to a problem if

632
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
someone else happens to come in during

633
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,640
your red team engagement with malicious

634
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,960
intent and they can just go through the

635
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,679
store that you left on the side of the

636
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,520
yeah that's one of the

637
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
one of the things that we have to be

638
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
very careful about right when doing red

639
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
team engagements is that we're bypassing

640
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,559
stuff we're defeating various security

641
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
mechanisms we don't want to create that

642
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
perfect storm for a real criminal to

643
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
come in while we are operating take

644
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,039
advantage of the vulnerabilities we've

645
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,240
just created

646
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
and have the operations center think

647
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,919
that all the alarms they're setting off

648
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,320
are just us

649
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,840
so it is pretty limited utility if you

650
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,679
have an unmonitored head in the woods

651
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
and you need to get through then i guess

652
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,960
it's an option

653
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
uh also button push combination boxes

654
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
so i'm sure you guys have seen these

655
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,080
around they allow physical access to an

656
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
area without needing the actual key

657
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
itself there also exists these kinds of

658
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,279
boxes that you can push the buttons on

659
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
and you can put keys or fobs inside of

660
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
them

661
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,799
uh so here's one from was this one a

662
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
residential yeah yeah so you'll see

663
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,200
these a lot with like airbnbs things

664
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
like that or with a

665
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,960
restaurant and things like that along

666
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
the street if it's like an opening up

667
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,840
kind of thing they'll so that have the

668
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,480
external keys in there

669
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
and the other thing is they'll put fobs

670
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,159
in there for apartments and condos and

671
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,279
things like that if you're running an

672
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,159
airbnb and these boxes often are not

673
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
shielded so if you have a little prox

674
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,520
mark a little fob duplicator there it's

675
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,240
very easy to just hold it up to the

676
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
unshielded box and just duplicate a fob

677
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
without even needing to touch it

678
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,559
for these boxes and these simplexes you

679
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
can also use uv ink and powder so you

680
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
can apply these to the buttons and you

681
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
can figure out which buttons are being

682
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
used and then from there you can brute

683
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,400
force the combination

684
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,360
sometimes you don't even need uv ink at

685
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
all to figure out what the combination

686
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,840
is if it's worn down enough

687
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,679
the other thing is simplex locks the

688
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,679
default code from the factory is two and

689
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
four at the same time and three and

690
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,960
so many people do not change from the

691
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,080
default

692
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,039
so we've seen tons and tons of places

693
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,600
where the simplex lock is the default

694
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
factory combination and

695
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
this is very easy to look up anyone can

696
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
find this information online so it's

697
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
definitely something that you want to

698
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,279
change given the opportunity to

699
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,880
however a lot of these can be limited

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,320
utilities in particular using uv ink so

701
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,080
it's kind of a cool trick to show people

702
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
but it's also very limited in how we can

703
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120
use it it requires multiple accesses so

704
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,679
if this is an internal door you need to

705
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
get in there put the uv ink on the

706
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
buttons and then come back a couple days

707
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,080
later when it's been used to see what's

708
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,039
been

709
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,039
wiped off by use

710
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,120
it can also require multiple accesses if

711
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,200
somebody goes in and just

712
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,799
wipes the buttons off

713
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,640
and then you have to start over

714
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
it's pretty easy to detect you know

715
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,720
anyone can bring a little flashlight and

716
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,640
just see if there's ink on the buttons

717
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
it's not reliable and it's often not in

718
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
the threat model it's not something that

719
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
a lot of companies that hire us are

720
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
worried about uh the only time that

721
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,080
we've really seen it useful as like part

722
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,000
of the threat model is if it's like an

723
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
insider threat so if they're worried

724
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,000
about somebody with access to that door

725
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
escalating their privileges when they're

726
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,840
not supposed to

727
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,039
be uh next i'm going to pass it on to

728
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,559
bill who's going to talk about bypass

729
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,520
and social engineering

730
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
right so as i mentioned at the start

731
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
when we're picking bypass techniques we

732
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,679
have to be careful that it's going to be

733
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,360
compatible with what a real attacker

734
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
would do and so as a red team one of our

735
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,360
goals is you know if we get caught we

736
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
want to be able to try to continue that

737
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,159
pretext try to explain it away and and

738
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,840
see if we can get out of it to test the

739
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,919
facility's response and we've seen some

740
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
pretty poor responses you know they they

741
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,279
catch us with with a giant under the

742
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,039
door tool and uh

743
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,720
and and don't don't know what it is and

744
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
eventually we're able to talk our way

745
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,120
out of it right so that's a valuable

746
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,200
thing that we can report back on

747
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
but ideally we don't want to do that

748
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,240
right so

749
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,399
things like these long under door tools

750
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,600
we're generally going to roll them up

751
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,200
and stow them away as soon as we're done

752
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
with them any of these wire contraptions

753
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,120
we want to make sure that ideally we

754
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,399
don't get seen with them because that

755
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,840
makes social engineering your way out

756
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,959
just a whole lot harder

757
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,919
this is the opposite end of the spectrum

758
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,760
right so they use these little little

759
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
shove tools that are used to uh to slip

760
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
the latch out of the way and they are

761
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,799
perfect

762
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,640
so you know you're you're walking up to

763
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
the door you're sticking that near the

764
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
keyhole and it happens in a relatively

765
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,559
in a couple seconds so

766
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,240
the motion from a distance looks like

767
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
you're just using a key and you're

768
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,039
opening that door and you're authorized

769
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
to go in right so this is perfect for

770
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,799
all of those reasons it also doesn't

771
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
create much noise and so you know time

772
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
noise what it looks like this is a good

773
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
one to use

774
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
and so we will use this technique

775
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,240
anywhere we possibly can

776
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,159
we want to look at the environmental

777
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,520
design of the site and try to find

778
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,559
places that if we're going to do

779
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,880
bypasses we're a little bit more

780
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
uh more protected from from guards

781
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,760
rounds from noise etc so this is a fun

782
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,679
example we found of a mechanical room

783
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,799
and there's lots of things that you can

784
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
do once you're in there

785
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,480
and that mechanical room is inside of a

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,440
locked single-use bathroom stall so

787
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
we go on in and we're just taking a poop

788
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,039
don't mind all the metal scratching

789
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,158
noises just taking a poop

790
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
and uh and we've got all the time we

791
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,200
need and all the privacy we need to do

792
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
whatever we got to do to get through

793
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
that door

794
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
right and so you know you might have

795
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,880
heard of cpt crime prevention through

796
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,480
environmental design right so on the red

797
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,559
team side we're obviously using that on

798
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,240
the flip side so trying to find places

799
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
that's not got great lighting that's

800
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,679
covered with hedges etc that gives us a

801
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,200
little bit of privacy to do these

802
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,399
bypasses undetected

803
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
and so of course

804
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
we don't want to be bringing the whole

805
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,720
kitchen sink all right so we're going to

806
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
try to keep our tool kit to as slim as

807
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
we can and that's why scouting out the

808
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,399
facility first and knowing what you're

809
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
going to encounter is very important

810
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
there

811
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
and so for most we're going to use just

812
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,159
like a a messenger bag laptop bag type

813
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,640
of thing whatever would be at home in

814
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,720
that facility or under the pretext that

815
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
we're doing right and so sometimes our

816
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,480
pretext is just we're the facilities

817
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
locksmiths

818
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,080
and that works a lot

819
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,399
but

820
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,840
if we can't do that then we're going to

821
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
do something like this

822
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
right and of course tailgating big big

823
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,000
problem i mean this is you know we talk

824
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
about bypasses a lot but tailgating is

825
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
the biggest problem most businesses have

826
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
right and so if we get all of our bypass

827
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
gear for getting through the inner doors

828
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,440
nice and tucked away so we look like we

829
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,039
belong there it makes it way easier to

830
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,000
tailgate in that front door

831
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
another thing that we're going to look

832
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,279
at is getting access later so it's not

833
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,080
nearly as flashy as some of the bypasses

834
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,799
but it is still very useful and it's

835
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,600
extremely much in your threat model

836
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,520
so um

837
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,919
things like megs or meg locks if you can

838
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,000
get in during say building open hours

839
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,240
you open it up put some gaff tape on or

840
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
a sticker or a piece of paper or two

841
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
because these maglocks have a magnetic

842
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,840
holding force and that holding force

843
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
falls off with distance squared which

844
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
means that when it's right against

845
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
itself

846
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,440
is it cubed right cubed yeah because of

847
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
the because it's a dipole right thank

848
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
you

849
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
um so folds up with distance cubed um

850
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,559
so when it's right against itself you

851
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,799
got 2 500 pounds of holding force if you

852
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,799
put just two two thin pieces of paper in

853
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
there it's now down to 50 pounds so

854
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,440
it feels like it's locked it's got 50

855
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
pounds of force but you can push that

856
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,559
open and so give yourself access later

857
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,440
um you can also put in a little rock or

858
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
something in the base there prevent the

859
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,279
door from closing properly and

860
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,799
often people will then exit and not

861
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,000
realize that that's what's happening

862
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,679
he'd come in later

863
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,120
and you can even do things like put your

864
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,679
foot on the door and flex the bottom out

865
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,600
and create enough space to put something

866
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,799
in there

867
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,399
and so this door is still locked but

868
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
then when someone exits or enters that

869
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,200
door

870
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,279
that that little rock is now there and

871
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
the door's not going to fully close and

872
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,000
you've now got yourself access

873
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
you can also put something into the

874
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,200
latch hole and that prevents the latch

875
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
from fully engaging and allows you to

876
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,039
slip it when the dead latch might

877
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,279
otherwise be engaged and sometimes it's

878
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
hard to make this work but you can

879
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,000
put

880
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
you know a little piece of foam into a

881
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,519
plastic bag squish it down so it stays

882
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,840
squished and maneuver that in there

883
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,679
while the door is fully locked and then

884
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,840
the bag leaks and it expands out and

885
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,600
it'll then give you access later

886
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,000
so that's sort of um

887
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the one one other general technique that

888
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,679
we'll use and now we just got a bunch of

889
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,200
random stories and whatnot that we'll

890
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
run through

891
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
yeah so

892
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
you know one of the things that's kind

893
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
of important when we're talking about a

894
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,960
threat response is the actual

895
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
sensors for the

896
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
response but also the response of the

897
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,600
people itself so we'll have times when

898
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,519
we'll have an alarm that will set off

899
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,000
and you can prop the door and just leave

900
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,679
come back in an hour you know keep an

901
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,960
eye on it and then we've often had times

902
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
when

903
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
nobody shows up

904
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,440
so you'll have this door it's alarmed

905
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,679
and a lot of the times if the door is

906
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,360
prone to false alarms things like that

907
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
if it's like a windy day something like

908
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,559
that you know security's like oh there's

909
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,559
the alarm again and they just ignore it

910
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,320
they shut it off or they disconnect the

911
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
alarm all together and

912
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
this means your door looks alarmed but

913
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,640
it easily allows access into your

914
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
facility

915
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,159
another example of this is we've had

916
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,399
facilities where the response time is so

917
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,640
abysmal so it takes them 45 minutes to

918
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,720
an hour to actually respond to an alarm

919
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
being tripped and 45 minutes to an hour

920
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
is a lot of time that's enough time to

921
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,600
get into a facility do whatever mal

922
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760
intent that you need to get done and get

923
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,159
out before anybody shows up to

924
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,760
apprehend you

925
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
anything to add to that

926
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
yeah i mean i guess the other thing is

927
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
the the response is often woefully

928
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
inadequate right we bypass in we set off

929
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
an alarm we close the door the response

930
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,679
force shows up 10 15 30 minutes later

931
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,279
they pull on the door yep door's secure

932
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,440
it's not not unlocked or anything and if

933
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
it's such a huge facility i mean they

934
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,399
don't know where to check

935
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
um so they just check the door secure

936
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,600
and then go away um so yeah there's a

937
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,120
lot of a lot of problems with the

938
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,640
responding force that really renders

939
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
these alarms less useful than they could

940
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,640
be

941
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
yeah so another uh another funny example

942
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,600
we saw wandering around new york city uh

943
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
earlier this week um is you'll often see

944
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
cages like this that have the push bar

945
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,080
style doors there are bypasses for those

946
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,000
without the cage and uh i encourage you

947
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
to check out the not so civil engineers

948
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
youtube channel he's got some great

949
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,040
videos on that but when there is a cage

950
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,359
he can stick a tool in and push that

951
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,679
push button from the other side or stick

952
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,199
in a piece of string and pull it tight

953
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,440
and that'll pull the push bar

954
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
so we saw this

955
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
this interesting method to prevent that

956
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,000
from happening right so they got it

957
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
recessed right in it makes it very

958
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,879
difficult to get a tool that's going to

959
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,560
reach all the way around and do that and

960
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,918
a string is of course not going to work

961
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
at all

962
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,399
the problem with that is if we walk over

963
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,759
to the lock side well there's the latch

964
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,719
and

965
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,119
this building not anything particularly

966
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,159
important just the

967
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
okay

968
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,239
for those who are not familiar this is

969
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
one of the main att switch buildings for

970
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,879
the eastern seaboard it is also uh was

971
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,200
used by the nsa for many years known as

972
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,880
titan point for listening on all of your

973
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
phone conversations so you know a little

974
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
bit a bit important there that it not

975
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,160
get broken into to be fair we didn't go

976
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,760
in that would be crossing an ethical and

977
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
illegal line so we don't know what's

978
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,119
beyond that door maybe it's just the

979
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,040
garbage compactor we don't know right

980
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,480
and maybe their threat model here was

981
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,000
just transients getting in and sleeping

982
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,839
there in which case you know what if

983
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,200
they were doing that string technique

984
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
and this fixed it that's fine right so

985
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
we don't know right not not not reagan

986
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
on them well the other thing with this

987
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,800
door is the bars were kind of spaced

988
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,440
apart so if the blockage wasn't there

989
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
you could just stick your arm through

990
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,560
and push down the push bar as well yeah

991
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,520
yeah lots of ways

992
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,680
so another thing that we're going to

993
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,760
look at when we're actually doing uh

994
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,680
doing consulting jobs is things like

995
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,599
four spell entry right so door like this

996
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,440
you see the two strike holes there one's

997
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
for dead bolt one's for the latch you're

998
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
gonna have to bypass both of those

999
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that's gonna take you five ten minutes

1000
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,079
but i mean look at that jam you know i

1001
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,320
mean it's half inch veneer right a swift

1002
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
kick to that and you're in in half a

1003
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,000
second right so obviously we're not

1004
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
going to be doing that um on a site

1005
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
unless it's authorized which usually

1006
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
isn't but uh we're going to let them

1007
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,760
know like this takes us 15 minutes to

1008
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
bypass but by the way like your real

1009
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,240
problem here is forcible entry

1010
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,680
when we see something like this right so

1011
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
a conduit that's been built to send a

1012
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
contact sensor through the concrete into

1013
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,359
the door frame but that conduit is

1014
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,359
obviously empty so we see that we know

1015
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,560
that there's no alarm here even though

1016
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
there could be

1017
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,839
and then some funny remediations so

1018
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,920
using a strike plate to protect the dead

1019
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,400
latch that's not real or the deadbolt

1020
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
sorry that's not really what you need to

1021
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,119
protect you need to protect this down

1022
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,200
here

1023
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
and with uh with gates uh so we often

1024
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
see these that uh the hasps that you put

1025
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
the padlock on and they're just bolted

1026
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,040
on

1027
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
so

1028
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,800
it's still locked that lock is still on

1029
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,119
there in it

1030
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,079
and um and often doors just get propped

1031
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,800
open right so notice please keep this

1032
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,240
door closed okay well apparently not so

1033
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,359
when you know when we're looking for

1034
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,560
doors that might be left open those

1035
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
signs that say please keep this door

1036
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
closed well they're the first ones we're

1037
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,680
going to go to

1038
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,200
right and

1039
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
also depending on the conditions right

1040
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
so as the red teamers we choose when we

1041
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,079
attack right so if we attack during a

1042
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,240
power outage or when the cooling system

1043
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,079
is out on a very hot day when there's

1044
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,599
just been a leak and whatnot right so

1045
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,920
for instance um on one occasion we saw a

1046
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,839
server room that was propped open to

1047
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,200
have the fan

1048
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
blowing into it because the cooling

1049
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,640
system was out and there was just a leak

1050
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,560
in there right and so if we know that

1051
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,440
that sort of thing's going to be

1052
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
happening

1053
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
that that often leaves things propped it

1054
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,800
necessarily shouldn't be

1055
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
we'll often see

1056
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
interchangeable core deadbolts removed

1057
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,400
or not deadbolts interchangeable cores

1058
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
removed and so people think okay well

1059
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,320
there's no longer a keyhole there no one

1060
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
can get in well that means anyone can

1061
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,320
get in with a flathead screwdriver and

1062
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,680
you no longer have the lock in the way

1063
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
to prevent you from actuating that

1064
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,880
mechanism in the back so we see this a

1065
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,200
lot and it basically means that door is

1066
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,960
unlocked

1067
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
right and of course the cables as well

1068
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
last year i have a whole other talk uh

1069
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,079
defcon on what you can do if these

1070
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
cables are exposed but in this case you

1071
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,400
can just unplug it disable that camera

1072
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
and um do that right so a lot of this is

1073
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,839
just sort of having that hackerish

1074
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,079
mindset and applying it in a red team

1075
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,480
context

1076
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,000
so with that i'd like to thank you for

1077
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,119
listening we'd like to take any

1078
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,190
questions

1079
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:34,840
[Applause]

1080
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,960
if you guys have questions

1081
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
is the song good

1082
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,119
uh i noticed you

1083
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,119
uh in your almost last slide talked

1084
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,320
about interchangeable core

1085
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,400
often there are construction cylinders

1086
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,280
in these also which are keyed alike and

1087
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
the other thing that people few people

1088
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
know about ic

1089
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,359
is that with a single instance of a lock

1090
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,520
you can make a control key

1091
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,079
which removes all the other cores

1092
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,320
replaces them with one of your own so

1093
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,720
you can go in and be perfectly safe

1094
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,000
inside in the secure area so i often in

1095
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,119
my tests

1096
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,040
try to exploit ic

1097
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,440
technology and they're you know often

1098
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
padlocks somewhere in the perimeter

1099
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,760
they're on the same system and you can

1100
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,359
just take one

1101
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,839
and reverse engineer it

1102
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,839
yeah that's a great point and we sort of

1103
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,520
kept this talk to bypasses instead of

1104
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,200
keying system attacks

1105
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,280
um for those who are interested in what

1106
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
the gentleman just mentioned

1107
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,000
um

1108
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,720
i've got a talk at defcon 28 so two

1109
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,040
years ago the safe mode all about that

1110
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,960
exact sort of thing right so how to get

1111
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
the control from uh taking apart ic

1112
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,400
cores we've got a nasty echo here um and

1113
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
how to dis or how to reverse engineer

1114
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,560
mastery systems etc so all that sort of

1115
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
thing if you're interested in it i

1116
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,359
encourage you to check out my defcon 28

1117
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,440
talk another thing you didn't talk about

1118
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,319
is

1119
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
what happens when somebody responds and

1120
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,800
you're detected

1121
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,319
you know often you have a get out of

1122
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,240
jail card that says

1123
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,079
doing an authorized security test call

1124
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,839
this number and what do they do they

1125
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,520
call the number on your get out of jail

1126
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,720
card

1127
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,880
instant fail

1128
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,200
yeah and we we usually don't run with

1129
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,760
that actually we often go with facility

1130
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,480
contacts being with us we just found it

1131
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,560
works so much better it avoids problems

1132
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,599
like the iowa courthouse case um and you

1133
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,200
know the facilities internal security

1134
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,839
team they are usually so pumped to come

1135
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,920
with us on a red team engagement and

1136
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,240
learn what we're doing and you know they

1137
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
get better training than we could ever

1138
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,520
give them in a controlled environment

1139
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,359
when doing that so so we're usually

1140
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,599
going to do that instead of using the

1141
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,680
the letter of authorization we will also

1142
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,839
get that letter of authorization in case

1143
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,960
we get separated because we don't want

1144
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,599
to take that risk but great point

1145
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,400
yeah another reason why facilities

1146
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,680
really likes being with us when we're

1147
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,200
doing engagements is

1148
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
it's a lot more convincing for

1149
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,359
corporates to fund better security

1150
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,280
practices within the company so you know

1151
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
if they can give like a firsthand

1152
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,760
account of all the things that they saw

1153
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,280
all the bypasses how quickly we're able

1154
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,680
to do things then they're a lot more

1155
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
likely to be able to convince corporate

1156
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,440
to spend that money on fixes and things

1157
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,760
like that

1158
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:32,800
hi

1159
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
cameras and motion sensors how much uh

1160
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,400
do most enterprises feel that they're

1161
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,079
safe because of those they're like well

1162
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,680
i mean our locks might be whatever but

1163
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,200
like we've got cameras up there and

1164
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,119
someone's watching those right how do

1165
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,800
you convince them

1166
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,079
i mean is it just through going through

1167
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,760
this process and saying well we got in

1168
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
and you didn't see us or what's the

1169
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,920
conversation look like on that side

1170
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
it's a great question and it depends on

1171
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,599
the threat model and the business model

1172
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,520
right so we

1173
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,200
you know we're ultimately protecting our

1174
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,160
clients businesses and their operation

1175
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
the facility is a tool for that but the

1176
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,720
facility is not the end goal so many

1177
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,440
businesses they choose to transfer that

1178
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,040
risk and get insurance rather than

1179
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,800
taking on the risk head-on and hardening

1180
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,960
their facility right so in that case if

1181
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
they've got a camera that will show

1182
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,000
after the fact what happened and allow

1183
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,839
them to make that insurance claim they

1184
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,599
are good with that and if they're

1185
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
protecting just assets and not data

1186
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
that's a perfectly acceptable thing to

1187
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,760
do so sometimes that's okay right but

1188
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,040
you got to take it from a risk-based

1189
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,319
perspective and if they're protecting

1190
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,160
data where it would be catastrophic and

1191
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,680
you can't just insurance your way out of

1192
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
that that's uh that's something where

1193
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,359
we're going to be uh be having that

1194
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
conversation so yeah you know we're

1195
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,359
going to take it from a business risk

1196
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,280
and um and business continuity

1197
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,839
perspective and and look at it that way

1198
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,680
and then of course the analysis that uh

1199
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,359
i showed right at the beginning

1200
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,520
so for cameras and motion sensors right

1201
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
so you know we're showing where all the

1202
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,040
cameras can see where all the motion

1203
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,440
sensors can see we are plotting that out

1204
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,359
very rigorously and showing them exactly

1205
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,520
how someone can get in and so that just

1206
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
provides a little bit of uh of

1207
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
scientific method to back up what we're

1208
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
saying

1209
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,960
yeah and the other thing to consider

1210
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,040
with cameras is that

1211
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
conditions may vary so a camera that can

1212
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,800
see perfectly well during the day might

1213
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
not be able to see the back of a not

1214
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,040
well-lit parking lot at night during a

1215
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,800
storm when it's windy something like

1216
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,119
that you know so there's a lot of things

1217
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,880
that like you can't entirely rely on a

1218
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
camera to

1219
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,000
take care of and then on top of that is

1220
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
the response so even if someone shows up

1221
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
on that screen will the response be

1222
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
appropriate and will it be timely you

1223
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
know if your response to seeing somebody

1224
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
on the camera is going there and seeing

1225
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,480
if they're still there well if it takes

1226
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,920
you 15 minutes to get there and they're

1227
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,680
gone oh well i guess there's nothing we

1228
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
can do right so you know that's there's

1229
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,079
a lot of things to consider to look at

1230
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,640
security as like a whole unit rather

1231
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
than just oh these little details are

1232
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,640
fine we don't need to worry about them

1233
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,079
so you need to consider all of these

1234
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,520
aspects of you know your security

1235
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
yeah it's a tricky problem right and so

1236
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,599
we we could do a whole other day-long

1237
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,280
talk on running a security operations

1238
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
center and how you're going to actually

1239
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,560
look at that footage and figure out

1240
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,119
where to send your response team

1241
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,640
but so that was a long-winded answer but

1242
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,200
great question

1243
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,880
do you have any memorable anecdotes you

1244
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,319
could share about getting caught and

1245
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,560
either successfully or unsuccessfully

1246
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,680
talking your way out of it

1247
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,040
so we have to be a little bit more

1248
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,400
general in what we share because we're

1249
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,960
nd8 on everything

1250
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,760
but

1251
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,599
yeah i mean most of the time when we're

1252
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,359
caught by

1253
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,319
um

1254
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,960
you know maintenance and and caretaking

1255
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
and whatnot when we're going in after

1256
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,880
hours because we're often doing that

1257
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,079
um

1258
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,480
it's you know we're we'll often pretend

1259
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,680
to be their supervisor um or or an osha

1260
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,079
inspector or something like that and you

1261
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,400
know you just have that body language

1262
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,800
and don't even say a word right and and

1263
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
there's been all kinds of studies on

1264
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,920
this right you know that first quarter

1265
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
second of interacting with someone and

1266
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,200
you've made up your mind on who that

1267
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,160
person is and whether they're

1268
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,920
trustworthy and whatnot right so you

1269
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,760
have that body language you you don't

1270
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,079
pretend like oh i just got caught

1271
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,000
you know you you act like okay i'm i'm

1272
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,920
your boss all right tell you justify to

1273
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,480
me while you're here and uh

1274
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,160
and that works very effectively right

1275
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,599
and then during the daytime we're doing

1276
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,599
more social engineering type of of

1277
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,280
working with the folks that are actually

1278
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,440
on scene in that case we're going to be

1279
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
the maintenance staff or the locksmith

1280
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,960
or we're going to be pretending to just

1281
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,240
work there and in a big company that

1282
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
works and so when people call us out on

1283
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
it in that case

1284
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
if they have a process it generally

1285
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,119
works fairly well

1286
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,400
and if they don't then we're going to

1287
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,680
advise them on how to build out that

1288
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,119
process so that they can actually

1289
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,800
authenticate visitors and determine that

1290
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,319
no we don't work here we're not supposed

1291
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,520
to be here

1292
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,000
yeah and we've definitely had occasions

1293
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
where we'd be in a space that

1294
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,440
you know

1295
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,520
the public shouldn't have access to and

1296
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,800
a maintenance person will come in and

1297
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,280
start explaining to us why they're there

1298
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
so you know they'll be like oh i'm here

1299
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,720
to fix this and it's like okay you okay

1300
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,800
go ahead and we'll tell them to go ahead

1301
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,640
and they'll be none the wiser as well

1302
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
i have a question from the matrix chat

1303
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,400
david asks what pretext have you used

1304
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
when getting caught with for example a

1305
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,560
giant under-the-door tool

1306
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,480
the line of saying you're the locksmiths

1307
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,319
doesn't seem like it would work

1308
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,119
yep so in that case we didn't even need

1309
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,960
to use a pretext

1310
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,440
um because we could tell that

1311
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,119
you know this was this was someone

1312
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,040
working late

1313
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,000
busy

1314
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,640
stressed out he did not want to deal

1315
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,760
with us

1316
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,480
so you know we just apologized and got

1317
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,280
out of his way and he shot us a sideways

1318
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,119
look and and he was on his way so that's

1319
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,800
the one time that we were caught

1320
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,200
with that when we couldn't um make

1321
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,480
ourselves out to be locksmiths or

1322
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,240
whatnot um and so you know it depends on

1323
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,680
on the facility of the security culture

1324
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,520
but unfortunately you often don't need

1325
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,040
to pull out your pretext right body

1326
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,599
language is all and um and they'll move

1327
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,680
on

1328
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,160
you talk about alarms getting turned off

1329
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,880
when they ring too much have you ever

1330
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,040
like set off alarms until somebody just

1331
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,759
turns them off

1332
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,920
so it's the sort of thing that we advise

1333
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,280
clients on

1334
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,920
constantly because i mean sometimes it's

1335
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,200
a malicious actor that's setting them

1336
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,680
off often it's just the wind or animals

1337
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,720
um

1338
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,680
but

1339
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,480
we we don't do it super super often

1340
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,119
because it's just a pain in the butt for

1341
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,920
the customer and and it does degrade

1342
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,200
their security and we don't want to be

1343
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,000
doing that um so you know what we'll do

1344
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,680
is we'll we'll do testing right so we

1345
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,359
will test a single time and determine if

1346
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,200
they've gotten to that point and we will

1347
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,640
build up their security operations

1348
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,319
centers policies and procedures to make

1349
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,319
sure that they handle that effectively

1350
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,000
um but we we usually try not to actually

1351
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
attempt that sort of thing because it's

1352
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,520
just it's just a pain for the client

1353
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,680
hey uh i was curious have you ever seen

1354
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,839
anyone deal with tailgating effectively

1355
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,599
and i ask that because i work for a mega

1356
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,319
corp and i travel to all our offices and

1357
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,760
it's almost always quick for me to just

1358
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,599
kind of mill around and get myself in

1359
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,960
and deal with security and whatnot

1360
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,920
tailgating is a tough problem you know

1361
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,000
especially for for workplaces that want

1362
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,400
to maintain a bit of a more open culture

1363
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,240
so you don't have those like giant turn

1364
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,240
styles and whatnot um the half height um

1365
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,599
gates right like the gates you have on

1366
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,000
the subway you know so those you can hop

1367
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,079
over them but those in combination with

1368
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,599
someone at reception who's going to see

1369
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,119
you hop over or whoever you're

1370
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,800
tailgating behind right so a full height

1371
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,960
door is going to see a hop over those

1372
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,119
are very effective um there's a great

1373
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,119
scene in mr robot on how those might not

1374
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,319
be effective um but you know it it gets

1375
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,440
you down um significantly in terms of

1376
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,040
tailgaters being able to get in

1377
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
tailgating is a huge problem right and

1378
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,839
so

1379
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,480
we we advise generally segmenting your

1380
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,319
physical space right so the place that

1381
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,079
most employees have access and you can

1382
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,839
tailgate into you should not have

1383
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,760
anything important there the only thing

1384
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,920
you should lose if an intruder gets in

1385
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,160
is maybe a couple encrypted laptops

1386
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,480
right just monetary value and nothing

1387
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,319
irreplaceable and then your server room

1388
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,839
and whatnot you're going to have a

1389
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,440
little bit more beefy security on that

1390
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,480
man traps work yeah they're costly and

1391
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,240
they're they're a big impediment to

1392
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,640
employee movement they're you know a lot

1393
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,079
a lot of employers don't like having

1394
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,680
that culture with the man traps in there

1395
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,680
so you know they're good for where

1396
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,760
they're necessary but um it's often not

1397
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,200
the right solution

1398
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,598
yeah and

1399
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,960
oh yeah sorry um so the the question was

1400
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,800
man traps work and the

1401
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,240
um and what what is the man trapped

1402
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,359
right so it is a a turn style or a turn

1403
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,079
style type door or two doors where

1404
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,920
you go in the first one it locks behind

1405
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,520
you you are now stuck between those two

1406
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
doors and if you don't have the

1407
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,359
credential to get through

1408
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,839
you are stuck in there until a guard

1409
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,280
comes and can verify who you are um and

1410
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,839
so obviously you need a very robust

1411
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,520
human response situation for that to be

1412
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,599
okayed by the fire marshal

1413
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,920
you know it's a a pretty

1414
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
disruptive option and an expensive

1415
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
option

1416
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,160
yeah

1417
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,079
a lot of times we find

1418
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,079
you know the best thing for the company

1419
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,440
is just to have a better security

1420
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,440
culture so you know calling out people

1421
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,040
that you don't recognize that are

1422
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,559
walking around in a space that you know

1423
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,480
should be restricted you know not

1424
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,920
letting people tailgate and you know

1425
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,760
it's easier said than done but it's very

1426
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,119
important to promote that security

1427
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,839
culture within the workspace and you

1428
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,240
know don't be afraid to kind of call

1429
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,680
someone out if you see someone doing

1430
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,040
something that they shouldn't be you

1431
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,599
know a lot of the times we will see

1432
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,119
you know people that'll kind of side-eye

1433
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,240
us when we're

1434
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,640
on a test but they won't do anything

1435
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,400
they won't call it in they won't stop us

1436
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,240
and ask where we're going they won't do

1437
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,359
anything they'll just kind of be like oh

1438
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,640
that's weird and keep going about their

1439
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,720
day so it's really important to have

1440
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,640
that security culture and not be afraid

1441
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,880
to be like hey are you supposed to be

1442
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,000
here

1443
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,520
so i'd say that's kind of one of the

1444
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,960
bigger things for like social

1445
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,480
engineering and whatnot

1446
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,359
yeah

1447
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,760
you mentioned um exit sensors i wanted

1448
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,599
to hear more about that it seems like a

1449
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,680
good candidate for a bypass but like

1450
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,960
when you slip a piece of paper to

1451
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,480
trigger him or something but you said it

1452
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,800
seems like there's also a concern there

1453
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,640
yep um so

1454
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,440
yeah request to exit sensors right so

1455
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
when the door opens and you've badged in

1456
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,839
that's a normal entry no alarm when

1457
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,200
you're exiting there's going to be some

1458
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,119
sort of sensor a button or a passive

1459
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,800
infrared sensor to detect that someone's

1460
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,040
exiting and cause that to not alarm as

1461
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,000
well

1462
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,839
um so passive infrared is by far the

1463
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,680
most common and you might have seen the

1464
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,119
canned air attack that you can do with

1465
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,800
those

1466
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,520
that's difficult to pull off when you

1467
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,640
don't have

1468
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,160
a double door so you can go in the side

1469
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,760
right near it when you're down at the

1470
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,839
ground it's usually too far but with

1471
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,720
more

1472
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,359
fluid um it is something that's doable

1473
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,599
so you know request to exit sensors yeah

1474
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,720
they're uh

1475
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,920
they're

1476
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,839
definitely something that can be hacked

1477
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,240
there there's some solutions right like

1478
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,960
interlogic interlogix makes a dual

1479
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,480
technology one that also has range

1480
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,079
control radar and so it makes it a whole

1481
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,000
lot harder to trip out interlogix

1482
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,520
unfortunately just went out of business

1483
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,559
so

1484
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,240
one of our favorite recommended upgrades

1485
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,960
is getting harder to do um right but

1486
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
another option that you can implement is

1487
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
a badge in badge out system with pass

1488
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,760
back detection right and so that way you

1489
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,240
know that um if someone's exiting you're

1490
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,440
controlling that on your access

1491
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,040
controller as well and there's no more

1492
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,839
any

1493
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,640
request access sensor to hack

1494
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,960
yeah and another thing that we do with a

1495
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,920
lot of clients is tuning the sensor so

1496
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,000
sometimes the sensor will be too

1497
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,760
sensitive and if it's in an area where a

1498
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,440
lot of people walk past you can just

1499
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,960
open the locked door without needing to

1500
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,000
really do anything because there's

1501
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,319
people walking close enough on the other

1502
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,520
side of the door

1503
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,040
so you know you want to tune it so that

1504
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,640
it only detects people exiting but you

1505
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,400
don't want it to be tuned in such a way

1506
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,920
that it doesn't detect the people and

1507
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,839
sets off a false alarm as well so it's

1508
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,599
kind of a balancing game there as well

1509
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,839
yeah it's a big cause of false alarms

1510
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,119
yeah

1511
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,559
there's so many moving parts with these

1512
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,480
systems right so much that can go wrong

1513
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,559
you really need

1514
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,960
some full-time staff for a big facility

1515
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,319
right that their their whole job is

1516
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,000
making sure these are staying up to two

1517
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,520
and keeping them maintained yeah and

1518
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,440
especially in like a larger facility you

1519
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,559
have so many of these stores and so you

1520
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,640
need like a really big team because

1521
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,960
you know even if one door is slightly

1522
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,440
out of the way and a little bit off well

1523
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,119
that's a huge vulnerability that people

1524
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,839
can get in through

1525
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,760
so we're getting the stop sign from our

1526
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,240
lovely mc so thank you very much folks

1527
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,670
it was a pleasure taking your questions

1528
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,200
[Applause]

1529
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,520
also uh if you guys want to come check

1530
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,119
out the door in person we'll probably be

1531
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,480
in the hardware hacking area after this

1532
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,000
with all this stuff so you guys can come

1533
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
play around with it do whatever you want

1534
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,280
yeah thank you guys

1535
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,400
and thank you to both of them for such
