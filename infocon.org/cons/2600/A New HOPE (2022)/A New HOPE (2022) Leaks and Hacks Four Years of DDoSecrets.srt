67
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
four years overview of distributed

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
announced secrets ddos secrets

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
as people said we organized in 2018

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
using the royal we i wasn't involved at

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
the start um emma best co-founded it

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
with the architect and some other folks

73
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,000
and started publishing data

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
that came from hacks and leaks were our

75
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
two main categories at the time

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
some of the first data sets was

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
 fbi fridays an anonymous hack

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,120
and

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,000
that month december 2018 wikileaks cited

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,879
us in a lawsuit

81
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
we also

82
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
started a category called limited

83
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
distribution which

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,600
instead of the main releases that we

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
publish via torrent and

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
publicly limited distribution is our

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
category for

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,639
if you think of us as a library limbus

89
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
is our reserved books section and you

90
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
have to be a researcher or somebody who

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
publishes in order to access this data

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
the first data set and that

93
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
category was a tumblr hack

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
which folks may remember

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
and we also published our first russian

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
data set that month it was the cyber

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
anakin releases

98
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
and we published our insurance file

99
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,520
2019 january we published a much larger

100
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
collection of russian data called the

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,360
dark side of the kremlin

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
more than 100 gigabytes of data from

103
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
several different hacks collected and

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
published

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
on

106
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
our site

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
we also started working the next month

108
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,360
with

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
unicorn riot to capture identity europa

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
discord logs

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
uh discord was a platform that was

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,320
hosting a lot of far-right and fascist

113
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
organizing and still does

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
we also started publishing

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
data under the state sponsorship label

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
we like to be up front about our sources

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,320
when we know that they're

118
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
state-sponsored the first data

119
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
in this category was

120
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
uh maxine popoff's files

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
this was a russian contractor who

122
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
infiltrated anonymous if you want to

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
find out more about

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,960
this

125
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
and then go to emma best and zan north's

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
talk at defcon next month because they

127
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
will talk about that

128
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,239
among other things

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
in june that year was the first time

130
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,919
that we noticed that twitter was

131
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,160
censoring some of our urls after a

132
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
threat analysis company included us on

133
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
their blacklist

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
we were later removed from this

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
blacklist but

136
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
this will be relevant later we also

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
published the first data that came from

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
a ransomware origin

139
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,319
perceptix breach was a breach of

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,759
perceptics

141
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
surveillance company that was a vendor

142
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
to several law enforcement agencies and

143
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
federal government

144
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
license plate reader i believe

145
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
they lost their contract with the

146
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,199
federal government after this hack

147
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,240
uh

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
we also started in september that year

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
the banker's box section which is our

150
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
name for data that comes from the

151
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,919
financial services industries from tax

152
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,720
havens from

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,240

154
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
shell companies yeah those sorts of

155
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,240
entities that are often hard to get data

156
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
from

157
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
the biggest hack in the bankers box

158
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
section was published

159
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,840
in november one month two months later

160
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,160

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,880
was phineas launched the hacktivist bug

166
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,039
bounty because in addition to extracting

167
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,520
data from the bank they extracted a

168
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
hundred thousand dollars and they

169
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
launched a bug bounty for other

170
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
that we use to cross-reference and index

175
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
some of these data sets

176
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,240
it's named after the fbi cryptonium for

177
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
ht lingual which is the cia's mail

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
opening program because a lot of the

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
data that goes into hunter is emailed

180
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,479
we published then uh the 29 leagues

181
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
number 29 leaks

182
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
data set which is from one of these

183
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
shell company creation

184
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
companies in the uk

185
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
and we published this with the occrp the

186
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
organized crime and corruption reporting

187
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
project there was an embargo with a

188
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,599
bunch of journalists and a lot of

189
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
stories came out at once

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
december that year we published military

191
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
with cipa chilean

192
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,879
military

193
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,199
email inboxes

194
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
and

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
relevant because in march

196
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,159
the source for mili colleagues mata

197
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
pacos was the first

198
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,279
person awarded a hacktivist bug bounty

199
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,000
by phineas fisher both phineas and mata

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
pagos confirmed this for us they got ten

201
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
thousand dollars

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
um

203
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
february 2020 the united states new

204
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
national counterintelligence strategy

205
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,320
lists hacktivists leaktivists and public

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
disclosure organizations as significant

207
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,399
threats

208
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
we don't think that we're a significant

209
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,680
threat but we did like the word leaked

210
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,359
vests so we kind of took it on

211
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
may tax evader radar our first

212
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
collaboration with a journalism school

213
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,839
to dig into the bahamas corporate

214
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,560
registry and we put out a tool for

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
transcribing the bahamas corporate

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
registry and

217
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,920
stories came out from the european

218
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,599
investigative collaborations

219
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
consortium of newsrooms

220
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
der spiegel in felipe

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
then

222
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
the attorney general of the bahamas

223
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
announced the leak investigation naming

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,959
me and emma best as

225
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,600
persons of interest

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
and june 2020 we released blue leaks

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,760
which is 269 gigabytes from u.s law

228
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
enforcement fusion centers training

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
centers

230
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
and this made a big splash twitter

231
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
banned our url after we released blue

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,760
leaks

233
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
also kicked us off of the platform

234
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
um

235
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,880
we've not been back but it did free us

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,959
up and give us a lot of time since we

237
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
weren't tweeting so we registered as a

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
non-profit

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
in july of that year and we're now a

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
non-profit

241
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,689
[Applause]

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
december we announced an affiliation

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
with the harvard institute of

244
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,240
quantitative social sciences they have a

245
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
secure drop and sources can use that to

246
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
send us data if they want to send to a

247
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
secure drop

248
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
it hasn't been used very much but

249
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
that's just because we get a lot of data

250
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
that's larger than what fits in a secure

251
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
drop

252
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,600
forbidden stories

253
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
started using blue league's forbidden

254
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,800
stories there's another network of

255
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
journalists that do cross-border

256
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
collaborative investigative

257
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
work they specifically focus on

258
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
stories that

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
are causing journalists to be either

260
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
threatened or murdered so they used blue

261
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
leaks to report on cartels

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
in mexico and business with fentanyl in

263
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
china

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
january 6 2021

265
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
we announced our ransomware category

266
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
this was sort of overshadowed by stuff

267
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
that happened later in january 6

268
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
but

269
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,959
the ransomware category was our way to

270
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,519
collect data that ransomware groups are

271
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,279
publishing to their own leak sites on

272
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,640
the tor network

273
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,360
and we will not grab everything but the

274
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
data sets that

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,760
people

276
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
are interested in or that we are

277
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
interested in we scrape them from

278
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
ransomware

279
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
to our network sites and add them to our

280
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,959
archive

281
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,320
we published i believe it was one

282
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
terabyte of data from ransomware

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
on january 6th

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,399
and then there was a coup attempt in

285
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,760
washington

286
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,639
and

287
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,680
we

288
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
announced that we would prioritize data

289
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
that came

290
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,519
and taught us about this coup attempt

291
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
so shortly thereafter we received the

292
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,240
largest data set that we have

293
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
been offered to that point it was 32

294
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
terabytes of video

295
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,839
and posts from parlor that was

296
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,519
um captured by donkey mb

297
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
and we made it available on aws which

298
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
was what had kicked parlor off

299
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
because it's hard to transmit 32

300
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
terabytes of data

301
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
uh

302
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,839
we also received the

303
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,079
donald dot win network

304
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
post from the social media analysis

305
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,279
toolkit

306
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
and both of these data sets were cited

307
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
in the impeachment trial

308
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
shortly thereafter the second

309
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
impeachment trial

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
also that month pang

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
artist collective in germany put up some

312
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,399
billboards outside the headquarters

313
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
of biontech inviting

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
workers at biontech to leak the formula

315
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
for the pfizer vaccine and we don't

316
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
typically solicit leaks but if people

317
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
want to put our url on their billboard

318
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
and invite people to submit leaks to us

319
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
then we are open to that

320
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
march there was another coup this one in

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,240
myanmar we received 330 gigabytes of

322
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
financial data from the myanmar coup

323
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
regime

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
military structure and

325
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
learned a lot about that

326
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,360
i'm probably going to skip some

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
gab leaks give sengo

328
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
jones day

329
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,279
april of

330
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
2021 we started publishing um jones day

331
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,199
which was

332
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
another data set in the ransomware

333
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
category we added it to the limited

334
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
distribution first and then

335
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,519
freddie will talk more about that

336
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,519
process of finding what could be

337
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
publicly released

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
may we published mpd leaks from the

339
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
metropolitan police department another

340
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,959
ransomware

341
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,680
um from the book ransomware group and

342
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,120
including transcripts of the

343
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
negotiations between babbook and the mpd

344
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
for deciding how much their data was

345
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
worth or not

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
september oathkeepers

347
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
next february um

348
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
we got

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
data from gibson go the christian

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,959
fundraising

351
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,839
site tied to the freedom convoy

352
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
fundraiser in ottawa that shut down

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,040
canada and some border crossings

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,680
two terabytes of data from mining

355
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,800
secrets

356
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
published with forbidden stories because

357
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,519
a journalist was threatened

358
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,000
and imprisoned in guatemala reporting on

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
a mine so we got these two terabytes

360
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
from the mining company and published it

361
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,279
with this consortium

362
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,880
and the most recent

363
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
and the subject of our talk

364
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,040
uh

365
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
ostensibly is the russian data that we

366
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,800
started publishing since the russian

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
invasion of ukraine i think the count is

368
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
more than 10 million documents and every

369
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,760
email counts as a document but there's

370
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
sometimes attachments so there's more

371
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
than 10 million documents

372
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,040
of a series of hacks more than five

373
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
terabytes emma

374
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
will have a better count of that

375
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
brings us up to today gq leagues naru

376
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,639
leagues police from naru the

377
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,120
detention center that australia uses to

378
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
offshore their asylum seekers

379
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
and gq leaks is from equatorial guinea

380
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,959
another very difficult government to get

381
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,959
information out of and

382
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,440
published with diario rombe have been

383
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,720
doing a great job and i'll talk about

384
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
them later as well

385
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
for slides yeah i don't know

386
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,480
well it's there's a usb secure okay okay

387
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,519
we're gonna try slides one more time and

388
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,040
we'll see

389
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
i'm gonna switch the laptops if that's

390
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,199
okay

391
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,079
[Music]

392
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,079
lots of clanking up here um so

393
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
does that work

394
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
no okay i'll just talk um so what does

395
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,600
ddos publish um it's actually uh lorex

396
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
did a great job of describing all of the

397
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,320
data sets that we have published to date

398
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
but there's a lot of stuff that we don't

399
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
publish or stuff that we will only

400
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
publish to academics newsrooms um

401
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,240
limited distribution for that

402
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,160
um from that point of view and it's

403
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,680
actually not that easy of a job to do

404
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
um part of the reason and part of what

405
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,039
we do as board as the advisory board um

406
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,319
is to have those discussions so um when

407
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,039
lorax was talking about the russian uh

408
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
data sets that were being leaked as part

409
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
of the ongoing invasion of ukraine

410
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,280
that actually sparked quite a bit of

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,359
conversation within the news

412
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,848
within the collective

413
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,319
[Music]

414
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
broadly speaking

415
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,440
any data set that's in the public

416
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
interest that you know advances the

417
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,799
public right to know about what's

418
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
happening in the world will release

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,640
um but it gets complicated when uh

420
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
you know

421
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
you have a armed conflict that's

422
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,039
changing every single day

423
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
you have data that's being released you

424
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
don't know who's giving it to you much

425
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
less for what reasons

426
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,039
and then there's also complications

427
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,000
because

428
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,280
uh

429
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
the normal sort of

430
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,880
don't hack these targets we're going to

431
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
look the other way if if you go after

432
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
russian military targets in a way that

433
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
we wouldn't do it outside of a war um

434
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
that kind of hint nudge thing that

435
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
happens um

436
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,200
that was happening around the world and

437
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,679
it's still happening uh that creates a

438
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720
lot of complicated questions obviously

439
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
we're not in the business of

440
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
advancing u.s military interests

441
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,880
and so

442
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
uh

443
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,320
you know that that's challenging at the

444
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
same time

445
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,400
we were getting data sets such as

446
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
there's one about i think it's the

447
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,320
russian ministry of culture is what they

448
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
call themselves but it really is the

449
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,480
censorship arm of the russian government

450
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
which will tell you uh that that news

451
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,840
site

452
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,720
is russian censorship yeah and so if

453
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
that makes our its way into our lap and

454
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
it falls off of a truck i i don't think

455
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
that we can

456
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
possibly say we shouldn't release it um

457
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,640
and and we did um

458
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
so those are the kinds of things that we

459
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,240
have to sort of think through and talk

460
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,960
about um because it's it's

461
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,799
it's obviously a lot more complicated

462
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
than just you know going to some onion

463
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,919
service and just grabbing all the files

464
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,120
um

465
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,760
in fact there's a slide here uh but if

466
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
you're interested npr did a story it's

467
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
just a very short piece about how and

468
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
it's just titled how a nonprofit group

469
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
became the largest depository for hacked

470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
russian data

471
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
and

472
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,559
one of the things that we talked about

473
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
was really how do you go through the

474
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
data in a way that's tangible and

475
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,640
understandable um when i talked to the

476
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
to the reporter jenna mclaughlin i sort

477
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
of described to her the difference

478
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
between getting like an amazon package

479
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,559
and you know you open it and you get

480
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,039
your stuff versus like the actual

481
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
warehouse that the data you know that

482
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
the package comes from like that's the

483
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
level of

484
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,080
difference of what one human can can go

485
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
through versus you know terabytes and

486
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
terabytes of data

487
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,799
especially when you don't you know

488
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,160
understand the language you don't

489
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
understand the cultural context you

490
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
don't understand um

491
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
the slang that people are using and all

492
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
that sort of stuff so um

493
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,480
so yeah so so it is complicated um

494
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
but i think you know there's a reason we

495
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,159
we like to work with leak data um

496
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,159
first it's fun it's it's a lot like a

497
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
loot box right you really never like

498
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
sometimes we wake up and you're like

499
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
wait we got what um

500
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
and so you never know what's going to

501
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,120
come in through the front door um and

502
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
it's really interesting we've we've

503
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
gotten everything from you know

504
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,720
mining companies to tax havens like that

505
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,520
that's great fun um but it also

506
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
is the situation where

507
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,400
a lot of the traditional avenues for

508
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
getting information about what's

509
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
happening in the in in the public are

510
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,080
just like fundamentally broken right

511
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
like if if you talk to anyone who is an

512
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,840
advocate for the freedom of information

513
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
act of which i include myself

514
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,960
um it's not uncommon for us to

515
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
complain about years of delay excessive

516
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,760
redactions things like that right

517
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
tools that should be in the public's

518
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
interest and the way of we of

519
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
understanding you know what our

520
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
government our government is up to and

521
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
other governments are up to

522
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
um

523
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,600
just don't work for the public

524
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
um so that's quite limiting even when

525
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
you um

526
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,320
talk to uh whistleblowers right who step

527
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,840
forward and

528
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
and

529
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
you know sometimes take

530
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,919
huge courageous um risks uh to inform

531
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,039
the public

532
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,120
you know it's often one person's view

533
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
and sometimes they come forward for

534
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
complicated reasons right um and so

535
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
to get a full like view of what's

536
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
happening in an organization or in in a

537
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
data set it's it's

538
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
sometimes these uh these data releases

539
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
will have way more and way more points

540
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,799
of view that um can tell a fuller story

541
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,600
in ways that one person um

542
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
sort of can't or

543
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
you know

544
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
anyway

545
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
uh so so you know those are some of the

546
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
motivations just to um to working with

547
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,400
leaked data um

548
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,479
[Music]

549
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,720
yeah so um but there are challenges um

550
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,960
you can't see it it would be a slide of

551
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,679
city hall but that's okay um

552
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
lorex talked about a data set that we

553
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,320
got from jones day jones day is one of

554
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
the largest

555
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
law firms in chicago or sorry in the

556
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
country and they have offices in chicago

557
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,000
but they're they're a huge law firm

558
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,679
right and so a lot of the work that they

559
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
do is

560
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
privileged legally and the public would

561
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
never see it even

562
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
even like other lawyers who are you know

563
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
litigation against jones they might get

564
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
some of their data but not you know a

565
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
full picture

566
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
um so jones day got ransomware because

567
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
some of the groups that that were

568
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,440
working

569
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
um

570
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
in response

571
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
all right let me start the story over uh

572
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
the chicago police department is

573
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
notoriously corrupt um and racist

574
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
and as a response to one of the one of

575
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,280
their botched raids uh jones day was

576
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,200
sort of brought in to review what had

577
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,919
happened um by city hall and so they had

578
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
all this data that then got ransomware

579
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
and dumped that we collected and and

580
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,360
found

581
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
um so that's the jones a data set and

582
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,440
that's sort of the genesis of it and we

583
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
were looking through it and we couldn't

584
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
really figure out um

585
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
what's the public interest in all of

586
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
this information

587
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
especially since it's like city halls

588
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,400
like emails and things like that

589
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
and then about a year ago a year plus uh

590
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
the police um

591
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
murdered a

592
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,559
young person um adam toledo

593
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,559
in the little village neighborhood of

594
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,840
chicago

595
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
um

596
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,039
so for context i grew up in the little

597
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,840
village neighborhood of chicago um and i

598
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,679
know every

599
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,760
you know i know quite a bit of report

600
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
quite a few reporters in chicago and uh

601
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
was sort of working with ddos quite

602
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
deeply so uh we started looking at the

603
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
data and what we realized is that this

604
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,440
kind of stuff that you would normally

605
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,840
get through a foia release like i've

606
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,400
i've sued so the city of chicago so many

607
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
times that i've lost track of it but the

608
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,799
the kinds of details that were in these

609
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,440
emails you would never get through foia

610
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
you would never get through discovery

611
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
you would never get any other way than

612
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,480
through ransomware

613
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,000
so following the police murder of adam

614
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
until later we released this this data

615
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,440
set and

616
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
i started working with newsrooms that i

617
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
knew personally

618
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
um to

619
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
go through it and pull out

620
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,559
information that we thought was relevant

621
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,840
we found things like

622
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,880
um uh

623
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
emails about environmental racism we

624
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
found emails about

625
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
the police response to the uprisings in

626
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,960
june of 2020

627
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
we found we found like

628
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
chases car chases right yeah policy

629
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,919
around not yeah

630
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
the police will just like go on car

631
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
chases and like

632
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
half of the time they were crashing like

633
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
killing people killing people right and

634
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,159
they had emails saying like you need to

635
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,679
stop this people are dying and

636
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
they didn't they this went out for years

637
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,799
right

638
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,200
um the mayor canceled her subscription

639
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
to the chicago tribune because she

640
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,559
didn't like their reporting yeah

641
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,240
so so lots of stuff that you would never

642
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,320
see right um and and that kind of like

643
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
investigative reporting was only made

644
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
possible through like the work of ddos

645
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,320
um

646
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,279
similarly when when we released the

647
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,320
information about parlor um

648
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
you know i think it was a very surreal

649
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,559
moment where i think i tell the story i

650
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,600
was going through the airport and cnn is

651
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
on and they have

652
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,279
like videos and videos and videos of

653
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
like hand-to-hand combat between police

654
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
and writers

655
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
in in the capitol building and you have

656
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,679
the posts people being like we did that

657
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,320
or i did that or pepper sprayed and i'm

658
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,400
still fighting um

659
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
and see you know being able to see that

660
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,039
sort of

661
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,480
um

662
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
it was weird right because like

663
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,279
on one hand the government governments

664
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
around the world are like calling us

665
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
like luctivists and significant threats

666
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
and wanting to open investigations into

667
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
the group

668
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,240
and at the same time you had like u.s

669
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,559
representatives on the floor

670
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,120
impeaching the president

671
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,200
using our data sets um as evidence

672
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
and then that's sort of being broadcast

673
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,279
across the world and i happened to watch

674
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,600
it at the airport i thought i was like

675
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,400
well what what what the did we do

676
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,440
um

677
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
so anyway so yeah

678
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
you know these kinds of data sets um

679
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,320
have so many different like tentacles of

680
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
like where things can go

681
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
uh that sort of like a traditional

682
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
investigation using like foia projects

683
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
just don't have so

684
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,640
um

685
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
so yeah i just wanted to highlight those

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
two data releases um

687
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,760
and well i can't see this more we have

688
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
more releases coming soon maybe we can

689
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,080
try the video

690
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,200
back there oh is emma emma on

691
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,880
hmm

692
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,000
hold on hold on

693
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
i know how computers work

694
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
i don't

695
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,559
that's the division of labor yes

696
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,080
i don't know how computers work

697
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,320
i did go to journalism school though so

698
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,679
i can talk to them yeah it's like the

699
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,200
ultimate irony is that like we can

700
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,279
release like terabytes and terabytes of

701
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
data we can't get the slides to work

702
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,399
um okay i think there we go yeah

703
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,679
[Applause]

704
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,200
yeah and so we have more releases coming

705
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,159
soon uh here's a little a little teaser

706
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,360
trailer

707
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,600
there we go

708
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:42,240
[Music]

709
00:28:44,710 --> 00:29:01,360
[Music]

710
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,279
i forgot to mention guacamaya was the

711
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,480
source for mining secrets so

712
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,399
this is

713
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,720
something to look forward to yeah

714
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,880
um let me see here oh sorry full screen

715
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,720
um

716
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,039
uh so lessons learned uh emma do you

717
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
wanna talk about some of the lessons

718
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
we've learned especially working with

719
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
newsrooms about going through these

720
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,840
large data sets

721
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
sorry could you say that again

722
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,799
do you want to talk about some of the

723
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
lessons we've learned working with

724
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,840
newsrooms

725
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,600
about these like really large data sets

726
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,480
and some of the challenges

727
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,410
sure um

728
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,559
[Music]

729
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,480
biggest lesson would be that most

730
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
newsrooms are really not equipped to go

731
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,439
through these these kinds of data sets

732
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,080
they haven't invested or prepared to

733
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
work with these kinds of data sets

734
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,520
and

735
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,919
the number one question we get from them

736
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,360
is

737
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,760
what do we do with these things what is

738
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,480
the story

739
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,200
and frustratingly they usually want

740
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
everything handed to them in a neat

741
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,559
little bow

742
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,200
uh which unfortunately is not what we do

743
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,919
we

744
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,679
present the data we will sometimes

745
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,919
highlight data points

746
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,320
but um

747
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,559
oh that's the

748
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,640
sorry the slide confused me i was like

749
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,200
are you on the wrong screen

750
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
um

751
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,399
uh

752
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,320
yeah we'll sometimes present data points

753
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
but it's up to

754
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
individual journalists and newsrooms on

755
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
how to interpret that and what to do

756
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
with it

757
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
because otherwise we just have way too

758
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,960
much of a say in

759
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
how

760
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,640
huge swaths of data are presented and

761
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,919
interpreted

762
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
and also it

763
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,120
presumes that we are or can be experts

764
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,279
in everything which is absolutely

765
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
ludicrous

766
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,840
and really one of the things that we do

767
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,720
is rely on journalists to be experts in

768
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,360
what they report on their subject matter

769
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,640
their local beats and when they do that

770
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
it works really well that's one of the

771
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,799
things that we're seeing with gq leaks

772
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
we're helping them process the data a

773
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,399
little bit yes

774
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,960
but we're trusting them to report on it

775
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
and they're doing a fantastic job of it

776
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,559
far better than we ever could

777
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,799
but the biggest issue that most

778
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,640
journalists have is that they're just

779
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,039
not prepared to look at this stuff

780
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,279
and they don't know where to start and

781
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,279
the newsrooms aren't giving them the

782
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,039
proper training or technical support

783
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,440
yeah um

784
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
yeah and and it's really frustrating too

785
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,559
because um one of the challenges is you

786
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,880
know when you like look through like a

787
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,080
40 terabyte uh data set for example

788
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
um actually let me give you the the blue

789
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,519
leaks example um it was

790
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,399
almost 250 gigabytes of data

791
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,760
stored it was like a php app with with a

792
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
database that had gotten sort of um

793
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,360
dumped and then what the what the fusion

794
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
centers would do is

795
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,159
every day they would send each other

796
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,039
like

797
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,880
updates which were then getting put into

798
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,440
an excel file um which were referencing

799
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,399
reports that were pdfs in the files

800
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,720
and that's just like how the data was

801
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
structured and so when we were you know

802
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,120
working with reporters on on blue leaks

803
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,559
investigations

804
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,559
um they would want to know like hey

805
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
what's happening in my backyard and then

806
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
you know we would give them the blue

807
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,240
leaks data and they're like i can't do

808
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
anything with this and then you have to

809
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,880
like sort of

810
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
understand the data enough to walk them

811
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,039
through it so that they can do their

812
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,640
analysis

813
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
um

814
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
but like

815
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
the reason that i you know we were able

816
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,159
to do that is because someone has the

817
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,039
capacity to go through and sort of

818
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,159
document

819
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,200
this

820
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
shitty php app that got hacked and then

821
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
the database that is attached to it in

822
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,559
the excel files

823
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,640
but like who has the capability to do

824
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,880
that and and one of the things that kind

825
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,799
of is frustrating

826
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,360
um what drama talks about is like

827
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
like a lot of people don't have either

828
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,240
the time the energy or most importantly

829
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,960
the editorial buy-in um to just go

830
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
disappear for you know

831
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,720
uh a month or two and then come back

832
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,279
with a story um often what we get is

833
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,039
what's the interesting stuff that's in

834
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,200
this data release and

835
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,039
you know i could tell you things that

836
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,399
are interesting to me but that doesn't

837
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,200
mean

838
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
it's the story that you want to tell

839
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,320
your audience or that it actually is

840
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,039
true or verifiable or anything like that

841
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,399
can i jump in

842
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,000
yeah i mean journalists

843
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,720
often request like data to be embargoed

844
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,200
to them for their exclusive use so that

845
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,559
they can get a time to look into it and

846
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,720
we have a bias to publish

847
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,440
to everyone and to not form these sorts

848
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,320
of

849
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,960
agreements that are

850
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,279
limiting the research that can be done

851
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
because we don't believe that any one

852
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,159
newsroom

853
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,800
should have um exclusivity

854
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,119
on a data set

855
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,040
so that's i know that there's like a

856
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,239
conflict and there's a

857
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
cross purposes at times with journalists

858
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,239
wanting to sell and monetize the

859
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,879
information that they have access to

860
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,399
models that we

861
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,280
are aware of existing

862
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,960
and pre-dis precede us are along these

863
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,800
lines the icij

864
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,399
um

865
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,040
the intercept to some degree

866
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,239
do

867
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,079
this thing where they keep exclusive

868
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,159
access to a data set and then

869
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,719
slowly dribble out stories and we're

870
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,320
sort of a different model but other

871
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,679
people can do it differently you know

872
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,240
like that's a lesson that we want to be

873
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,560
the takeaway from this talk is that

874
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,320
um folks should try it and do more

875
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,960
because we do want to not be the only

876
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,040
people doing this in this space

877
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,079
um

878
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,640
yeah so maybe we can go to questions

879
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,400
i think we have time for questions i did

880
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,480
want to mention one final thing

881
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
one final thing yeah we have two

882
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,200
questions

883
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
uh i wanted to go back to the beginning

884
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,280
who is ddos uh there's a few of us

885
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,800
and then there are

886
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
non-uh furry animals but this is the

887
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
important part and this is who we are

888
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,900
um

889
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,040
[Music]

890
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,079
so yeah

891
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,200
um

892
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
i think yeah then we'll just jump to

893
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,720
questions and then uh if we don't have

894
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
time for your questions we're going to

895
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
uh

896
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,400
plan

897
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
there if people want to go to the mic to

898
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
make sure your questions will be around

899
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,700
obviously for the rest of the conference

900
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,520
[Music]

901
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
we should just leave the animals up

902
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
right like one of them but which

903
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,240
we'll do a poll all right

904
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,560
what

905
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
maybe that's more race all right

906
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,280
all right we'll take questions now i

907
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,280
guess

908
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,920
see one question maybe

909
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,119
yeah

910
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,320
well hey i was just sitting in front of

911
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,720
you guys but i do have a question great

912
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
so i understand the frustration with

913
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
collecting this data

914
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,400
and then delivering it even with the

915
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
high points and having someone say so

916
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,040
now what have you thought about adding a

917
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,359
an analytical kind of wing to the

918
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,920
organization to address that to to sort

919
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,599
of package it up with that pretty bow

920
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,320
and hand it off

921
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
yeah i mean the thing that we've found

922
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
even with

923
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
for example gq leaks is a data set that

924
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,240
has been really work worked really well

925
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
which we released to a newsroom with an

926
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,119
expertise in equatorial guinea like

927
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,760
and they have a list of like names and

928
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,839
everyone that is

929
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,000
either in the power structure connected

930
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
to the power structure

931
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,760
uh family

932
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,400
this sort of institutional knowledge

933
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,480
it's very difficult to develop for every

934
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,640
single entity that we might get a leak

935
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,000
from

936
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,240
[Music]

937
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
and yet there are folks out there

938
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,920
obviously who have a lot of knowledge

939
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
about

940
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,640
the russian

941
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,119
nuclear program which is one leak that

942
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,079
we got the russian nuclear entity

943
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,839
so

944
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,599
emma does a lot of the initial analysis

945
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,720
and

946
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,599
is great and

947
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,440
i wish that we could have 10

948
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
emmas

949
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
and yeah we're always looking for more

950
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,880
energy and ideas we're going to add the

951
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,280
search engine again because we lost this

952
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,040
when our server was seized after blue

953
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,400
leaks which helps folks to just throw in

954
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,880
a keyword and find which data set it

955
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,000
might be in

956
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,200
this

957
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,079
empowers a lot of folks newsrooms who

958
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,880
might not have the capacity to

959
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,240
search to run searches on their end

960
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,040
but yeah there's always room for more

961
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,400
energy

962
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,560
next question

963
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
hi thank you great talk glad you got

964
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,680
your slides fixed

965
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,800
if you could flip through them really

966
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
fast again that would be great a

967
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,920
question i have for you is i'm a i'm a

968
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,240
fan of 2600 i'm a writer for 2600 i do a

969
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
lot of community stuff i also like

970
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,839
analyzing breaches and looking at stuff

971
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,880
i've looked at some of the stuff you

972
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
guys have done i've been really great

973
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,320
and so my question is

974
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
how do we get access to more of it even

975
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,680
if i'm not like a big journalist working

976
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,520
for a big media outlet and whatnot

977
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
because there's certainly some other

978
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
stuff on there that's really interesting

979
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,160
that i'd like to play with or look at

980
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
for example one of my research projects

981
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
was analyzing and correlating data

982
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,839
between the opm breaches and

983
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,760
ashley madison and some really

984
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,200
interesting data points that come out of

985
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
that

986
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,680
so much so that i was specifically told

987
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,839
at work to stop the research so with

988
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,119
that being said

989
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,040
i do like looking at some of this stuff

990
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,200
how does a normal person like 2600

991
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,280
writer get it get access to some of this

992
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,119
and i think ashley madison is in our

993
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,560
limited distribution i already got that

994
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
one yeah

995
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,640
yeah

996
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,760
and

997
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
you don't have to be a journalist or an

998
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,640
academic researcher to request access to

999
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,560
our limited distribution data

1000
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,359
send us an email with links to research

1001
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,480
that you have published wherever 2600 or

1002
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,000
your own blog like we'll read it and

1003
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,560
see if your request is genuine or

1004
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,320
if you're actually publishing research

1005
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,880
to the public that's a big plus and like

1006
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
is that a requirement to publish

1007
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
research to the public for

1008
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,359
yeah we we get a lot of requests from

1009
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,800
like

1010
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
i'm a private investigator and i want

1011
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,040
your data so that i can like sell it to

1012
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
my clients and we don't usually

1013
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,520
prioritize those of course yeah but we

1014
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,079
do we do work with um academics we do

1015
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,400
work with individuals we do work with

1016
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,480
reporters it's actually much broader

1017
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,280
than we kind of focused our talk on um

1018
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
you know

1019
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
typically

1020
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
you know it's like

1021
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
our

1022
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,040
our collective is fairly um

1023
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,960
we try to be very open um and and work

1024
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,520
in a very horizontal manner so

1025
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
you you know sometimes we'll have other

1026
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
members say

1027
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,800
here's a person that i know that is

1028
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
trustworthy was with this data that i

1029
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,119
know is limited distribution but

1030
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,560
i know that they're a researcher working

1031
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,160
on interesting things

1032
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,880
um and they could use access and so you

1033
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,200
know that also happens quite frequently

1034
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,960
so it's not impossible i've messaged you

1035
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,160
guys a few times and it's worked and

1036
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,839
then a couple times i got nothing so

1037
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,400
that's why i asked you know okay yeah

1038
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
i also will point out that most of us

1039
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
are volunteers um

1040
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,680
uh so

1041
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
i understand it's not a personal thing

1042
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,560
either um so so we do try again

1043
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,000
we do want to work with everyone thank

1044
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,350
you very much appreciate it

1045
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,079
[Music]

1046
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
do we have time for more questions yeah

1047
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
go for it

1048
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,760
hi could you go into a little bit more

1049
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,839
detail about the process that you guys

1050
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,920
go through when you are evaluating

1051
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,000
whether a data set is in the public

1052
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
interest or not that seems like a really

1053
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,520
hard question sometimes and i'd be

1054
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,920
curious to sort of hear a little bit

1055
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,359
more about that process yeah i'm still

1056
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,160
there

1057
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,119
emma do you want to take that

1058
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,599
yeah i actually just got asked that

1059
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,440
a couple of days ago by a reporter

1060
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,640
and the answer is it it varies it's

1061
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
different for every data set and every

1062
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,119
situation

1063
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,319
and i think

1064
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,160
the answer i wound up giving was

1065
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,800
i know it when i see it um

1066
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
you know i

1067
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,359
i hate to

1068
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,520
to make any supreme court reference

1069
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,599
right now

1070
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,720
uh pretty much buck scotus but um

1071
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,680
it's i know it when i see it and

1072
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
i mean we don't always all agree on it

1073
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
within the collective there are times

1074
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,200
where we have

1075
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,280
where we have disagreed on it and there

1076
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,960
are times where

1077
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,599
i don't know it when i see it and you

1078
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,520
know i initially review it and i'm just

1079
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,760
like oh

1080
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,400
i don't know or this could go either way

1081
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
or i don't know

1082
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,319
what to make of this and we'll have you

1083
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,560
know more of a discussion than usual

1084
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,119
about it and

1085
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,200
it really just varies from from

1086
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,640
situation to situation because the

1087
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,280
the math is always different um

1088
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,079
especially if there's a lot of personal

1089
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,760
information in it

1090
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,640
or

1091
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
you know it's a corporate data set

1092
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
versus a governmental one

1093
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,359
it's

1094
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,960
they're they're all they're all

1095
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,800
different you know they're all they're

1096
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
all different situations

1097
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,570
um

1098
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,880
[Music]

1099
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,440
if we can get requests for it it's a

1100
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,680
good indication of public interest in

1101
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,760
the data set yeah

1102
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
with like private infor stuff that we

1103
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,760
identify has personal information in

1104
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,560
there

1105
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
we always

1106
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,880
take much longer to deliberate um on

1107
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,720
that sort of stuff

1108
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,160
typically

1109
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,500
um

1110
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,680
[Music]

1111
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,440
the that we we have a sentence about

1112
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,599
that we you should usually go to but if

1113
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
you can make a primo facial like sort of

1114
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,839
showing that it's in the public interest

1115
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,400
usually that bar is fairly clear

1116
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,240
um

1117
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
when when it's clearly in the public

1118
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
interest um whether or not we release it

1119
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
is a different thing or like or will we

1120
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,800
prioritize it or anything like that um

1121
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
that's those are secondary questions but

1122
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,880
for the most part um

1123
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,560
everything that we've released you can

1124
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,640
we can make a sort of like

1125
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,079
two sentence

1126
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:42,960
like

1127
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,400
yes this is in the public interest

1128
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,240
because x y and z

1129
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
um but it it's often very complicated

1130
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
with personal information which we

1131
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,160
usually take a much longer time frame

1132
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,119
for

1133
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,240
um

1134
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,079
i don't know answer your question it

1135
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,560
does i really appreciate it

1136
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,319
the time

1137
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,960
okay um so we have time for a couple

1138
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,319
more questions and answers we've got

1139
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,440
about seven minutes so we'll just try

1140
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,200
again through quickly

1141
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,960
i do have a question from the matrix

1142
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,760
chat

1143
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
uh hypothetically

1144
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,400
would a 10-year archive of a previous

1145
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
president's tax returns

1146
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,040
be publishable by ddos via unlimited

1147
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,760
distribution and what are some if any

1148
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,400
pii constraints that that dios would

1149
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,720
face

1150
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,640
i don't think that that would be a

1151
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,000
limited distribution data set

1152
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,040
i mean

1153
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,920
i think that would be a public release

1154
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,200
but like

1155
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,240
the social security number or you know

1156
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,079
something like that but yeah we'll

1157
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,319
redact out the date of birth of date of

1158
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,920
birth or something

1159
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,200
yeah like

1160
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,920
the identity theft stuff sure we'll get

1161
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,280
rid of that but um

1162
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,000
yeah no tax tax returns of precedence

1163
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,560
and other basic financial disclosure

1164
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,720
stuff um

1165
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,880
hypothetically speaking seems like it's

1166
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,400
definitely in the public interest

1167
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,880
yeah the limited distribution stuff was

1168
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,240
like

1169
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,560
i mean gibson go where there was

1170
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
fundraisers for like

1171
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,720
church bake sales in addition to the

1172
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,200
proud boys and the oath keepers so

1173
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,440
those sorts of like mixed

1174
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,800
value data goes to the limbus category

1175
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,640
pretty easy but when it's tax returns of

1176
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,119
a public figure then that is not limited

1177
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
distribution

1178
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,599
next question hi gus andrews disarm

1179
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,079
foundation uh it sounded as if you would

1180
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,720
like to clone emma's skill set among

1181
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,280
many many people um i'm wondering for

1182
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
those who are in the room who might like

1183
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,400
to learn how to do analysis or to

1184
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
journalists who might be listening where

1185
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
do you suggest they go to learn more

1186
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,240
about doing that

1187
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,440
i think that might be an emma question

1188
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,680
um

1189
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,160
if i knew i

1190
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,240
i would be i would be

1191
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,839
trying to

1192
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,920
teach other people how to help me do

1193
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,040
this stuff but i am an absolutely

1194
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,480
terrible teacher um

1195
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,119
i mean some of the advice that i i give

1196
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,920
is like learn mosaic theory and i feel

1197
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,760
like that's pretty useless advice for

1198
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,560
most people honestly

1199
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,760
yeah i mean i think that the one skill

1200
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,880
set that i found invaluable is just

1201
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,480
looking through previous data sets and

1202
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,800
like trying to make sense of like how

1203
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,880
are the files formatted

1204
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,280
um or also trying to

1205
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,720
let's say that you didn't know where it

1206
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
came from try to like

1207
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
um

1208
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,240
figure out from

1209
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,160
from with no information where it could

1210
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,880
have come from um and i've found that

1211
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,560
you know sometimes when we're talk when

1212
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,599
we're talking about like what's the

1213
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,119
value of a data set

1214
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,440
and i'm like what company based in what

1215
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
country um and then you know i'll start

1216
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,319
digging a little bit deeper and i'll see

1217
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,160
like okay no it's not it's not just like

1218
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,960
some

1219
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
random person's

1220
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,119
you know information it's a it's a media

1221
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,599
conglomerate with a subsidy that's based

1222
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,240
in this country with a history of you

1223
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,559
know attacking activists and and so that

1224
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,480
kind of like level of going deeper into

1225
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,720
the data with no information sort of

1226
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,400
starts to give you both information

1227
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,319
about like what's the value of the data

1228
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,240
set um but then also gives you a good

1229
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,160
sense of like when you get see new data

1230
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,280
sets like

1231
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,880
how should you be thinking about going

1232
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,319
through them

1233
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,160
to authenticate it and also to find the

1234
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,879
value of them

1235
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,400
hopefully that helps

1236
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,640
thanks

1237
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,000
hello jason palladino good news i i just

1238
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,520
had a question you know once upon a time

1239
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
there was another group that

1240
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,000
became very well known for putting out

1241
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,440
information

1242
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,640
that it it received in various ways

1243
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,800
how does your group

1244
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,440
distinguish itself from that group and

1245
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,599
like are there lessons from that whole

1246
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,280
episode uh

1247
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,400
that you guys learned and want to

1248
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,160
let everyone know about well that's a

1249
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,920
quick one a for the

1250
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,319
end of the talk uh i mean i think that

1251
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,000
we

1252
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,200
are aware

1253
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,079
of

1254
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,960
this group that you allude to

1255
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,800
and

1256
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,240
that

1257
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,440
several of us

1258
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,520
have supported

1259
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,240
over the years or been involved with and

1260
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,000
moved away from

1261
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,240
i think that

1262
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
how we distinguish ourselves

1263
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,760
thank you

1264
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,240
we try to build checks and balances into

1265
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,480
the group we try to

1266
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,480
not centralize in any one member

1267
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,880
we requested multiple speakers for this

1268
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,839
talk

1269
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,800
and

1270
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,400
also at defcon it's not just one person

1271
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,800
redundancy if there's a task that only

1272
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,880
one person is doing find other people

1273
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,200
who can also do that task

1274
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
and

1275
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,880
um

1276
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,520
i don't know

1277
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
what what uh

1278
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,839
anything else

1279
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,839
without using four letter words uh no i

1280
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,760
think this covers it

1281
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,200
i think we have time for one more

1282
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,720
question and then we'll be hanging out

1283
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,720
outside

1284
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,440
a lot of the decisions that you've

1285
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,000
described have been around the ethics of

1286
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,359
what you do and what you don't do

1287
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,119
to me i find this really surprising

1288
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,440
because my mental model of the world we

1289
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,960
live in is when you start messing with

1290
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,400
people who are powerful they're going to

1291
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,079
come after you

1292
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,520
and you haven't mentioned that at all

1293
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,599
and so i'm curious about like

1294
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,680
how do you think about not getting

1295
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,079
arrested or not having evidence planted

1296
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,839
on you or like how do you stay safe

1297
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,200
is that not something you think about

1298
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,760
am i

1299
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,400
yeah i mean it's

1300
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,070
always the concern to a degree

1301
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,559
[Music]

1302
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,839
but

1303
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,319
paranoia doesn't create

1304
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,240
safety screaming about

1305
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,559
bogeymen doesn't create

1306
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,200
safety

1307
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,520
and talking about all the ways that

1308
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,920
people can screw you over doesn't create

1309
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,480
safety what it creates is mental

1310
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,359
instability in yourself and in your

1311
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,000
supporters

1312
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,160
you prepare for the things you can

1313
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,119
prepare for and

1314
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,839
that's the best you can do sometimes you

1315
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,760
will have the rug pulled out from under

1316
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,800
you

1317
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,920
uh you know a server was was seized in

1318
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,119
germany

1319
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,880
and

1320
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,400
we were we were once called uh criminal

1321
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,880
hackers by the department of homeland

1322
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,559
security

1323
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,440
but we got a good lawyer and we were

1324
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,119
patient and

1325
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,760
with a lot of research and the freedom

1326
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,720
of information act we were able to

1327
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,680
follow the trail of paperwork on that

1328
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
and basically debunk the department of

1329
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,280
homeland security's uh

1330
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,960
story on how they got to that and it's

1331
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,960
even more ludicrous than

1332
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,280
than you might think

1333
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,839
you can find that on twitter i got into

1334
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,359
that on juneteenth the two year

1335
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,839
anniversary of blue

1336
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,680
leaks like lorax mentioned

1337
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,680
we were both singled out

1338
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,040
in the

1339
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,200
bahamas attorney general's

1340
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,240
ludicrous story about how

1341
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
things were supposedly hacked they got

1342
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,480
all sorts of details wrong aside from

1343
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
mentioning us

1344
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,040
people can always try to come after you

1345
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,160
but if you let it stop you

1346
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,040
nothing will ever get done

1347
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,720
so again we prepare the best we we can

1348
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,240
and

1349
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,880
we're doing as much as we can

1350
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,599
and we'll take this as far as we can

1351
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,010
and

1352

one day hopefully we'll retire and

1354
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,119
someone else

1355
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,440
and keep going further hopefully other

1356
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,960
people will pick up the ball while we're

1357
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,640
still doing this because we don't want

1358
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
to be the only ones doing it

1359
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,720
because there should be other models

1360
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,960
that are doing this there should be more

1361
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,160
than just one target

1362
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,119
but

1363
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,160
you know we're we're just gonna do what

1364
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,400
we can as best we can for as long as we

1365
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,920
can and whatever happens happens

1366
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,720
but

1367
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,119
yeah we're gonna do it as as ethically

1368
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,240
as we can

1369
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,280
because

1370
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,920
what's the alternative

1371
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,800
play

1372
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
played by the rules that we're objecting

1373
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,040
to

1374
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,359
it also helps to have transparency both

1375
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,720
internally

1376
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,520
externally and like because of how

1377
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,040
egalitarian the group is there's a lot

1378
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,599
of solidarity and i think a lot of us

1379
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,920
find solace in that where

1380
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,000
i think that provides safety too yeah

1381
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,880
like

1382
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,800
solidarity um

1383
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,640
offered by others like in the space this

1384
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,880
event is really exciting for me to come

1385
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
to because

1386
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,880
it's a place where i

1387
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,200
think that there's

1388
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,240
support for the idea of using hacked

1389
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,119
data and leaked data for research so

1390
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,359
thanks for having us

1391
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,359
thanks

1392
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,749
