read and share

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
because obviously there are some stories

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
from uh the past perfect 26 years

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,719
that uh might not be as uh good to put

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,120
online

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
yeah i don't know how much for everyone

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,879
statues and limitations are up i know

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,879
for most of my stories there that and

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
even then i'm going to explore like the

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
names and details for protect the

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
innocent the law and order dun dun dun

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,959
dun dun fyi because your speaker while

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,320
you're speaking you can take the mask

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
off okay also quick heads up for

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
everyone in the audience we do have a

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
microphone set up there and we would

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
really really appreciate it if you'd

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
come up and speak into that mic when

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
you're sharing your stories

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
are we copic

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
because i have everything

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
is it not set to output correctly

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,479
okay

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,479
finally

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,920
we've made it to the end of another day

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
of hope

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
i want to thank everyone for being with

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
us and for being with us through

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,479
these uh lovely technical issues

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,798
our final talk for the night

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
the question was do i remember any hope

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
without technical issues and i am going

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
to refrain from answering that question

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,480
on advice of counsel

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
or were you only drunk

53
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
look sometimes

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
wrong wrong spiel it's like i keep

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
writing these down and it's very easy

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
for me to

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
lose track of the one that i have

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,959
when it open let's talk

59
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
now

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
when it opened in 1919 it was the

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
largest hotel on earth

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
and in 2020 we received the cruelest

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
april fool's joke

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,480
in its permanent closure

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
for 24 years and 11 incarnations of hope

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
it was our place where we found

67
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
community

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
from the dankness of the sub-basement

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
through the notoriously unreliable

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
elevators to the non-existent rooftop

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,400
pool sorry to break the illusion

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
it was home

73
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
our speaker side pocket and neo want to

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
share some of their memories of the

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
place with

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
the memorable phone number pennsylvania

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,920
6 5000.

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
i feel like taking this mask off is like

79
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
that scene from empire strikes back with

80
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
vader's mask in his little pod

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,360
there we go oh god now you see how

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,879
horrifying i look

83
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
yes

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,200
side pocket unmasked and

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,080
needs lots of hair repair um hi welcome

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
to this uh

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
very uh

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
i guess we're all kind of feeling the

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,799
same way for those who've encountered

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
the hotel whether you were at it for

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,159
hope or for other reasons which i will

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
get into in a moment where it's sort of

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
like a mix of you know it's weird

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
because at the last hope which thank you

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
emmanuel goldstein for making that whole

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
naming convention confusing um but at

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
what was called the last hope which came

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
after uh hope number six

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,478
um

100
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,478
because we're like microsoft versions we

101
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
don't know how to count

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,959
um

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
we we did a mock funeral

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
for the hotel

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
and because we live in this cursed

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
timeline ron paul arms it's actually

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,280
happening

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
so

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,199
i'm feeling now the real mix of

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,639
especially with my involvement which

111
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
i'll get into in a bit about how much i

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
strangely missed that place because as

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,919
emmanuel has often summed up in the past

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,199
for that uh hotel that it was a dump but

115
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,320
it was our dump

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,759
and that's how i felt like that so thank

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
you for talking i was just wanting to

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
know as much as it's going to drive neo

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
crazy just through the interest of time

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,759
this part's by the way going to be

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
really quick i'm going to open the zoom

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
when i'm done with this portion so that

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
way he can join in yell at me and then

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,919
start rambling on cranky kong style with

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,039
his stories

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,160
uh so

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,199
it's going to be fun because i get to

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,639
introduce him so this will be great so

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
let's go

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
if i can

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
technology

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
in here yay

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
so first up is neo uh he's going to have

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
a talk uh tomorrow i believe it's is

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
that 4pm i believe

136
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
at 4pm uh i can't remember which room

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
unfortunately um

138
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
about um

139
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,759
working in accessibility for uh

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
processing books from text to audio

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
he's most notorious for speaking three

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
times at hope about accessibility called

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
accessibility dammit

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
he's also a long time hope alumni

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,639
and by a long time i think we went to

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
hope around the same time which just as

147
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
a warning i started at actually the last

148
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
hope i was technically there for

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
the last hour or so of hope number six

150
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
because i actually found out the con was

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
happening right when it was closing so

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
they just let me wander in for free and

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
no one knew who it was at the time

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
because no one cared uh but we've known

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
each other we met 2600 meetings in new

156
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,160
york we've been around for many years

157
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
and i'm happy to call neo as like also a

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
long time friend we're also both

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
different talk that maybe will come on

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,879

205
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
live in this hellhole uh [ __ ] scotus and

206
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
i know this is a really long url but i

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
can also share it in a bit in the future

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
um

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,599
just as a personal thing in my

210
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
organization up until we've been i've

211
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,039
been live streaming at hope and all the

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
way up until the end of august uh so

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
we'll cover that other con too with this

214
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
but we are trying to raise money uh for

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
the national abortion federation uh

216
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
their group that works both legally

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,000
and in person to help medical doctors

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
for safe and free abortions they've been

219
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
working with the aclu and other people

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,279
to tackle the legal side they basically

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
cover that whole arena

222
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,919
there's also many other organizations

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,760

224

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,680
questions of one why they chose hotel

337
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,120
pen i don't know if anyone can answer

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
that if they're an old be here and two

339
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
what happened with that one weird year

340
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
we went over to a building that

341
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,760
people barely remember

342
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,680
yeah

343
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
no they used to hold the dog show

344
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
convention we're gonna get into like all

345
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
the times this has been like on film and

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
stuff like that

347
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
so just as i want to really quickly

348
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
recap trust me we're going to get in the

349
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,680
media this is that this talk's going to

350
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
be really short uh the talk part it's

351
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
going to be the beginning an overview of

352
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,079
the hotel pennsylvania then we're going

353
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,600
to get right into

354
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
my own and neozone retrospective on

355
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
hackers on planet earth and our

356
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
involvement and then we're opening up to

357
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
everyone and we're going to tell random

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
stories and we're basically going to be

359
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
here until they're sick and tired of us

360
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
and kick us out so i literally told them

361
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
when they said i bet it's folks yep that

362
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,959
we can that just agents steal us and put

363
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,920
us near the end and we're just going to

364
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
keep going on until no one likes me

365
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
anymore

366
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
stuff that that by the way the agent

367
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,639
still said that that room was always

368
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
interesting because he would literally

369
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
go on to like six or eight in the

370
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
morning originally he kept going over on

371
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
his talks and unlike what we did with

372
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,519
steve rambram they put him at the end so

373
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,519
he could go on and going in that room

374
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
it's like there was like a mist in there

375
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,600
and like it was just everyone was in

376
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
like the same weight in the same suit it

377
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,120
was like clones

378
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,639
it's just you felt like you were in a

379
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,040
different universe

380
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
like 184 of the hotel

381
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
so what the [ __ ] was a hotel pen so

382
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,600
uh i was located on uh 7th avenue uh if

383
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,880
you've ever tried to walk that that's

384
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
like one of the slowest sorry the

385
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
fastest light changes they expect you to

386
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
cross a street that takes like 14

387
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
seconds in two seconds then you know new

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
york minute

389
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,279
uh

390
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,040
and it's been home for hackers on planet

391
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,720
earth since uh 1994. uh not too far away

392
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
from the other conference it starts with

393
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,199
a d and ends with a con uh born around

394
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,720
the same time so it's i call it like the

395
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
silver age of uh hacker conventions

396
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
essentially because uh people don't

397
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,519
realize that even before that there was

398
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,959
phone freaking conventions where people

399
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
wore like domino masks and stuff we

400
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
should bring that back honestly both the

401
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
phone freaking and the domino mess

402
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
uh so what what so since the hotel's

403
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
gonna be demolished what ugly piece of

404
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
[ __ ] are they putting there now so it's

405
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
gonna be called 15-pin plaza this was

406
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
originally the vernado's plan

407
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
this is originally renato's og plan from

408
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
back in the day which is the giant box

409
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
of ads

410
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,399
um

411
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,760
here's what it looks like

412
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
that's exactly what it is the text kind

413
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
of goes across the page but at the end

414
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,120
it says you can vomit now um

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
yeah i don't know what's so odd about

416
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
the timing of this too is that they want

417
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,959
this to be like the upper supposed to be

418
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,760
first of all um funny enough the

419
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
the biggest group that's been bitching

420
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
about this new building is the empire

421
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
state building because they basically

422
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,160
have building envy and they're like all

423
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
the new new york buildings are taller

424
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,880
than us please don't make another one

425
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
that's like right next to us that is as

426
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
tall so they actually it's

427
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
yep it's slightly shorter so it's

428
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,639
appease them but you're supposed to

429
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
rent it out to like a bunch of business

430
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,920
owners but it's like guys between covet

431
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,519
and eric adams like no one lives in new

432
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
york city anymore especially in that

433
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
zone so like i just like good luck with

434
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
that i just

435
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,399
it's another

436
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
and what's

437
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,880
i don't know what's going on with these

438
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
like new designs everything looks like

439
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
it's from the new deus ex reboot i just

440
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
i don't know

441
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,360
so

442
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,199
fun thing about this picture i know most

443
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
people seen that this is

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,959
100 sure

445
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
but allegedly you see all the horse and

446
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
buggies the scaffolding to the right of

447
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
the picture is the beginning supposedly

448
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
the foundation of the hotel pennsylvania

449
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
when it was being right across it is

450
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
what used to be the pennsylvania

451
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
railroad station the whole point of

452
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,399
having hotel pennsylvania there was to

453
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,040
be a place where you could crash right

454
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
after you got off the train so basically

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,759
they invented the subway

456
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,720
yep

457
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
and uh and this is also speaking of

458
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,560
crashing into things in new york this

459
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
was before the taxi services and

460
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
everything um but yeah eventually when

461
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,399
it finally got bill it was open on

462
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,519
january 25th 1919 at the time it was the

463
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,800
world's largest hotel with 2 200 guest

464
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,160
rooms uh many that we've stayed at um

465
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,199
weird question that i was actually going

466
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,160
to bring up later we're going to bring

467
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
up now so how many the people who

468
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
attended the convention went to the roof

469
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,800
even though they were not supposed to we

470
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,079
don't actually how many people were

471
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,120
supposed to be on the roof because they

472
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
were staff

473
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
and now how many people were all on the

474
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
roof in general

475
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
exactly

476
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
uh so i always call that broke um what's

477
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,400
woke is who's ever been to the basement

478
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,839
of the hotel

479
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
and the better question is which one of

480
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
them yes

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
there's a second one that's how i was

482
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,000
gonna bring you up was thank you the

483
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
third one second one yeah third one

484
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,160
fourth one it keeps going on it's like

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,880
it's like dante's inferno literally

486
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
but what's so bizarre about it and i

487
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
wish we had i tried to find pictures

488
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
because there's a picture of mines

489
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,919
coming up later where i was in those

490
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,520
they let me cart blanche travel through

491
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
the place and it's literally

492
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
it's like its own time book where the

493
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
further you go through the basements you

494
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,679
actually go back in time to what the

495
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,160
hotel used to be like so i believe the

496
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,360
end the first basement they have like

497
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
the original like pink carpeting and

498
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
doors and stuff the second basement had

499
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
the original bathtubs which are those

500
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
those toe call clawed bathtubs that

501
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,559
every shitty new york building used to

502
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
have um and then there's a really cool

503
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,080
picture that's going to be later on that

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
i'm still happy i was able to take that

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
but yeah this hotel has been around for

506
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,799
a long ass time even before we showed up

507
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,600
um it's also been around so long that

508
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
everyone kept trying to reinvent it

509
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
again the text goes across the page

510
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,720
because technology

511
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
uh but it changed multiple names what

512
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,919
were the was it three or four names neo

513
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,480
um the statler

514
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,240
there's the the new york penta which was

515
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
the last one before it came became hotel

516
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
pen again right yeah it's basically it's

517
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
in our description thing it's gone full

518
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
circle it has like four different names

519
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,000
and that's kevin

520
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,039
r ultimately you're dealing with

521
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
pennsylvania railroads so yeah it all

522
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
got screwed up somewhere it kept being

523
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,039
kept being pushed around sold to

524
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,720
different companies and started us hotel

525
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
pen did five different name changes and

526
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
came back to hotel pen again so

527
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,600
probably the reason why

528
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
we called it circle of hope but we'll

529
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
get to that convention we get there

530
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
um lots of strange history at the hotel

531
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
even before we showed up there's a bunch

532
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
on there um some of the highlights is

533
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,840
that uh houdini uh

534
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
kind of like um trying to remember a guy

535
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
randy um who's kind of his successor in

536
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
terms of this magicians often debunk

537
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,120
like act like people who think try to

538
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
convince you magic is real and he did a

539
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,919
really famous debunking sort of there so

540
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
it was kind of the hacker spirit even

541
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
before we kind of got there doing

542
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,840
similar things william faulkner uh wrote

543
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
stayed there while writing one of his

544
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
famous novels

545
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
um herbert hoover uh that failure of the

546
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
president which now he seems like

547
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
freaking um

548
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
caesar by comparison with our current

549
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
presidencies uh spoke at the ohio

550
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
society of new york um in 1935 and the

551
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,520
um the american russian institute

552
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
presented its first annual award to

553
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
franklin d roosevelt uh and the last

554
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
couple things i thought this was like

555
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,320
the most weirder stuff um

556
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
in the 1920s a famous crime boss

557
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
nicknamed johnny jack newest threw a a

558
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
forty thousand dollar party at the hotel

559
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
pennsylvania and allegedly uh people

560
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,880
were

561
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
bathing in champaign at the hotel which

562
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
i think if we knew that it was going to

563
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
be the last time when we were there at

564
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
circle hope i think we that's what we

565
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,159
would have done

566
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,640
we would have yeah

567
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,080
also

568
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
in 2020

569
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,520
we want to we want to bathe in luxury

570
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,840
not in like imported urine yeah

571
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,080
delts are piss yeah

572
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
i know right we'll get into that whole

573
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,000
thing in a bit and the one that got cut

574
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
off is that um fidel castro actually

575
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
visited during a political rally there

576
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
that's a picture of him at the you can

577
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
see the square part where it says hotel

578
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
pen

579
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
so yes we've always been like leftist

580
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
heathens even before we showed up at the

581
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
hotel

582
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
uh it's also been even though it's cut

583
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
off in a lot of different um properties

584
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
and movies uh there's a little bit of a

585
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
debate too of like what do you consider

586
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,559
because as neo pointed out

587
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,679
the hotel pen with the what we now known

588
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,440
as the madison square garden area that

589
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
whole penn station that's why they're

590
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,360
named that they're supposed to exist as

591
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
a unit again you're supposed to travel

592
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
to there and then without going above

593
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
ground you would be able to enter in and

594
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,600
stay at the hotel so they both fed off

595
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
of each other so there's a lot of films

596
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
that both featured

597
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
um hotel penn the the station sorry penn

598
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
station as well as hotel pen itself um

599
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
throughout history including probably

600
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
the most one of the most famous ones

601
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,400
side reference to gimbals uh where you

602
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
look about gimbals in the miracle of

603
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
34th street that was a reference to

604
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,159
macy's but gimbles was right behind the

605
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
hotel pen what is now currently and

606
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
probably will no longer be the

607
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,640
manhattan plaza mall or whatever the

608
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
hell it's called who cared anyway he was

609
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
just uh kept trying to capitalism but

610
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,799
one of these sub levels allowed you to

611
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,400
go from the one train from lirr amtrak

612
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
new jersey's transit straight through

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
the hotel and into gimbals so you could

614
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,000
shop

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
stay at the hotel and then get the hell

616
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
back home

617
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,559
preferably before rush hour

618
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,400
and uh wasn't going to get with that uh

619
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
brain freeze because crazy times of the

620
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,600
day

621
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
pressing f5 on your brain yes there's

622
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
also a lot of um shows that don't

623
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
feature the hotel like there was a

624
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,000
studio built in the hotel i've been

625
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,159
there multiple times they would do shows

626
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
there and probably the most famous

627
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,080
infamous in my opinion is the episodes

628
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
of the mars show used to be filmed there

629
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,840
so all the you not the father break

630
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,760
dancing stuff that was that hotel

631
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
pennsylvania and they also did the dog

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
shows there

633
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
crazy

634
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
hotel that had no problem with dogs yeah

635
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
that's why they were very popular with

636
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,120
the kennel club and that's also why

637
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
there was the phrasing of we host a dog

638
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,039
show every year and for some reason it's

639
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
the hacker conference that usually ends

640
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
up smelling by the middle of saturday i

641
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
don't know why

642
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
so speaking of which even though the

643
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
images did not load unfortunately i'll

644
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
load it later is

645
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
that's a picture of the second because

646
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
they left it alone so it also that

647
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
second basement floods the lower

648
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,720
basement so it rot out that's one of my

649
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,880
photos there's also another photo that i

650
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,159
took that i'll bring up later since i

651
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
didn't properly load where

652
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
the story goes is that when they

653
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
separated both the penn station the

654
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,679
hotel that they filled the entire entire

655
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,600
tunnel in concrete and while that was

656
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,640
true they didn't fill it all the way and

657
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
so i'm very proud and honored that i

658
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
have one of the few remaining photos

659
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
this one and another one that went off

660
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
all the way to the left because i guess

661
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
we built it in css um

662
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,039
that

663
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
they kept them they kept part of the

664
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
tunnel because it has the mosaic mural

665
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
if you ever gone to a older not up kept

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
um hotel subway station you often see

667
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
these mosaics made out in tile that says

668
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,200
you know

669
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,159
canal

670
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,000
street and people cover the sea so it

671
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,919
spells anal um guilty and there's uh yep

672
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
and there's

673
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,559
we've been hacked

674
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:11,679
[Applause]

675
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,320
all right i love that it was like we're

676
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
talking about hotel pen and i think this

677
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
is like the entire summary of what it's

678
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,400
like to run hope in the past years all

679
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
it would battle so i'm already happy

680
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
about this as it slowly

681
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,520
comes back down

682
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
applaud for that dude you did some that

683
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,919
that's the equivalent of that hacker

684
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
magic where you just like control shift

685
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,840
s and it's like where did you hack nasa

686
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
i don't know what you did

687
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,720
but yeah um the mosaic that says to

688
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
pennsylvania station is they still kept

689
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,600
that now here's the crazy part about the

690
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
new building

691
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
they're one of their big plans which is

692
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
why it's been taking so long to build

693
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
the [ __ ] thing is that they're going

694
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
to restore that tunnel

695
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
to the new one yeah and this is a

696
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,919
problem because they have to use a

697
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
combination of drilling and explosives

698
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,200
to do that so one of the reasons it

699
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,039
takes forever is because every time you

700
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
self explosive there bothers all the

701
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
blocks underground in a 20 block radius

702
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,960
so

703
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
not only that but it also interferes

704
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
with long island railroad new jersey

705
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
transit amtrak because that hotel

706
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,799
is built

707
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
on top of

708
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
all the tr all the east river tunnels

709
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,120
yep so you have to take extreme caution

710
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
for that and also the wiring of the

711
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
building i don't think we ever mentioned

712
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
the fact that it's one of the oldest

713
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,080
still-in-use telephone numbers yep well

714
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
larry for the building went down to the

715
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
sub sub sub sub basement

716
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
hence the uh famous song pennsylvania um

717
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,919
six five thousand

718
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,039
everybody can we get a cheer if

719
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
everybody just sings pennsylvania six

720
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
five thousand come on three two one

721
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
pennsylvania six five thousand

722
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
and then we get the dmca strike

723
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
so as i said this would be the first

724
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
presentation on doing reviewing stuff

725
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
from the hotel so i guess we're gonna

726
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159
get into uh hope memory time

727
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,799
um i'm gonna try to go through i'm gonna

728
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
start off with a bit about myself and

729
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,159
i'm gonna open up to everyone else and

730
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
also i don't know what do we have public

731
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
microphones out here in this room okay

732
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,919
okay because otherwise i'd be like stand

733
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
here and you get to be the presenter

734
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,960
like cardboard cut out of side pocket

735
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
microphone this hope is going very well

736
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,760
yes

737
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,919
so uh yeah that's one of the new that's

738
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,200
the other thing too that's going to be

739
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,279
interesting is that you know

740
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
it's so weird to see this as past

741
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,159
history but one of the reasons why it's

742
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,120
called new hope is we get to make new

743
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
positive

744
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,039
horrific memories at our new location

745
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
and turnout

746
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,080
in fact one of the nervousness about

747
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
this panel is i was worried that there

748
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
would be staff here from uh st john's

749
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
and them not realizing the bottom line

750
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,840
they signed just being like oh no we've

751
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,559
made a horrible mistake

752
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
yeah oh god well is there more googly

753
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,679
eyes on the crucifix

754
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,440
i don't know who did that but great job

755
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
the all-seeing eye you know um

756
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,600
oh there's been so much stuff

757
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
you know if you're able to physically

758
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,480
come out here tomorrow because i know

759
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,279
you got stuck in the twilight zone uh

760
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,880
you're just gonna i'll be there come

761
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,360
hell or high water or basically hotel

762
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
pen yeah actually i think about it by

763
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
the way that's a picture of one of the

764
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
earliest pictures of the what the rooms

765
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
look like i believe it's from late 50s

766
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,799
early 60s i think

767
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,240
yeah

768
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,640
some other it was also weird is like

769
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
there were so many different types of

770
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
rooms by the way there like um here's a

771
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,399
fun random story this actually happened

772
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,440
at the last hope was um so i have a long

773
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
time friend that i'm gonna get into

774
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,840
later nate murdock who couldn't be here

775
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,720
and

776
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
uh fellow phone losers of america and

777
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,760
the

778
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
the his boyfriend that he was dating at

779
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,000
the time um turns out render man is an

780
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
actual ordained officiator so under the

781
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
canadian flag we unofficially officially

782
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,120
married them in their hotel room and

783
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
that was like a i remember i thought

784
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
originally i was the largest room they

785
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,600
had like two bedrooms it was this long

786
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,960
hallway and i'm like how did you rent

787
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,480
out a mansion and i found out there was

788
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
rooms that were even bigger than that

789
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
that like you could see the floor dip

790
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
where they used to have a stove in those

791
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
rooms and stuff which i cannot think

792
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
about like hotel pen having this like

793
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,039
fire instant fire in your rooms at any

794
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,080
time

795
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,200
oh boy

796
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
all you have to do is go back about uh

797
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
three or four months when they were

798
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
doing the demolition work on the hotel

799
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,799
uh they did actually set up a fire by

800
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,399
accident yes

801
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,600
accident

802
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
the day the day the conference was

803
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
announced actually yeah

804
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
that was that was us just you know being

805
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,760
like your move dick weasels

806
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,640
um

807
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
but yeah officially the last hope was um

808
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
my first one uh things that i remember

809
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
from that was starting off the tradition

810
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
that a lot of people realize that

811
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,960
um a frequent keynote speaker we used to

812
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
have was gel biafra of uh

813
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,320
from uh the band that my brain is dying

814
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,360
for the name

815
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,799
dead candies

816
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,480
that's how long i've been

817
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,679
i've been working on the sun for four

818
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,679
hours among other things so

819
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,640
fun

820
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
um and believe it or not every the room

821
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,640
they would usually host him in had

822
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
really comfortable floors so while

823
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
everyone else was enamored by his talk i

824
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,559
would actually be in there actually

825
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
catching up on z's

826
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
and i'd like to not because this talk

827
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,600
was boring or anything it was just

828
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
literally a comfy floor and i'd sleep

829
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,919
there

830
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,760
and i think enough people slept in there

831
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,039
that

832
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,279
i hope that i guess that maybe inspired

833
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
the hammock area

834
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
slept in the hammocks that hope during

835
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
the multiple years

836
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,799
and survived

837
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
who fell out of a hammock

838
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
at home oh yeah

839
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
yeah emt is on scene yep um so

840
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
funny story about me with the hammocks

841
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,279
um and i'll open it up more

842
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,440
the first year which i

843
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,039
that was the last hope if i wrote

844
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,559
correctly or was it the next i think it

845
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
was

846
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,159
which i think yeah i think it was the

847
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,760
last hope that we had the hammocks for

848
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,320
the no next hope was the first time see

849
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,000
the naming convention

850
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
um

851
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
yes

852
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
i always thought that if we ever did

853
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,399
like a truly last one it'd either be

854
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,799
called no hope or [ __ ] hope so being one

855
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,159
of those two

856
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,080
not to like [ __ ] cope the convention but

857
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
just like general phrase but anyway back

858
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,480
to the story so

859
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
if you've ever slept in the hammock area

860
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,159
you've noticed that they always put it

861
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,360
in like

862
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,559
all the way out the other side of the

863
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
con where no one disturbs you and

864
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
everything

865
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
i'm happy they did that because that's

866
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,559
not the way it was the first year i

867
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,080
still want to find

868
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,919
who thought this was a great idea but

869
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,760
the first time they had the hammocks

870
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
they put it right in front of a giant

871
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
projection screen area for everyone

872
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,360
which is not a problem because they

873
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,720
thought hey you'd lay in the hammock

874
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
watch stuff the cons and things

875
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
the problem was is that someone had the

876
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
other brilliant idea that as long as it

877
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
wasn't like straight up porn or snuff

878
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
films you could play any video you want

879
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
on that screen

880
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,039
so as some staff people remember of me

881
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,960
complaining about this i

882
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
after a long

883
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,279
friday and saturday night day friday

884
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,279
night saturday day during the daytime at

885
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
hope fell asleep

886
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,559
in a hammock

887
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,000
woke up

888
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
to a documentary i that exists that i've

889
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,200
never seen before in my life called

890
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,399
crackheads gone wild

891
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,159
so imagine you're waking up from

892
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,600
dreamless sleep

893
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
and you're like

894
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
why are there two crackheads giving oral

895
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,120
sex to each other and now just went

896
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,919
through a traffic cone what is because i

897
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,840
thought i was like i'm like i didn't do

898
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,919
any drugs at this con

899
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,480
like for once i did i yeah like i'm like

900
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,960
what you buy i'm like no

901
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,440
front of my face

902
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,039
oh man

903
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:57,919
oh

904
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,360
geez

905
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
that was a that was so i'm happy that

906
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,480
that's one of the few times i hope that

907
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
like it's like we learned from our

908
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,120
experiences

909
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,440
um does anyone uh have any interesting

910
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
stories about like dumb spending just

911
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
like time at the hotel

912
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,519
like any room store is that

913
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,880
limitations or you want to throw people

914
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
under the bus uh i mean i could follow

915
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
up with the phone i don't care

916
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
uh it's up to step there's one in the

917
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,919
back

918
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
follow follow the follow the blaming

919
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
points

920
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,399
i went to hope a lot of times this is an

921
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,440
icon

922
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
i went to

923
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
yes i went to hope a lot of times it's

924
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,399
fantastic the hotel is obviously a dump

925
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,240
the rooms are terrible the basement's

926
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,600
amazing

927
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
being led around the basement apparently

928
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,799
the hotel

929
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,559
had um

930
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,519
direct current power originally and

931
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,159
it also had some device in the basement

932
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,399
where you could sign a document

933
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,279
and it would electronically sign it in

934
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,360
chicago like some sort of pen that you

935
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,159
could grab and like move it around so if

936
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,080
you got one of these basement tours

937
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
there's just so much amazing [ __ ] down

938
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,720
there

939
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
and one of the things that was nice

940
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
about the hotel is especially for a

941
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
hacker conference is that

942
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,399
it was there was so much space for

943
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,960
exploration because the hotel

944
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
they only used parts of the hotel like

945
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,559
it seemed like 50 of the hotel was

946
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,880
unused and you would go into the halls

947
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
and you just find these like deserted

948
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
like haunted ballrooms and you're just

949
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,159
like what the [ __ ] is in here is there

950
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,720
ghosts in here literally hotel pen is

951
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,799
probably the o.g liminal space meme

952
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,120
yeah and you'd and and and i would find

953
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
these places because you know trying to

954
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,760
get to the roof to party on the roof and

955
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,000
i could never remember the exact way and

956
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,919
somebody had shown me and i would try to

957
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
find it and i would go through and i

958
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,320
would go to stairways and hit a dead end

959
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
and be like wait where you know go back

960
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
some other different way and you turn

961
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
around and you get attacked by barney

962
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,919
the dinosaur or jason scott dresses

963
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,840
barney the dinosaur

964
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,279
i just want to know who it was who

965
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
chewed through the cabling that we put

966
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,840
up between the 20th oh the switchblade

967
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
thing yeah someone cut off the internet

968
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
between both floors

969
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,079
and

970
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,359
they've been in frustration trying to

971
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,040
find their way climbing up the rope in

972
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,159
order to get to the roof and then

973
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,440
cutting the line behind them like

974
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,199
pizarro or something you know making

975
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,800
sure nobody else could follow them up i

976
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
wouldn't be surprised if like a group of

977
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,760
friends like told their friend their

978
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
non-technical friend of like no if you

979
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
actually open the wire and listen you

980
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,119
can hear the internet and like

981
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,879
that's what happened there and i think

982
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,040
the following years after that it was we

983
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
got per i think it was we got permission

984
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
to use a certain wet wall to run the

985
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
wire down which caused like more hell

986
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,679
for staff members and the knock to set

987
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,280
things up because you're like spelunking

988
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,119
through this hotel and there's like a

989
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,399
mummified body in the wall and you're

990
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,800
like get out

991
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,560
so that was its own hell but uh thank

992
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,839
you for that i also liked that the

993
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,359
beginning of your their thing there was

994
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
like the yelp review of the hotel it was

995
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,599
like obviously a dump it was awesome for

996
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,839
a con four and a half stars would do

997
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,079
again the cheat code to get to get up to

998
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,680
the roof was there's uh there's a

999
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
service elevator and if you could find

1000
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,640
the service elevator then you could

1001
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,400
easily get to the roof speaking of the

1002
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
elevators um

1003
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
um

1004
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,720
oh wait let me just say one more sure so

1005
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
so then eventually they said in like

1006
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,240
2014 2016 don't go to roof no more and i

1007
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,599
kind of thought i was like not real

1008
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,920
serious and so like went to the roof and

1009
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,359
got turned back and then we went up

1010
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,400
again

1011
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
and we got up to the roof and then

1012
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,000
eventually security kicked us off and

1013
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
then took the badges away and then going

1014
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
down to the security the next and i'm

1015
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,400
trying to like see if i can sneak in and

1016
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,920
meanwhile they're going over the pa

1017
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,079
saying some [ __ ] who didn't listen

1018
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,240
and went on the roof and so the main

1019
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
problem i remember one year and i can't

1020
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,599
remember which one it was it was

1021
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,839
definitely one of the later ones where

1022
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,599
it wasn't even just random people going

1023
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
to the roof the problem is that someone

1024
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,760
would bring a prominent popular person

1025
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,160
to the roof so all of their fan base

1026
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
would follow in so like it'd be someone

1027
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
like a major person up from the eff or

1028
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,599
the keynote and they'd bring them there

1029
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
so all of their groupies showed up and i

1030
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,119
remember one particular year was

1031
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
horrifying security like

1032
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
the reason why they were being such

1033
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
[ __ ] on the roof if like get off is

1034
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,480
because i'd be on the ground floor and i

1035
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
would literally see

1036
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,680
20 nypd officers in full riot gear with

1037
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,520
like their batons and that like there's

1038
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,160
like hackers for hunting season and

1039
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,599
and then they get disappointed like no

1040
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,640
there's no one up there anymore and

1041
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
they're like oh you know now we have to

1042
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,720
beat up minorities

1043
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
and in the meantime not only was the

1044
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,119
roof a problem but also occasionally

1045
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
some special announcement we've made by

1046
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,640
a major keynote person who i am not

1047
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,839
going to mention but i'm just going to

1048
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,440
say the next time you want to hand out

1049
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,160
your business card with you know lock

1050
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,440
picks in them

1051
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
that's security no ahead of time because

1052
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,119
i got to tell you kevin mitnick the

1053
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,560
whole time i was sitting down there at

1054
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,040
the front door i see like hundreds of

1055
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,839
hackers racing through a glass door i

1056
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,359
can't tell who's got the badge on who

1057
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,800
doesn't who has to pay who doesn't have

1058
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
to pay all i know is that they're going

1059
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
to break down the building

1060
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,800
so um i i know johannes wants to say

1061
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
something but right before that and it's

1062
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,440
probably going to hit the rest of my

1063
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,640
time

1064
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
i particularly want to call it neo and

1065
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
uh liz and anyone who ever worked at

1066
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,720
what was called the disinformation booth

1067
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
is there anything you would want to

1068
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,000
share about your stories about running

1069
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,599
that hellhole i just got one question

1070
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
what's going on the fourth track

1071
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
what that disconn

1072
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,000
any track we never knew

1073
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,160
but this information desk was set up

1074
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
basically because nobody had any

1075
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,000
information and that people would come

1076
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,359
up to security of and i was doing

1077
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,440
security i think my second hope

1078
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,040
and asking you know what's going on

1079
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
what's going on because i was apparently

1080
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,240
the only sober person in all of security

1081
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,440
well you were the one with all the

1082
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
coffee so yeah

1083
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
i wanna just say uh anytime i fall

1084
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,359
asleep during a hope something awful

1085
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
would happen this is a fact it was

1086
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,240
proven the last two or three years so i

1087
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
made a habit to not sleep at the hope

1088
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,520
conference

1089
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,440
my people would crash out and they would

1090
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
join the info desk just to get a place

1091
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,359
to sleep for like nothing so radio

1092
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,839
statler was usually right across like

1093
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,720
diagonally from the disinformation booth

1094
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
and uh the two things that i remember

1095
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,599
particularly from that and i'll give it

1096
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,920
up to johannes is um

1097
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,560
one is my favorite aka not favorite

1098
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,760
thing you guys would do even though it

1099
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,359
was completely right is people would ask

1100
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,240
you guys questions and you would just go

1101
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
do you see the guy with the crazy hair

1102
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
by the yeah by the radio that side

1103
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
pocket ask him we don't know for some

1104
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
reason although we're info he'll know

1105
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,359
and i felt like if you've seen south

1106
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,359
park like when they say like token

1107
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,800
you're black you know how to play bass

1108
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,400
like they go over and it's like i'm like

1109
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
[ __ ] i actually know the answer to that

1110
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,200
too

1111
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,599
so then my second my favorite thing i

1112
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,960
don't know if you two had a favorite

1113
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,359
question you guys got but

1114
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,640
my favorite one now i'm going to let you

1115
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,520
say it and then gonna go johannes is

1116
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,200
the multiple times

1117
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
where so you have to understand

1118
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,800
usually the entrance where security

1119
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
would be is at the bottom of the

1120
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,320
escalators you have to go up past them

1121
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
to get into the con and go up the

1122
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
escalators go into the mezzanine for the

1123
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
first half of the convention so my

1124
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,440
favorite would be is that some schmuck

1125
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
would go to the information desk and

1126
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,160
legit be confused and go hi um yeah it's

1127
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,680
my first hope i just show up this where

1128
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,520
do you go to register to pick up your

1129
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,200
badge

1130
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,880
and they'd just be like and then be on

1131
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
the radio back hi security front front

1132
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
destination are you awake like you know

1133
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,079
cause it's like how did you get in you

1134
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,440
did you what did you supposed to be down

1135
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,640
there you actually walked past security

1136
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
yeah and that's not to [ __ ] on security

1137
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
because they they often went through

1138
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
like like so much horrifying stuff i'd

1139
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,640
hear that like basically by mid-saturday

1140
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,720
they were all dead at that front so yeah

1141
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,040
did you want to say your favorite

1142
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,680
so um

1143
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,200
it's also being recorded for our

1144
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,280
posteriors so yes austerity

1145
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
which

1146
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,440
i mean if you want to be the keynote

1147
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,079
speaker you can

1148
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,880
i would go to that talk

1149
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
that's not even a joke i would go to

1150
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,880
that talk

1151
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,520
so um

1152
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,839
in 2018 i had someone approach the

1153
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,520
disinformation desk

1154
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,319
and he was asking me about av for

1155
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,880
workshops uh for many of you i just got

1156
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,119
a migraine with you saying that

1157
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,000
right

1158
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,640
uh that because that's a skill that's a

1191
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,040
skill neo you you know me

1192
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,920

profits yeah exactly

1194
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,560
um but there was a little bit of a

1195
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,359
problem because my smart i was not only

1196
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
was i info desk um

1197
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,720
for 2016 and 2018. i was also a member

1198
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,839
of the code of conduct team

1199
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,040
i have a little bit i actually wrote a

1200
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,560
whole thing that we're i'm gonna say my

1201
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,160
phone stays alive

1202
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
um

1203
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,359
and the person asking me about av

1204
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,280
support for his workshop was actually

1205
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,040
the head of the code of conduct team

1206
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,640
and we didn't meet in person at that

1207
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,800
point i didn't know what he looked like

1208
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,680
so

1209
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,760
after the train wreck that was 2018 um

1210
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
code of conduct held some

1211
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,359
apparently i just hit 10 000 steps cool

1212
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,680
um

1213
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,800
because i'm italian i'm talking with my

1214
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,760
hands um

1215
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
at one of the postmortems for a code of

1216
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,599
conduct because 2018 was a [ __ ] show on

1217
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,960
multiple levels

1218
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,160
um

1219
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,200

1220
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
off on me in front of a friend who was

1221
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,760
interested in also joining and i had to

1222
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,040
remind him

1223
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200

1224
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,839

every year but amazing but he is like

1232
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,400
usually the one of the highlights for

1233
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,079
our closing ceremonies every year to the

1234
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,280

1236

this year oh my uh

1237
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,160

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,480
there are so many great memories uh to

1239
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,839

1240
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,920
hotel pennsylvania and hope in in

1241

i mean there's the one

1244
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,240
night that i can't remember which is

1245
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
probably the most interesting so uh if

1246
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,760
you have any information about that

1247
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,119
please tell me

1248
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,800
if you have any video information send

1249
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,400
to me first so i have blackmailed and

1250
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
send it to him but but i know like one

1251
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,680
reason

1252
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
i'll tell you what happened okay cool

1253
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
now but a very special moment was when i

1254
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
and nick farr and we both were like um

1255
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,839
20 club mates or something like that and

1256
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,800
we both were wearing cancer and we were

1257
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,280
racing with the segways and on the

1258
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
messenger level yeah and i cannot

1259
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,200
believe that we didn't kill ourselves

1260
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,079
this is just like incredibly lucky for

1261
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,359
both of us that this did not happen but

1262
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,560
uh

1263
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,079
really interesting story concerning the

1264
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,960
hotel rooms is that

1265
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
uh because i stayed i think three or

1266
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,680
four times at hotel pennsylvania and i

1267
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,040
think then i changed to some other

1268
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,280
hotels and the main reason for that was

1269
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
that i dared to take off my socks one

1270
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,079
time

1271
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,599
bad idea

1272
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,480
and i actually got some interesting

1273
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,720
growth on my leg

1274
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,640
because of the

1275
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
carpet or something like that and it

1276
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,040
nearly bankrupted the austrian social

1277
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,640
healthcare system

1278
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,640
because it took three and a half months

1279
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,599
and a variety of different forms of

1280
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,359
drugs to get the [ __ ] growth to stop

1281
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,440
i still they still don't know what it

1282
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,680
was

1283
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,599
i can tell you what it was it was the

1284
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,280
american capitalism it was trying to

1285
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,440
infect your system maybe it was that but

1286
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,760
i mean my main concern uh so my name is

1287
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,720
johannes and i have a problem uh is that

1288
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,599
that

1289
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,680
if hotel pennsylvania is being

1290
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,560
demolished right now i'm fearful of that

1291
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,680
stuff getting into the

1292
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
getting somewhere so

1293
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,200
we should all take measurements there

1294
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,240
and trying to find out

1295
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
danger

1296
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,839
so danger so stopping right here if

1297
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,119
you've seen johannes's um presentation

1298
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,240
yeah yesterday real quick um he does a

1299
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,079
lot of both documentaries interesting

1300
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,680
movies and johannes i think you found

1301
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,319
the plot for your next movie

1302
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,800
for real

1303
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,000
the fungus of hotel pennsylvania

1304
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,680
ever daddy i want you to speak because i

1305
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
have a funny story relating to you but

1306
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,599
go what are you going to say undoubtedly

1307
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,480
at this point they're going to be a

1308
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,160
bunch of funny stories involving me but

1309
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,440
this one actually i have to thank

1310
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
johannes for this back in 2016 during

1311
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,880
the closing ceremonies he had his uh

1312
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
usual colorful demonstration

1313
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,440
and i don't know if anyone else remember

1314
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,200
this but he goat-seed everyone yes

1315
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,800
and here's where it gets better that

1316
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
actually was the first time somebody

1317
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
successfully goat-seed me

1318
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,040
and after that i like followed him back

1319
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,319
to the hotel he was at i and i basically

1320
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,040
said [ __ ] you you go teach me and gave

1321
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,000
him a big bottle

1322
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,000
um so you weren't there for when jello

1323
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,680
biafra mooned the audience because when

1324
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,599
i talk about the maps i woke up to that

1325
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,000
i keep waking up to odd sexual deviant

1326
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
behavior i don't know why it's just it's

1327
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,400
just i mean you slept reversal i think

1328
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,079
that was the year that he had me go at

1329
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,160
4am to find like

1330
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,720
uh duct tape post-it notes and some

1331
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
other weird [ __ ] that you could only

1332
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,520
really con conceivably find

1333
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,960
at 4 a.m

1334
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,040
in the middle of midtown manhattan yep

1335
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,960
so um i'm glad johannes that you brought

1336
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,480
up the segways

1337
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,440
because

1338
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,000
most people remember um the

1339
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,359
mark of the beast that i'm wearing

1340
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,880
circle of hope which for some reason is

1341
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,960
the uh vaccine check so i guess that's

1342
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,400
even more that the circle of hope was a

1343
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,640
disease that so sum it up circle of hope

1344
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,119
was both my third favorite hope and was

1345
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,560
the worst hope i've ever been it was

1346
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
like it's been one of those things where

1347
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,319
it's like 97 of it was literally awesome

1348
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,000
and the remaining three were just so

1349
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,960
awful

1350
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
one is the obvious incident which we can

1351
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,559
talk about later but i keep think a

1352
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,000
feeling that everyone else forgets the

1353
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,160
other incident that i was there to

1354
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,839
witness which was

1355
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,160
the late night uh yeah which public

1356
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,760
details have still not been announced

1357
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,359
about that okay

1358
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,520
but

1359
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,760
not anymore it doesn't know

1360
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,960
well my whole thing is i was going to

1361
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,839
share the thing that um aphrodite asked

1362
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,280
me to do about all that because i'm

1363
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,079
going to

1364
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,680
i'll just quickly go over because this

1365
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,440
is the public thing so i think this is

1366
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,920
fine to share um basically um this is a

1367
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,599
little behind-the-scenes thing i got

1368
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,119
really bored and worried about the

1369
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,359
segways after the first two times i saw

1370
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,040
them at the convention because i'm just

1371
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,760
like

1372
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,839
one like let's do something new with

1373
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,280
them let's replace them with something

1374
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
else and then over all my fields

1375
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,680
eventually you know 90s psa someone's

1376
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,200
going to get hurt and unfortunately at

1377
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,040
circle i hope that did happen so you

1378
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,720
probably may have heard the story if not

1379
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
look it up of the uh

1380
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,359
there was a segway that did have a

1381
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,760
charge in it and someone who had

1382
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,079
probably too much pain go bye-bye juice

1383
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,599
um

1384
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,079
wrote on one and essentially

1385
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,240
uh i guess i'll describe what i saw

1386
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,760
because i literally looked up and i saw

1387
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
it um

1388
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,680
i don't know if he hit the break or it

1389
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,280
tripped on something but he basically

1390
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,359
flew off at full speed backwards

1391
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,000
straight into the wall um to the point

1392
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,160
where i didn't even notice like blood or

1393
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,319
anything i just noticed that he had no

1394
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,319
top of his head

1395
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,720
it was that yeah and you know the

1396
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
amazing volunteers and the the people

1397
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,720
were trained emts at the time ran in did

1398
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
an amazing job but i'm going to share

1399
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,520
this part and hopefully unless security

1400
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,640
runs over and strangles me i'm going to

1401
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,960
share this part so i'm terrified i'm

1402
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,559
trying to help out when i can

1403
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,480
and aphrodite walks over and she's like

1404
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,520
so you yeah i saw the whole thing and

1405
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,640
she's like so you know what's going to

1406
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,200
happen next and i'm just like

1407
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,319
final jeopardy theme playing and i went

1408
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,559
oh yeah they're sending ambulances so

1409
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,800
that means nypd are good friends from

1410
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,599
the roof are going to show up

1411
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,400
and so they're just like yeah um so it's

1412
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,240
saturday night

1413
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,079
and to give you a perspective of what

1414
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,760
saturday night's like one year that

1415
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
wasn't that year working at radio

1416
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
statler my boss had three bottles of

1417
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,960
jameson's he gifted the staff one as a

1418
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,480
communal one for thank you for all the

1419
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,880
work and he double fisted punt semi

1420
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,720
attended both jamison's that entire

1421
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,319
night

1422
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,920
that's how bad it gets with alcohol

1423
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,880
alone

1424
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,800
so i'm glad that was also the year where

1425
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,839
we were given more alcohol than

1426
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,440
we were capable of hiding i love the

1427
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,280
manor or form

1428
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,480
volunteers from attendees from

1429
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,000
i think one of the speakers actually

1430
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
gifted alcohol i mean we were writing

1431
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,960
the best speakeasy in town i love

1432
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,400
that when particularly when press would

1433
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
come by they would look at the crates

1434
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,440
underneath the boots and they thought

1435
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
that was like extra av equipment and a

1436
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
cool hat no it's just all

1437
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,520
all all stuff to replace blood with

1438
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,200
that's all it was alcohol

1439
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,640
so after daddy comes over so she's

1440
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,839
saying you know and i realized oh that

1441
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,119
means police are gonna be here and it's

1442
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,760
like yeah and she's like i don't want to

1443
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
stereotype you because background hat

1444
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,480
black and half polish and she's like

1445
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,760
but

1446
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
people have been you know and

1447
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,440
could you

1448
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,040
very and i knew what she was saying and

1449
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,599
i was like we're an emergency say no

1450
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,280
more fam so i simply walked around the

1451
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
entire mez and any bottle that was

1452
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,079
actually closed i grabbed pitted away

1453
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,920
where i was staying at

1454
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,160
anything that was open even if they just

1455
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,079
opened it i just yanked it out downed it

1456
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,720
and got rid of it

1457
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,680
because i'm known as

1458
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,000
just in case i i think that that i did

1459
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,839
the proper funeral for it and because

1460
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,040
there's pictures of this i just couldn't

1461
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,200
find them uh anymore as uh pouring it

1462
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,800
down the urinals

1463
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,400
oh i've seen because it is

1464
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,520
it's like i'm returning it to its

1465
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,119
natural habitat

1466
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,440
um so yeah literally by the time i got

1467
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,040
to last one that's when the nypd showed

1468
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,079
up and again they looked disappointed

1469
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,520
because they were hoping to like find

1470
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
someone who's like nope dog because the

1471
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,359
thing is is that like i've known to this

1472
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,119
is not a brag it's that i'm known to

1473
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,680
consume alcohol and no one not realizing

1474
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,359
that i've consumed tons of alcohol so

1475
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,079
that's the polish yes that's why because

1476
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,760
i know after i was like i didn't want to

1477
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,559
because she said i didn't want to

1478
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,280
stereotype you because you know

1479
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,880
we're in a crisis so of course i'm going

1480
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,480
to say yes you know

1481
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,720
but yeah that's my whole thing

1482
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,640
is to hide the booze and it was funny

1483
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,839
because i think we got confirmed too

1484
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,280
that it's like we're not gonna have the

1485
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,000
we're probably not gonna have the

1486
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,599
segways next year and then 2020 happened

1487
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,440
so that that was that all the things

1488
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,960
that's fine i'm going to open up again

1489
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,079
anyone want to share more stories

1490
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,680
because i can keep rambling about stuff

1491
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,599
unless yes

1492
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,599
stop a my colleague from radio stat

1493
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,880
there's so much stories by radio

1494
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,319
stattler

1495
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,880
so much

1496
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,960
well part of the segways was the first

1497
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,440
year at radio statler we were the corner

1498
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,720
of where you would turn around the

1499
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,400
segway track so we'd be interviewing

1500
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
like adam savage and stuff and just

1501
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,400
someone every

1502
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,160
minute someone will kool-aid man their

1503
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,480
way through the booth

1504
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
it's like surprise guest this [ __ ] say

1505
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,200
hi

1506
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,319
how many fingers am i holding up yes

1507
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,880
i'll go outside i i first i missed the

1508
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,800
the first bit but was steel mentioned at

1509
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
all

1510
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,000
okay so

1511
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
so so he was a very polarizing person

1512
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,119
but one of one of my fondest memories of

1513
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,400
of hope was

1514
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,160
so there's this guy who who claimed to

1515
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,640
be a former spy and whether he was or

1516
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,720
wasn't it it didn't really matter

1517
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,040
but he would basically take on any

1518
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,800
question that anyone would ask during

1519
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,040
the question and answer period no matter

1520
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,079
how ridiculous it got and he and until

1521
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,440
they kicked him off stage he would keep

1522
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,319
going

1523
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,880
just like me

1524
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,400
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1525
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
ignore the the late late in life

1526
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,680
craziness but

1527
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,640
so

1528
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,480
one of my fondest memories is it's like

1529
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,240
four o'clock in the morning and everyone

1530
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,160
in one of the ballrooms is literally

1531
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,720
like hammered out of their mind you kind

1532
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,880
of start noticing a common time period

1533
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,319
between all the interesting stuff

1534
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,400
happening uh asking him the most

1535
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,319
ridiculous questions and i just like i

1536
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,240
remember like standing up there like

1537
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,839
double fisting and like swaying in front

1538
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,839
of the microphone and i'm asking someone

1539
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,319
who could be my my dad or my grandfather

1540
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,280
to like vividly describe what sexual

1541
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,359
relations are like between spies of

1542
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,800
different countries

1543
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,240
and

1544
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,880
whether he made it up or not the the the

1545
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,200
answers were incredibly entertaining and

1546
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,440
and he feeled every question someone

1547
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,680
brought up until basically a sun came up

1548
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,400
in life

1549
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,079
and like av was like we got to go we're

1550
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,920
not we we can't survive anymore like

1551
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,200
even we need sleep yeah

1552
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,000
that was that was never revealed until

1553
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,240
now

1554
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,640
i actually liked going and watching the

1555
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,920
steel talks

1556
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,079
but at the time i was working security

1557
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,599
and

1558
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,119
we tried

1559
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,319
really hard to organically convince him

1560
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
to stop talking and that method involved

1561
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,160
making sure that his water glass and

1562
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,280
water picture were never empty

1563
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,920
and it still didn't work

1564
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,599
i still remember the one year when we

1565
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,839
let him go

1566
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,319
on and on

1567
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,400
and on

1568
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,040
then the sun comes up see

1569
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,520
and he's still talking at least though

1570
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,079
dead serious about steel at least he was

1571
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,160
like self-aware that he'd go on that's

1572
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,119
why we scheduled him for that um steve

1573
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,119
rambram on the other hand as i like to

1574
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,680
nickname him as steve ramblebram um you

1575
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,720
know i ged cropsway was due he had the

1576
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,040
classic sort of hacker talk where

1577
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,119
and then all the four layer agencies ran

1578
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,440
over and arrested him so i get like okay

1579
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,640
giving him like three hours but every

1580
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,799
year he kept taking up more and more

1581
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,440
time on saturday to the point where all

1582
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,119
i could think about was what amazing ass

1583
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,359
talks that i would have loved to see got

1584
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,359
booted off the schedule just so that he

1585
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,359
can ramble about the same topics he's

1586
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,400
been doing for the past five cons

1587
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,319
that was talking about the expansion of

1588
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,960
the universe

1589
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,160
you're breaking up

1590
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,280
what was the name of this like crazy uh

1591
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,480
private investigator guy like was it ram

1592
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,359
bet yes that was random have you been

1593
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,440
mentioning them on the left

1594
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,430
that guy [ __ ]

1595
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,680
[Music]

1596
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,040
i think that's going to be the sequel

1597
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,960
panel for this and that the next hope is

1598
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,680
that insert that guy is the guy around

1599
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,920
but like is he still doing [ __ ] half of

1600
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,799
it would be about me i don't know i

1601
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,000
don't care okay yeah yeah

1602
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,880
oh my um speaking of uh let's actually

1603
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,240
talk about like keynotes and talks that

1604
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,400
we actually liked um

1605
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,480
i even like one of my favorite things

1606
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
about hope that i'm glad that the po

1607
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,640
also just going back to the hotel

1608
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,880
a weird analogy i've realized that we've

1609
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
reached this point now and i hope i can

1610
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,160
make this analogy is that hotel pen even

1611
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,520
though it's getting demolished that's a

1612
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,000
different reason i feel like has become

1613
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,520
to hope

1614
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,079
as the alexis park

1615
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,680
was to defcon now where that was the we

1616
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,520
were younger and crazier and we can't

1617
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,280
believe they let us go away with all the

1618
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,240
stuff we did and so we like that it's

1619
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,160
kind of safer and secure now but we also

1620
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,599
just miss being crazy because we have

1621
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,319
like actual responsibilities now

1622
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,280
growing up sucks yes so just also a

1623
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,040
shout out to like the st that's the

1624
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,200
staff who just like it was

1625
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,640
sometimes i almost felt like it was like

1626
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,359
odd abuse we would just be like um so

1627
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,720
yeah we have we have a keynote speaker

1628
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,240
he likes painting with his feces and be

1629
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,319
like yes yes just here's the number for

1630
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,480
cleanup yes you know like

1631
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,240
i'm just shocked

1632
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
because there was one year where someone

1633
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,400
had volunteered to be the janitor for

1634
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,920
the three different bathrooms that we

1635
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,520
had available

1636
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,280
dressed as a clown

1637
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,400
and i never found out who i could thank

1638
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,520
for taking on the dirtiest dingiest

1639
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,280
least enjoyable job in all of hope

1640
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,040
and radio style yeah also if i remember

1641
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,400
correctly neil i don't know if you

1642
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,920
started this or one that people are

1643
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,040
helped but

1644
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,799
the later parts of the con

1645
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,559
i'm so glad this got made was it was

1646
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,960
called the underground shower network

1647
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,720
which was if you did not have a hotel

1648
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,079
and you needed to shower there would be

1649
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,200
people who would offer your rooms or

1650
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,720
they'd mod obviously they won't watch

1651
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,280
you shower that costs extra as liz says

1652
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,319
but

1653
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,839
you could go and take a shower inside

1654
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,359
the room and clean it i'm so glad

1655
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,799
because i can tell you how that started

1656
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,240
uh that actually started because of the

1657
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,319
hammocks the fact that the hammocks were

1658
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,400
located in a central area

1659
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,119
with very poor circulation

1660
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,680
meant that body odor would continue to

1661
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,960
increase um you mean reproduce

1662
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,880
night owl and i had a great idea one

1663
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,480
year just hosing people down while

1664
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,559
wearing hazmat suits because it was much

1665
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,599
easier

1666
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,680
than convincing them to take a shower so

1667
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,920
the underground shower network came from

1668
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,400
that funk what spook's staff was gonzo

1669
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,559
and i uh used to another friend of mine

1670
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,079
used to pitch every

1671
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
hope that we would do a thing where we

1672
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,079
would find another third party and all

1673
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,680
three of us would dress in hazmat suits

1674
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,599
and we would make a uh

1675
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,920
um a tiled drain area of the portion of

1676
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,319
the mezzanine and basically if someone

1677
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,000
has too much funk they could like

1678
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,599
silently report to us like we're the

1679
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,960
stink secret police and run over like

1680
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,040
grab them with one of those like extendo

1681
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,799
collar things drag them over to that and

1682
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,720
i think it was like high powered hose

1683
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,880
for soap how pirate hose through water

1684
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,359
and then a giant leaf blower and then

1685
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,599
like clear them and send them off so

1686
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,720
when they said underground shower

1687
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,480
network i was like thank you because

1688
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,559
that was our version of making the dirty

1689
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,559
joke so bad that the

1690
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,160
le the least

1691
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,839
horrifying one that we originally wanted

1692
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,240
to do would go off so i'm glad that

1693
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,720
happens to have the other thing um yes

1694
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,919
so i've got i've got messages

1695
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,359
i have messages from a hope alum friend

1696
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,839
and uh they have asked me to remind you

1697
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,119

1698
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,760
coin op dong flowers i miss those

i miss when we had those art displays we

1700
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,920

1701
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
itself i know we keep going there's

1702
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,480
other hopes we're going to talk about in

1703
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,240
a second but yeah that's one thing i

1704
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,920
remember i have a picture actually what

1705
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,359
i can do is wait was it 2018 or 2000

1706
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,319
whatever this was 2008.

1715
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
go together okay

1716
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,479
yeah

1717
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,920
i don't know how we can convince saint

1718
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,200
john's if whatever if we could do this

1719

but i would love to have them back

1720
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,160

1721
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,240

1731
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,119
dragged onto oh my god the amd project i

1732

remember playing that sports code so um

1733
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,280
quick background about like the

1734
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,240
difference you're naming all these

1735
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,559
projects i created

1736
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,040
this is the lexicon you created

1737
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,839
you created it we'll talk later

1738
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,359
see statues of limitations now we know

1739
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,000
get him no um what i wish i could load

1740
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,599
is and you can still find this because

1741
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,440
it's archived i

1742
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,000
it's not by 2600 there's a separate

1743
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
youtube channel that hope staff have

1744
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,520
forgotten about that has some of the

1745
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,599
earlier promo videos and there's still

1746
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,160
the open amd they made like a trailer

1747
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,280
for it

1748
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,760
uh to the point where my good friend who

1749
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,839
i really wish could be here i couldn't

1750
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,359
make it due to multiple reasons rob t

1751
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,119
firefly was in that saying the amazing

1752
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,440
line what is hope amd and i literally

1753
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,119
screenshotted that printed it out

1754
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,559
brought it to hope and i forced him to

1755
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,240
like autograph it so like just in case

1756
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,640
you become famous i have the first

1757
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,880
but yeah this was an interesting project

1758
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,200
it was originally from mez in 18th floor

1759
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,039
and basically the electronic badges that

1760
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,599
year had a rfid system with

1761
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,000
a billion different routers i mean now

1762
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,079
we can just use google voice and google

1763
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,920
map to track where everyone is

1764
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,160
literally but um and you would be able

1765
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,640
to see as this map where everyone went

1766
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,680
um on the last day of the last three

1767
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,359
hours of the last day of the con when

1768
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,240
everything actually worked

1769
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,160
then we get dmc dave hello

1770
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,440
i also love the h2k hat

1771
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,440
we also had some very interesting up and

1772
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,240
down

1773
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,880
up and down but like badges each each

1774
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,559
year sometimes they were just

1775
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,640
slightly

1776
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,960
our current one which i do have to ask

1777
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,319
like i do like this design but what what

1778
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,240
was it where this badge every time you

1779
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,079
tried to pee at a urinal it blocks your

1780
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,079
dick

1781
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,640
it's like you know the new laptops where

1782
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,160
they have the little like shutter cover

1783
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,920
for privacy it's like that's that i have

1784
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,240
to like move that out of the way

1785
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,559
go out of incognito to public mode and

1786
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,920
then go back

1787
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,640
oh

1788
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,319
question of the audience how many of you

1789
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,119
have brought your old hope badges

1790
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,280
anyone we should have advertised that

1791
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,799
[ __ ]

1792
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,319
probably the most one of the most famous

1793
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,160
ones was if i more quickly it was i

1794
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,039
think it was h2s either h2k h2k2 where

1795
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,280
it was both a sim card and a mag stripe

1796
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,440
yes

1797
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,920
can we turn the mic on

1798
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,200
oh i didn't know if that was i thought

1799
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,399
that was another av

1800
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,799
so the badges

1801
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,799
let's see if i can get them right

1802
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,559
h2k

1803
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,760
and and h2k2 both had a mag stripe car

1804
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,079
with a barcode with a with a chip on

1805
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,520
with smart card kit the first hope

1806
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,680
badges i think were just plain stickers

1807
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,839
yeah that sounds right yeah at h2k those

1808
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,160
were all actually printed

1809
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,079
off of a similar machine to what would

1810
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,680
be used to have printed old driver's

1811
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,440
licenses

1812
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,480
h2k2 were all professionally printed and

1813
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,400
for those who don't who weren't there or

1814
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,880
don't recall it there was a color scheme

1815
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
that was based on the then new homeland

1816
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,960
security color coding list

1817
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,119
regular attendees were low risk at blue

1818
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,119
then it went to press at orange uh

1819
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,359
i forget the i think it was uh like

1820
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,319
volunteers at yellow security had orange

1821
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,400
and then the core team would have red or

1822
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,000
highest threat

1823
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,280
uh

1824
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,960
hope number five

1825
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,119
was the buttons

1826
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,640
uh hope six was the entire armband thing

1827
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,559
which had a big by the way the the

1828
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,319
buttons had the big thing where everyone

1829
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,480
had different numbers on there and the

1830
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,839
big question was who is number one

1831
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,440
[Applause]

1832
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,880
are you being strangled what's going on

1833
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,240
i'm trying to remember the rest of them

1834
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,319
right now but it's

1835
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,680
i was looking for the old badges but

1836
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,920
after six um i think i remember them

1837
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,680
yeah i just i was looking for my old

1838
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,880
badges because i

1839
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,240
out of habit you know whenever you show

1840
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,520
up to these conferences you bring the

1841
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,680
old badges and people would ask oh [ __ ]

1842
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,960
were you there for this one were you

1843
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,640
there for that one do you remember the

1844
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,480
time and you would remember things about

1845
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,680
the hotel

1846
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,599
through those badges they were mementos

1847
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,319
of the time uh one of them

1848
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,520
i want to thank i don't know who the

1849
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,960
hell it was from the eff who thought it

1850
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,160
was a great idea to go up to the roof

1851
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,760
like it was defcon because that's how i

1852
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,720
got a complete set of that year's badges

1853
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,919
when their badges were taken

1854
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,280
uh hope nine by the way was pretty

1855
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,599
distinctive it was a

1856
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,920
remastered version of the hackerspace

1857
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,119
passport

1858
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,000
i hope 10 were patches the kind that you

1859
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,920
would which one on it by the way the

1860
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,160
passport one is my favorite badge just

1861
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,640
because every area and certain people

1862
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,240
had like stamps like you would go

1863
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,520
through different so it was just a fun

1864
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
pokemon like you tried to complete your

1865
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,799
i thought that was a great way to get

1866
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,640
everyone involved at different levels at

1867
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,760
the con who would normally not get

1868
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,520
involved in certain things two easter

1869
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,680
eggs in that passport were that where

1870
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,440
you were from was listed as one two

1871
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,520
seven zero zero one

1872
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,240
and the expiry date was on the day that

1873
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:22,960
the

1874
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,559
that the 32-bit epoch would end

1875
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,079
um then

1876
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,839
let's you know remember um then 11 we

1877
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,760
had badges like this that looks like you

1878
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,200
can see behind this are you writing this

1879
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,280
documentation

1880
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,039
from what i understood with the badges

1881
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,160
for

1882
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,880
the 11th one was because i was a bit

1883
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,079
behind the scenes we were talking about

1884
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,640
so much amazing stuff and then i didn't

1885
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,240
hear from them for a while and i saw

1886
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,000
that badge and basically answer i was

1887
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,920
told was we ran out of time and gave up

1888
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,880
so we just made these

1889
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,880
anyway it happens

1890
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,240

1907
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,680

1909

thank you to whoever found them oh yeah

1911
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,920
one of the traditions by the way that

1912
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,720
they keep the um ending um the closing

1913
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,200
ceremonies is the security coming by

1914
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,280
with the haunted cardboard box of things

1915
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,799
people have lost which has include

1916
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,000
multiple ids credit cards glasses

1917
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,119
children just all sorts of stuff

1918
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,720
there's one particular memory that i'm

1919
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,520
not going to share but uh

1920
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,319
uh

1921
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,319
and now you're sure

1922
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,559
i remember that and you and i both know

1923
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,559
that you're not going to talk about it

1924
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:13,839
we're not going to talk about it we're

1925
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,440
not going to talk about that incident at

1926
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,399
all we're going to talk about a

1927
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,158
completely different one where security

1928
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,640
had gone up for the closing ceremonies

1929
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,040
um and i was the last person at security

1930
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,600
desk and we had to call security back

1931
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,759
someone who had been ejected

1932
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,238
you have never seen security come down

1933
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,279
18 flights to the mezzanine as pissed

1934
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,238
off

1935
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,238
ever and i think that was also the year

1936
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,158
that one of them wanted to retire and he

1937
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,158
was about to retire when he was called

1938
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,120
back into service

1939
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,080
uh other stories i'm i'm still taking a

1940
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,000
look through the chat that's fine

1941
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,839
i will make a note about security

1942
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,520
because security really gets the because

1943
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,920
again security at a hacker convention

1944
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,319
and then security at hope

1945
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,719
with all of the different

1946
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,479
ideas and

1947
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,560
chemicals going around

1948
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,359
um

1949
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,759
trying to think oh so there's a do you

1950
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,679
have one or can i tell a quick one here

1951
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:12,880
tell yours i've got one queued up

1952
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,000
awesome um so this one because i don't

1953
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,520
care about i guess how much i dox about

1954
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,920
myself um i have a funny story of how i

1955
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,880
actually got promoted at radio statler

1956
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,120
it actually has a real story so

1957
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,719
we're radio statler so there's no we

1958
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,040
used to have a pop-up like radio station

1959
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,040
we would form it as the mezzanine would

1960
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,920
develop

1961
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,759
and uh would stop stape and a bunch of

1962
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,920
other friends and um

1963
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,600
we would it's basically if you couldn't

1964
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,920
be at the con we were like your ear in

1965
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,238
the con and also we would just

1966
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,520
since we were on the ground floor we

1967
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,880
would get a lot of like breaking news

1968
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,399
and odd things that you wouldn't hear

1969
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,799
from the rest of the convention um

1970
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,640
there's also a rel

1971
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,238
actually now i'll jump into this story

1972
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:53,679
and then we'll tell this one because the

1973
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,440
other one i think this one's more funny

1974
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,360
uh so before i got the promotion i think

1975
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,040
it was the same year one of the

1976
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,880
traditions we would do on friday in

1977
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,960
particular was and i would be asleep

1978
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,440
during this was play various card games

1979
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,760
and odd games in the radio this was the

1980
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,120
beginning of the drinking and one year

1981
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,199
uh a person who

1982
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,199
should not be named after a musical

1983
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,600
instrument um

1984
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,199
i don't know if we should say his name

1985
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,719
but because everyone else has said his

1986
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,239
name but i'm just gonna but he's a good

1987
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,840
friend of mine and i love him he's at

1988
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,320
the calm this year but he was basically

1989
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,719
um so much on the pin go bye-bye juice

1990
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,400
that as they were just playing the game

1991
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,480
we have the audio of this he just sunk

1992
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,719
back in his chair and fell out of his

1993
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,520
chair through the wall and there was a

1994
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,600
hole shaped like his body through the

1995
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,920
wall which is made out of foam to like

1996
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,640
reflect sound that wasn't even yeah yep

1997
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,840
like literally

1998
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,600
that wasn't even the worst part for me

1999
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,120
though so we taped that one up horribly

2000
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,000
the second day

2001
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,159
one of the people in charge of their

2002
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,520
radio

2003
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,360
also got way too drunk

2004
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,600
and fell through the exact opposite side

2005
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,280
that the previous guy did making a new

2006
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,760
hole in the wall

2007
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,560
because that was that thing

2008
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,880
on those walls put in mind we already

2009
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,280
installed and this is true a glory hole

2010
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,120
in the booth

2011
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,800
we don't need any more holes in the wall

2012
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,400
that was the thing there was that and

2013
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,560
people drawing dicks all over the wall

2014
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,840
which as i brought up in our panel

2015
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,360
the majority of the attendees we have a

2016
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,400
lot of amazing

2017
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,360
um

2018
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,040
femme identifying and they in them

2019
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,440
hackers but a lot of them are still cis

2020
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,120
dudes and i'm like do you do you look

2021
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,239
down at your junk do you know what it

2022
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,920
looks like because there was just

2023
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,080
eldritch like there was things that look

2024
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,600
like you fought them in elden ring where

2025
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,360
you're like that's a penis

2026
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,000
do you know what it looks like

2027
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,880
it makes you start to think

2028
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,120
or maybe not but yeah i was wondering uh

2029
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,960
what's the matrix story hopefully more

2030
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,159
wholesome than that and i'll tell how i

2031
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,400
got promoted at the radio i forgot which

2032
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,040
this is from technophobe great name by

2033
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,080
the way

2034
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,920
i forgot which hope it was if i remember

2035
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,960
this is a was 2 2k 2.

2036
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
after the closing event vote folks were

2037
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,640
invited to tear down by picking up as

2038
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,400
much cat 6 as they could from the main

2039
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,920
room as they could carry oh that's how

2040
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,679
you get either muscles

2041
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:12,960
several folks didn't seem to know the

2042
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,159
difference between ethernet and

2043
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,800
telephone cable so a lot of phone cables

2044
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,320
were pulled off of the walls of the

2045
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,320
hotel

2046
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,159
here

2047
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,280
well how else are you going to get them

2048
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,559
to upgrade their infrastructure

2049
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,600
we're we're verizon uh we're here to do

2050
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,120
an upgrade sometime between uh 2 p.m

2051
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,400

2052
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,840
of um

2053
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,320
the radio um when it comes to uh

2054
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,920
pulling cables and stuff and i just

2055
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,280
forgot where that top is there's just so

2056
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,719
many i have so many stories this is

2057
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,920
probably why i can't remember because i

2058
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,199
should just tell the promotion story

2059
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,640
thing while you try to remember i'll

2060
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,239
just point out that one of the best

2061
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,800
parts about hope and the hotel itself

2062
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,199
was set up and breakdown a lot of people

2063
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,560
come in early

2064
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,600
pitching

2065
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,280
i remember crimping cables for the knock

2066
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,120
i remember doing it for radio statler

2067
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,560
running cables i remember the one time

2068
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,239
we had to somehow

2069
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,920
prevent the smell

2070
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,159
of frying bacon

2071
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,000
to get on the

2072
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,640
foam heads of the microphones because we

2073
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,640
were going to return them

2074
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,120
to the place that we not exactly bought

2075
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,400
them from

2076
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,600
and

2077
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,960
it's run by orthodox jews

2078
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,960
and that was the same year that we had

2079
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,880
the cheese show

2080
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,040
and the booth that was so small that if

2081
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,920
anybody felt cold in the world

2082
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,239
the welding hour but that booth was so

2083
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:41,040
tiny and cold and illuminated by one red

2084
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,400
light yes

2085
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,679
then we forgot you're supposed to put

2086
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,800
the red light on the outside of the

2087
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,560
booth not have it on the inside so we

2088
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,120
all look like a bad like uh

2089
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
horror fun house on the inside it was

2090
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,360
the best excuse to go into the mezzanine

2091
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,280
and see what was going on we also had a

2092
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,440
real door that year at the radio booth

2093
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,280
which i think they got rid of because i

2094
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,840
remember dramatically one time i wasn't

2095
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,120
invited to a

2096
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,560
they forgot to invite me to the video

2097
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,480
game talk that was the legit thing and i

2098
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,719
actually kicked the door down as like so

2099
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:09,920
all you see in the background is just

2100
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,280
the door being kicked out and be like

2101
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,040
did someone not invite me to the [ __ ]

2102
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,640
video game panel and i think that's like

2103
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,120
we're not having a door anymore

2104
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,400
yes alex

2105
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,280
um

2106
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,280
so people keep mentioning

2107
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,760
different projects and and things and

2108
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,320
it's making me think about them

2109
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,040
my first hope was h2k2

2110
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,159
um

2111
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,120
and it was amazing it was

2112
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,239
like

2113
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,840
i was in college at the time it was like

2114
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,120
doing a year of college in one weekend

2115
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,280
like you learned that much both learning

2116
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,559
and in substances yes

2117
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,000
and um

2118
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,520
so i i

2119
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,120
really enjoyed that and i came back for

2120
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,440
the next one and um

2121
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,400
then i moved to new york and i helped

2122
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,480
out a lot on the next one

2123
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,560
and then when it

2124
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,239
came around time for

2125
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,679
what would be the fourth hope that i

2126
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:04,960
would attend

2127
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,120
i had a lot of ideas because i'm a

2128
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,360
person who sees systems that aren't

2129
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,480
working and says hey let's fix that and

2130
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,520
so

2131
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,560
um

2132
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,800
we didn't have an information desk and

2133
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,600
people kept asking security

2134
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,400
for

2135
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,360
uh information and security didn't

2136
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,280
either didn't have the information or

2137
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,239
didn't want to answer questions

2138
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,199
and

2139
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,560
then

2140
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,679
i noticed that you would go to talks

2141
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,679
and

2142
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,960
there are all these people that are

2143
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,199
listening because they're interested in

2144
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,360
a subject and there's one person talking

2145
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,679
and maybe two or three people get to

2146
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,840
ask questions at the end but you don't

2147
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,360
get to connect

2148
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,520
with the other people in the room

2149
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,200
and

2150
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,520
[Music]

2151
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,120
then

2152
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,000
there was this disconnect between

2153
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,840
the mezzanine level

2154
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,800
and the 18 18 floor talks yeah and um

2155
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,199
so i had all this stuff in my head and

2156
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,440
als also um

2157
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,679
the the big open space with the high

2158
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,679
ceiling on the mezzanine level kept

2159
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,480
being used as a like a concert space

2160
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,719
and the acoustics in there were just

2161
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:17,920
awful

2162
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,840
and

2163
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,360
um so i got involved in helping to plan

2164
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,960
uh

2165
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,800
what was the last hope

2166
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,800
and got on the course staff and and was

2167
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,560
involved in um

2168
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,400
so at one point there wasn't really a

2169
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,360
map of the mezzanine so i drew one

2170
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,840
and i inserted some things

2171
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,120
that included

2172
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,040
an information desk which i labeled the

2173
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,280
disinformation desk

2174
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,400
and

2175
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,199
it included radio statler

2176
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,040
which was supposed to be that connection

2177
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,520
to the 18th floor that that became a

2178
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,760
completely different thing

2179
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,040
because

2180
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,960
at the same time i

2181
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,520
had the idea for the attendee metadata

2182
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,560
system the amd project and um originally

2183
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,159
it was going to be like an hour where

2184
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,480
we'd have like tables and there'd be

2185
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,400
different colors of string

2186
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,080
and they'd be associated with different

2187
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,600
subject matter at the conference and

2188
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,760
you'd go and you'd pull the strings and

2189
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,040
you'd like tie them to your badge and

2190
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,320
you walk around and people would then

2191
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,080
know oh that person's interested in lock

2192
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,440
picking and i can talk to them about it

2193
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,719
and everyone's like how can we make this

2194
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,080
ridiculously more complicated than

2195
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,719
actually yeah so i i posted this onto

2196
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:29,600
yes

2197
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,920
yeah we had a forum for a while

2198
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,800
um thank you aesthetic and uh

2199
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,320
then uh pyro when i proposed the amd

2200
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,880
things said well what about rfid and i

2201
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,480
had to look up rfid i didn't know what

2202
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,840
that was

2203
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,360
and uh

2204
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,679
so that seemed like an interesting way

2205
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,280
of solving the problem

2206
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,320
um

2207
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,679
i'm not an engineer i'm an artist

2208
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,600
i understand how technology works but i

2209
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,440
have a learning disability where i can't

2210
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,560
remember

2211
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,120
strings of information

2212
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,920
so i can't program

2213
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,520
and

2214
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,199
so i can't copy information from one

2215
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,199
place to another i will give credit

2216
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,280
where it's due i mean you helped launch

2217
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,960
a lot of things you gave birth to a lot

2218
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,920
of ideas that started becoming hope

2219
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,080
standards and things that we would build

2220
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,600
into the conference so for germination

2221
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,280
keep at it because you've been hacking

2222
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,040
these ideas for years i'm glad we

2223
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,719
finally got the name pyro out there

2224
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,360
because he's been

2225
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,840
in the in the attempt to conserve the

2226
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,719
hotel uh i mean i remember one black

2227
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,560
friday just walking up and down hotel

2228
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,719
pancake save the hotel panthers did a

2229
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,040
whole protest yeah construction

2230
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,880
absolutely remember what happened to

2231
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,000
penn station and it was uh

2232
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,159
friendships were made that way and a lot

2233
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,159
of philosophy uh took place at the

2234
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,920
disinformation desk when there was a law

2235
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,679
hour people would come up and say you

2236
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,120
know how do i get started in hacking i

2237
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,239
said you just

2238
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,560
you know sit down tell me your questions

2239
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,800
and we would have amazing conversations

2240
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,400
especially hope ten

2241
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,719
was just a fantastic back and forth

2242
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,320
ideas uh hope 11 when we held 11c's on

2243
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,960
hope 11. i have a picture

2244
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,480
it was it was one of the

2245
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,040
really one of the i think the apex of

2246
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,640
that whole conference

2247
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,040
was just sitting down with friends

2248
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,120
uh from near from far people you haven't

2249
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,400
seen in years you can't remember their

2250
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,880
damn name but you recognize their face

2251
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,679
and coming together at this one building

2252
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,440
which

2253
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,360
was nothing significant it was nothing

2254
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,600
worth saving you know on its own there

2255
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,159
was no great significance there but

2256
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,239
when you add it all up all the little

2257
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,000
pebbles added up to once you got

2258
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,239
gigantic boulder the size of a boulder

2259
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,400
and we carry it with us

2260
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,320
i think the best way to summed up right

2261
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,640
now is also just to like give a round of

2262
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,960
applause for both lex and pyro not only

2263
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,560
lex for doing a lot of the

2264
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,000
infrastructure but

2265
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,159
again pyro for all of his efforts as

2266
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,600
well as for the safe hotel pen which a

2267
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,440
lot of the images and stuff that i

2268
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,360
showed in the short presentation

2269
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,560
uh came

2270
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,280
uh from those uh

2271
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,080
so uh if i could are you

2272
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,320
are you done you have more well i i was

2273
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,440
gonna say

2274
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,280
i'm gonna just load pictures up while

2275
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,440
you talk you know

2276
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,520
there's a fairly small

2277
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,880
core staff

2278
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,360
that does this every time

2279
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,679
um and because it takes place every two

2280
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,440
years

2281
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,159
we have a gap of institutional memory we

2282
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,080
forget what we did last time

2283
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,040
um

2284
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
starting to get better at that they're

2285
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,880
systems that we've gotten from ccc that

2286
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,440
that seem very helpful

2287
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,040
but everybody who comes to the

2288
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,199
conference can also participate in the

2289
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,520
conference and and pitch in and you can

2290
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,920
send ideas i mean this is the first time

2291
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,000
we've had access to this space and if we

2292
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,760
do it again here

2293
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,000
we should have learned something about

2294
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,080
what to do with this space and what

2295
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,719
didn't work and you know you should send

2296
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,080
your ideas into the team maybe not this

2297
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,440
week because they'll be dead on monday

2298
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,800
well they'll be done on tuesday because

2299
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,040
they still have to break down

2300
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,639
but

2301
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:16,000
yeah it all comes from the community and

2302
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,320
that's a really important part of hope

2303
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,120
is that

2304
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,800
it's it's a make your own conference

2305
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,920
conference

2306
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,520
i don't see my coffee pot there that

2307
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,120
must have been an early one it's a super

2308
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,120
early one you can also see night owl

2309
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,440
trying to just be like don't bother me

2310
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,800
so yeah

2311
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,000
so that the

2312
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,320
the dis info desk which they didn't get

2313
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,880
the name right on the sign uh

2314
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,520
that's how you know it's a

2315
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,880
disinformation desk they already screwed

2316
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,639
up the information great job

2317
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,600
so um we were loading in the the tables

2318
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,600
when we were setting up um

2319
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,239
for the fifth hope uh for the mezzanine

2320
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,920
and um

2321
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,639
i had changed the map so that the vendor

2322
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,600
area took up half of that high ceiling

2323
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,719
space

2324
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,800
so that it wasn't big enough to have a

2325
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,480
concert area

2326
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,360
so the noise level would be down

2327
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,960
and

2328
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,639
thurman who had just started going to

2329
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,239
the 2600 meetings

2330
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,080
walked up to me and said hey what can i

2331
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,239
do and i handed him the schematic and

2332
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,360
said make this look like this

2333
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,920
and he said what me no

2334
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,520
grab people

2335
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
and so uh thurman started grabbing

2336
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,960
people and and then uh he got the vendor

2337
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,040
area set up the way the diagram looked

2338
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,320
and he said what else can i do and i

2339
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,159
said well um

2340
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,000
we have an information desk but we don't

2341
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,159
really have anybody running it

2342
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,320
and so thurman started running the

2343
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,480
information desk and then people started

2344
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,960
coming toward thurman and and it became

2345
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,960
the snowball thing where now there's a

2346
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,320
kind of a community around the

2347
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,760
information desk

2348
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,440
and that's really the spirit of hope

2349
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,800
right there that was the spirit of the

2350
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,639
world people just randomly are being

2351
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,400
like this is [ __ ] what i would do

2352
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,400
and oh i can actually do it okay or just

2353
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,040
like it's like you make this pretty go

2354
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,679
so it's a lot of who me

2355
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,320
and suddenly you think yeah

2356
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,080
yeah that's how you become part of staff

2357
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,880
yeah

2358
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
um

2359
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,239
so my

2360
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,520
my

2361
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,560
uh

2362
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,120
statute of lamentations is past hope

2363
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,639
story

2364
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:15,440
is

2365
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,440
that

2366
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,760
up fbi the after party is after the show

2367
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,719
um

2368
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,080
i was hanging out with uh redacted in

2369
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,440
koreatown

2370
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,400
and um we're having korean barbecue and

2371
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,360
uh reacting a text from uh redacted who

2372
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,920
was hanging out with redacted

2373
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,639
and

2374
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,400
they were um

2375
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,239
at hotel pennsylvania which if you know

2376
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,480
where koreatown is it's a block from

2377
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,840
hotel pennsylvania so we walked over

2378
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,040
and

2379
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,320
redacted who's from uh philadelphia and

2380
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,280
you may know from off the hook

2381
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,800
was interested in some sort of

2382
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,199
electrical panel like a

2383
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,120
decommissioned electrical panel that was

2384
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,520
supposed to be really like elegant like

2385
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,000
1919

2386
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,920
era electrical panel that was somewhere

2387
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,120
in the basement there was some sort of

2388
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,280
control system that's completely

2389
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,280
decommissioned and cut off but but

2390
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,800
wanted to see it and probably get a

2391
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,920
picture of it and so we

2392
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,199
went down

2393
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,040
into the bowels of the hotel

2394
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,920
pennsylvania looking for its original

2395
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,440
power matrix

2396
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,960
back from

2397
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,560
when it was really new um

2398
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,880
and one of the most interesting things

2399
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,520
that happened to me during when we were

2400
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,520
doing save hotel pen was that pyro got

2401
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,280
digital copies of the original

2402
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,280
blueprints of the hotel

2403
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,800
and if you look at the original

2404
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,520
blueprints of the hotel

2405
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,880
it's a rectangular shape above ground

2406
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,639
but underground

2407
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,440
it's shaped like a ship

2408
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,840
it has a point at one end

2409
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,960
um

2410
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,840
and

2411
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,040
it also functions a lot like a ship in

2412
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,320
in that 1920s 30s

2413
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,840
era

2414
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,080
it was one of those fabulous new york

2415
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,880
hotels that you see in the old movies

2416
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,920
um

2417
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,560
it was the hotel statler and if you

2418
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,120
think of statler and waldorf from the

2419
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,560
muppets that's because the statler was

2420
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,960
almost a twin of the waldorf astoria and

2421
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,120
and the hotel statler went downhill and

2422
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,199
the waldorf astoria got sold to the

2423
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,159
chinese

2424
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,760
condos but it was a lot more fancy

2425
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,440
but they were very connected um and

2426
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,000
they had these kind of systems

2427
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,159
where um

2428
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:45,440
the

2429
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,880
there were all these restaurants in

2430
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,199
there and and there used to be the cafe

2431
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,400
rouge which

2432
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,840
um is where the pennsylvania 65000 song

2433
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,400
was played by

2434
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,159
glenn miller

2435
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:01,199
yep yeah glenn miller um

2436
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,919
and um

2437
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,040
so

2438
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,520
back to the story

2439
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,520
we went down

2440
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,239
basically into the bowels of the ship

2441
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,679
and

2442
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,120
redacted from philadelphia

2443
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,000
was not shy about pushing on doors

2444
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,800
including doors that felt a little stuck

2445
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,080
yeah and uh

2446
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,080
at one point we went down a ladder

2447
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,719
because there weren't stairs

2448
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,320
and um then at one point we saw a pit

2449
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,400
and there was water at the bottom but we

2450
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,920
couldn't see it because our flashlights

2451
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,199
wouldn't reach it

2452
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,320
and that was weird

2453
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,000
and um

2454
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,199
well we were using the flashlights on

2455
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,800
our phone so they aren't that powerful

2456
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,280
but um

2457
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,199
so we we got down there and there was

2458
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,120
this one room

2459
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,199
and i'm pretty sure because we weren't

2460
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,639
looking at the schematic while we were

2461
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,480
down there but i'm pretty sure it was

2462
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,440
like the bow of the ship kind of shaped

2463
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,280
point on the lowest level

2464
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,760
because the room went into a point yeah

2465
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,080
like shrinks yeah but it also

2466
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,040
the floor went upward

2467
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,239
and so

2468
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,080
you walked in and the room was normal

2469
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,600
height but if you went to the other end

2470
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,880
of the room it was about three feet high

2471
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,960
and that was weird

2472
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,239
um

2473
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,239
but it's its own universe down there

2474
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,000
basically yeah

2475
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,840
and some of the surface tunnels

2476
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,560
there was a hundred years of

2477
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,679
um

2478
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,159
decay on paint in rooms that hadn't been

2479
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,480
painted since 1919

2480
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
and that was interesting just like the

2481
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,639
the textures of the walls and everything

2482
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,880
and we were using our cell phones to see

2483
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,080
a lot of this stuff because the lights

2484
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,440
weren't on in a lot of the places we

2485
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,320
were in

2486
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,639
and so we rambled around and rambled

2487
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,400
around

2488
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,440
and

2489
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,920
eventually we got to a door

2490
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,360
we went in

2491
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,080
and it was like a nightclub out of the

2492
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,080
80s

2493
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,400
and there were all these weird color

2494
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,600
squares on the walls

2495
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,040
but it also looked like it hadn't been

2496
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,800
used in a while

2497
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,880
but like as a club but it also looked

2498
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,639
like people had been in there fairly

2499
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,280
recently and we think maybe the staff

2500
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,239
had like used it as a hangout

2501
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,520
um

2502
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,280
and if you want to know where this room

2503
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,960
actually was when you

2504
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,920
went into the um

2505
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,800
the expo area where where you go up the

2506
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,719
escalator to the mezzanine you pass a

2507
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,199
little staircase that goes down

2508
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,000
and what we realized was that the door

2509
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,679
to that club

2510
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:43,440
was that door at the bottom of the

2511
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,880
stairs that was always locked and we

2512
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,080
could never see what was inside so we

2513
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,040
were actually in there

2514
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,280
and then we found another door and we

2515
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,360
could hear the subway

2516
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,120
and

2517
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,800
then redacted

2518
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,040
uh got very interested in that door

2519
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,199
and

2520
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:06,080
opened it despite it being nailed shut

2521
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,679
and uh

2522
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,960
a multi-tool was involved

2523
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,600
so we followed reacted out

2524
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,960
the door

2525
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,280
and we were in the subway station

2526
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,880
and then

2527
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,320
redacted who was coming out last closed

2528
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,639
the door very carefully behind us

2529
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,040
and the door locked behind us

2530
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,239
and then we realized that we're inside

2531
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,679
you know how at the end of the night

2532
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,920
sometimes they close sections of the

2533
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,040
subway

2534
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,040
and there are metal gates

2535
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,000
we're inside

2536
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,799
um

2537
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,080
then they've got the spinning iron

2538
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,080
maiden kind of things that they lock so

2539
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,440
they don't spin

2540
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,520
um honestly with the way the basements

2541
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,800
were i wish there's more pictures i

2542
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,560
wouldn't be surprised to find an actual

2543
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,719
iron maiden down there i'm amazed they

2544
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,280
haven't found corpses down there yet

2545
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,000
so um

2546
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,000
what we realized was that you can

2547
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,880
actually

2548
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,920
climb

2549
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,040
the bars of the iron maiden style

2550
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,239
turnstiles um and so we we climbed over

2551
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,920
in view of like

2552
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,880
40 nypd cameras

2553
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,639
and apparently no one was watching the

2554
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,440
cameras because we very quickly exited

2555
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,320
the subway and went to uh the barney

2556
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,080
rock which was across the street and

2557
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,960
had a beer and just kind of decompressed

2558
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,239
after

2559
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,080
what was probably two and a half hours

2560
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,840
in the deep deep bowels of hotel

2561
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,639
pennsylvania uh in places where

2562
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,400
not only were not allowed we really

2563
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,800
should not have gone

2564
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,000
so um

2565
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,360
i'm gonna tell

2566
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,080
just

2567
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,000
because that was that was a great like

2568
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,480
exo like going down

2569
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,760
into the that was almost like a choose

2570
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,360
your own adventure i feel like of the

2571
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,480
description of what the basement was

2572
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,520
like um gonna segue over into two of my

2573
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,960
stories now open up and they're kind of

2574
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,880
related on the same subject one which i

2575
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,400
get to bring up a picture for so as i

2576
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,960
said earlier um let's see if i can find

2577
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,639
this one because i think this is like

2578
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,400
the best description

2579
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,840
of the man

2580
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,880
uh

2581
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,719
my friend murdoch

2582
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,360
consensually assaulting

2583
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,600
one of my other mutual friends as kind

2584
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,120
of a sum up because the whole thing was

2585
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,280
there was the con and then there was a

2586
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,239
murdoch's room

2587
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,679
now this is actually going to be like

2588
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,360
there's a lot of stories i'm not going

2589
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,440
to just even without redact names not

2590
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,800
going to bear stuff i want to tell my

2591
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,360
fun story of literally the strangest

2592
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,520
thing i ever saw in murdoch's room

2593
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,560
because it involves kind of the

2594
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,080
infrastructure of

2595
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,320
the hotel rooms

2596
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,040
so i was he was on the 15th floor at the

2597
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,360
time and i really needed to pee

2598
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,440
and he always offered the room and gave

2599
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,320
me the keys and stuff so i'm like i'm on

2600
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,440
the 13th floor i'll just go up to the

2601
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,040
15th floor hope the elevator doesn't

2602
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,880
plummet and kill me because

2603
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,639
that was also a risk in the hotels

2604
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:57,840
sometimes you would go up on the

2605
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,440
elevator and

2606
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,120
the crazy one it wasn't it was like you

2607
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,880
would go and then would drop a foot and

2608
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,320
then you're like should i just wait till

2609
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,480
it falls or should i try to exit and it

2610
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,639
bisects me you just didn't know

2611
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:09,600
um

2612
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,520
the worst game of elevator action ever

2613
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,230
and um

2614
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,600
[Music]

2615
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,440
so i go to the 15th floor i walk into

2616
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,159
his room and he is just like seemingly

2617
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,880
passed out on the bed like face up i

2618
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,239
take no mind for because i'm used to

2619
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,960
seeing him like that don't ask me why

2620
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,120
walking over past him as soon as i'm

2621
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,199
right about to go past him he snaps

2622
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,880
instantly awake as if possessed and he

2623
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,560
goes don't go in the bathroom

2624
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,679
and so by brain because i'm nuts and

2625
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,320
he's nuts started to think what could

2626
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,719
possibly be in the bathroom that murdoch

2627
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,800
of all people does not want anyone to

2628
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,040
see

2629
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,280
and you know there i had all these crazy

2630
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,600
ideas because i'm like now i wanna so

2631
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,760
i'm gonna walk the bathroom and believe

2632
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,880
it or not

2633
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,800
it wasn't any of the crazy ideas that i

2634
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
had but it really i should have expected

2635
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,840
it but it came so out of nowhere

2636
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,159
that it shocked me even more like i was

2637
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,480
expecting like a gay orgy in there or

2638
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,360
just

2639
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,000
something right but this honestly just

2640
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,520
shocked me and scared the crap out of me

2641
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,080
okay and it's nothing truly scandalous

2642
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,480
open the door

2643
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,800
there are two fully dressed

2644
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,360
con attendees in the bathroom kneeling

2645
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,719
in front of the tub

2646
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,280
because i [ __ ] you not they converted

2647
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,040
the entire tub into a bong

2648
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,920
this is true

2649
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,760
they saran wrapped the top of it and

2650
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,080
they added a bunch of other pcv stuff to

2651
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,199
the pipes so you could hit like a giant

2652
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:40,880
and when they would do it the whole tub

2653
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,920
would vibrate underneath the surround

2654
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,239
so imagine me opening the door

2655
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:48,560
and there's two guys oh you're here

2656
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,920
oh and i just slammed the door i'm like

2657
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,199
no i'm just gonna [ __ ] downstairs i'll

2658
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,320

2685
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,000
was it yeah pulp fiction all night

2686
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,800
because the the guy who gives the

2687
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,800
two hit guys the mission you only saw

2688
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,920
the back of his bald head with a

2689
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,520
band-aid and that's uh he was like can

2690
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,520
you stop bringing those references up

2691
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,080
so anyhow back to this story because

2692
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,760
then i'm almost done with stories this

2693
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,440
is like the big one i can tell

2694
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,760
so this was

2695
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
hope x if i remember yeah this was hope

2696
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,239
x

2697
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:09,119
yep

2698
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:13,040
and i decided that okay

2699
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,199
besides drinking

2700
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,840
i have never done any of the other stuff

2701
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,159
that happens at the con

2702
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,560
so i decided and i'm free to tell this

2703
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,560
but just note that this was years ago

2704
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,880
and i have not done this since

2705
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,800
that i was like as long as it's not like

2706
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,400
a super like i'm not gonna do anything

2707
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,239
that people like to do in florida let's

2708
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,440
put it that way

2709
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,119
and as long as you didn't like inject it

2710
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,440
in you or something i was like i'm going

2711
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,880
to do all the substances

2712
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,560
you was studying hard for a drug test so

2713
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,119
he had to test every drug yep

2714
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,440
and two things happened with that one

2715
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,360
was that all my other friends in new

2716
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,600
york pre-gamed me harder than any of the

2717
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,280
people that hope

2718
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,960
because i have a bad mix of gamer

2719
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,800
friends and drag queen friends and they

2720
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,480
just gave me stuff where

2721
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,639
i would honestly want to list them but i

2722
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,040
actually can't remember all of them

2723
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,639
and then i showed up and then there was

2724
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,360
the big thing which was uh still a

2725
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,800
friend of mine i'm not going to name him

2726
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,040
at the time had the thing i wanted to do

2727
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,600
at hope which is he had a connection for

2728
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,440
acid

2729
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,199
and the problem was

2730
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,719
is that he

2731
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,280
screwed up the doses so i'm already

2732
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,560
screwed up from alcohol and a bunch of

2733
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,119
other things and he was supposed to give

2734
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:29,119
me my beginner thing of 1.3 instead i

2735
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:32,800
got his dose of 2.8

2736
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,400
and

2737
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,840
uh yeah i was not there

2738
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,920
and and the reason i'm saying this was

2739
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,840
stape is he's the only other person at

2740
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,080
radio statler he's dead asleep

2741

2742
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,000

while i'm seeing blue butterflies trying

2763
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,480
to creep into my side vision and talking

2764
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,000
heads that aren't there and crap like

2765

when the whole thing was done i set it

2768
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,320
to music and i'm like guys i don't know

2769
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
how that turned out i'm so sorry because

2770
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,480
i had this plan i did this this and they

2771
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,600
were like

2772
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,719

2773
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,280
yeah why and they're like we we did not

2774
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,840
know when to i thought you just didn't

2775
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,679
like we thought maybe you lacked coffee

2776
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,280
but we didn't i'm like i don't drink

2777
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,320
coffee it gives me the runs and we're

2778
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,119
like

2779
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,920
and i listened back and i was like oh my

2780
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,520
god i sound completely normal and this

2781
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,080
this scares me

2782
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,400
and then he does not belong in a hope

2783
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,719
con one of the boss comes down from

2784
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,280
statler i'm not named just for that and

2785
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,080
he this is hours later i'm panicking and

2786
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,280
he's like

2787
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,440
so i heard you did the interview with

2788
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,600
freebsd right and he's like i'm gonna go

2789
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,119
listen to it now and i'm thinking like

2790
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,040
i'm in big trouble and he has the

2791
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,560
headphones on he sits there and he

2792
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,119
listens to all one hour and 20 minutes

2793
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:32,239
of it

2794
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,920
takes the headphones off and he's like

2795
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,360
you've been a volunteer for the past

2796
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,119
couple of things i'm like yeah and he

2797
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,560
goes

2798
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,239
would you like to do all the interviews

2799
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,719
and help curate the content next year

2800
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,159
i'm like and that's how i got promoted

2801
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,000
at radio statler basically his argument

2802
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,480
was if i could be completely blasted and

2803
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,239
sound completely normal on the radio

2804
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,080
mending it myself

2805
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,520
yay for that

2806
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,440
is my least proudest proudest moment at

2807
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,960
hope

2808
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,840
by far any other stories going around or

2809
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,880
i do have another story from the matrix

2810
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,600
chat that uh looks pretty interesting

2811
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,920
okay if only the matrix i'm not kidding

2812
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,360
when i say we're gonna run this until

2813
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,280
everyone gets tired and i'm skeleton and

2814
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,960
stuff okay

2815
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,920
this is from a person with who whose

2816
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,560
name is pronounced elix and whose handle

2817
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,920
is written in a very cursed way

2818
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,880
at h2k2 we made a fake wi-fi antenna out

2819
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,639
of a soda cup yogurt and a couple of

2820
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,639
straws

2821
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,560
we plugged an audio jack into the bottom

2822
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,119
to a laptop running x radar and an x

2823
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,480
term scrolling hex dump

2824
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,159
some reporter tried to schedule a

2825
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,600
follow-up interview with one of the

2826
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,000
co-creators we had a whole story about

2827
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,840
how the bacteria from the yogurt helped

2828
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,280
it refract the wifi signal

2829
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,040
i remember an old lady on the street

2830
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,719
freaking out and yelling that it was a

2831
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,920
bomb and we had to calm her down

2832
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,920
the pranks at hope conferences um

2833
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,000
they've always been kind of good

2834
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,080
that one i did not know about i just i

2835
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,840
want to thank everybody who's online

2836
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,239
who's sharing these stories um because

2837
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:10,080
h2k too much it's before my time and

2838
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,960
that is very much the spirit of the hope

2839
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,360
kind of folks it's we're going to goof

2840
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,119
off we're going to have fun it's a

2841
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,520
family homecoming for a hacker

2842
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,239
conference that's not as technical as

2843
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,880
say def con or rsa or anything else we

2844
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,800
have a hell of a damn good time and that

2845
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,639
was our place to hang out one things i

2846
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:29,920
like about hope what you definitely see

2847
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,520
the spirit carried over here is just the

2848
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,679
sheer variety of inviting stuff that

2849
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,440
we're all interested of as hackers but

2850
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,800
you wouldn't really consider like a

2851
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
hacker or security

2852
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,560
sort of thing hence why we had like adam

2853
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,840
savage i remember one year i can't

2854
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,600
remember his name but we had the comment

2855
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,080
creator of the boondocks there just

2856
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,840
because we all loved the show and he had

2857
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,199
some very interesting

2858
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,040
social political stuff yes mcgregor i

2859
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,400
bring up this image again because one of

2860
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,760
the other things i like about hope is

2861
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,520
that you can like a lot of other hacker

2862
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,440
conferences but especially hope you can

2863
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,320
come here and just be like i need

2864
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,360
yellow cake and some shoelaces and

2865
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,440
someone inevitably is like i bring the

2866
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,119
yellow cake every year and no one asked

2867
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:10,880
for it and finally someone did

2868
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,760
i gotta include one other thing since we

2869
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,199
have we're talking about you know what

2870
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:16,719
people would bring in

2871
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,560
someone and i don't know who it was that

2872
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,239
i don't remember what they even look

2873
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,480
like at this point brought in

2874
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,960
a plotted out

2875
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,040
complete flow chart diy yes welcome to

2876
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,080
hope what's your problem

2877
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,080
even featured it on boing boing after

2878
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,280
the event that he was the keynote

2879
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,800
i'm glad to say to everybody in

2880
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,159
attendance that copy has been preserved

2881
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:53,360
updated we have it stayed

2882
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,199
nice so a little bit of history is

2883
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,440
sticking with us

2884
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,159
that's something forward

2885
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,679
no that sounds like the con today of

2886
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:09,119
like can you have the thing yesterday

2887
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,639
well nobody tell me these things in

2888
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,080
memoranda i could have had it for you

2889
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,000
all weeks ago that's an example of the

2890
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,520
roof um fun fact i also want to throw

2891
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,600
out there about the hotel um literally

2892
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,000
the hotel itself um

2893
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
because like so

2894
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,360
odd thing don't ask me how i know this

2895
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,840
um

2896
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,239
though exactly so the ho so new york

2897
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,560
hotels if you ever wonder why they're so

2898
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,560
obsessed with the whole you have to have

2899
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,320
your room key card to access the

2900
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,040
elevator it's because they want to curb

2901
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,239
normal parties as well as very exciting

2902
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,560
thrusting motion parties

2903
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,119
and because the hotel pen never ever had

2904
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,040
that system it became a hot spot

2905
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,040
destination for both of those type of

2906
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,320
events

2907
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,080
so if you ever had friends that just

2908
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,320
randomly disappeared during the con it

2909
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,840
might have been because of that and

2910
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,080
again don't ask me how i know this

2911
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,679
the better question is why did you never

2912
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,199
share this information to the people who

2913
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,440
might want it

2914
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,320
so

2915
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,080
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna name names

2916
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,400
here but someone who actually also spoke

2917
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,520
earlier i'm gonna let you guess who um

2918
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,639
he uh

2919
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:15,760
that's the only hint you're gonna get is

2920
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,480
he

2921
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,440
he um oh here's an earlier picture of

2922
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,520
the radio booth that we used to have

2923
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,040
back when we thought making out of wood

2924
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,199
was a great idea

2925
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,719
um

2926
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,760
he uh so years ago i think this was

2927
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,639
i think this actually was h2k apparently

2928
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,239
this happened

2929
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:36,320
a major con attendee was trying to

2930
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,760
organize like an official hope orgy

2931
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,320
and it like it it was a legit thing and

2932
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,639
it almost got off the ground and the

2933
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,719
thing that apparently prevented it from

2934
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,960
happening is the knowledge that it's a

2935
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,080
hacker convention especially back in the

2936
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,440
90s

2937
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,040
people were really good at faking all

2938
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,199
forms of identification so there's no

2939
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,600
way they could confirm that no one was

2940
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,840
not underage there and that's why they

2941
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,800
responsibly killed it

2942
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,880
wait responsibly

2943
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,040
i think that was the one the few times

2944
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,199
we've ever been responsible so

2945
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,520
there were incidents regarding uh

2946
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,159
entertainment after hours that did

2947
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:19,520
occasionally overlapping to the con i

2948
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,960
don't think i want to go any further

2949
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,920
than that

2950
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,719
this is new york i'll put i'll share one

2951
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,000
minor story without naming names there

2952
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,159
was one year where i uh

2953
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,960
aggressively uh consent made out with a

2954
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,600
now really good friend of mine in the uh

2955
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,440
the not the surface elevators but it's

2956
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,480
like the

2957
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,080
the surface area won't go and they had

2958
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,520
stairs there there was like normal

2959
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,560
stairs that you can go up through the

2960
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,679
hotel and then there was the surface

2961
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,119
stairs and elevators

2962
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,280
and apparently when i was doing that i

2963
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,040
missed out that was the year where some

2964
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,960
we had i think that was the first second

2965
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,199
year we truly had sponsors

2966
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,360
which was a whole big escapade thing

2967
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,880
about like hope like why do we have

2968
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,560
sponsors like we're getting crazy it's

2969
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,960
going to turn into defcon the next car

2970
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,159
and um

2971
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,320
and that sponsor bought coasters which

2972
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,080
was a bad idea because essentially

2973
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,080
everyone divided into a two teams and

2974
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,360
had a giant coaster war between the mez

2975
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,280
so there's like one group a large like

2976
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,440
50 plus on one side and 50 plus all the

2977
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,480
all the way on the other side and they

2978
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,600
were trying to hit each other with all

2979
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,960
the coasters that were handed out and i

2980
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,320
think it was last year we had coasters

2981
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,239
that year

2982
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,639
yes so i was like mad because i was like

2983
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:24,639
like my my friend was high it was cool

2984
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,719
but i missed this like it was like the

2985
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,159
one now i felt like everyone else where

2986
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:29,440
it's like i'm usually the one that's

2987
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,480
there when

2988
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,480
like crazy stuff good or bad happens and

2989
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,679
everyone's like i can't believe i missed

2990
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,040
that so that was my version of missing

2991
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,560
something at the con

2992
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,080
does anyone have any other

2993
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,280
does anyone have any other stories to

2994
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,880
tell or are we starting to get pooped

2995
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,880
out

2996
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,600
yeah we want to make sure we can content

2997
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,440
trace

2998
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,960
all of the black mailing

2999
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,119
let me make one last attempt to get to

3000
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,880
get his butt on google duo in that

3001
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,040
oh we're like full in dialing in on this

3002
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,280
[ __ ] did you know one year and i i think

3003
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,040
it might have been beyond hope even

3004
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,119
though it wasn't at the hotel um what

3005
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,719
there was a direct phone connection to

3006
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,000
like i think nick was either on the

3007
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
runner in jail or something like that

3008
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,320
and we called through that on an actual

3009
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,880
dedicated uh line

3010
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,280
okay never mind that uh my friend just

3011
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,040
disappeared for about an hour and we've

3012
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,440
and when we came back he's like

3013
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,440
there's a completely empty floor in this

3014
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,360
hotel yes

3015
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,800
because apparently he got off at the

3016
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,040
wrong elevator went through

3017
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,920
a one-way door without realizing it

3018
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,840
and

3019
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,080
proceeded to

3020
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,520
go on his

3021
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,719
his own merry little escape room of

3022
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,480
adventure for the next hour trying to

3023
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,040
find a way out

3024
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,280
it's like the unofficial escape the room

3025
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,600
that you never wanted to play yes

3026
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,840
yes

3027
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,360
and now we have this gentleman

3028
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,440
okay well i just remember i was actually

3029
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,800
allowed on the roof because i think it

3030
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,679
was h2k that we had the special event

3031
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,600
amateur radio station

3032
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,080
and helped set up that and the hf and

3033
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,600
then i was a little bit disappointed you

3034
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,800
know should have gone to hope or should

3035
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,040
i have stayed home and tried to work the

3036
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,280
special event station

3037
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,280
and so well you got your handheld with

3038
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,760
you yeah yeah so we're on 440. tune it

3039
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,000
to this frequency and i literally worked

3040
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,040
the special event station standing like

3041
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,360
three feet away from the station and

3042
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,040
worked it and got my qsl card and all

3043
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,960
that stuff and sort of it was the

3044
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,800
opposite of the old days of the phone

3045
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,480
freak where you call yourself around the

3046
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,080
world with the blue box setting up

3047
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,800
connections to you know from from new

3048
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,119
york to you the uk and then to go to

3049
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,880
india and then go to china and then go

3050
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,560
across the pacific and then call

3051
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,920
yourself to the phone

3052
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,920
booth next to you and hear the echo as

3053
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,440
it propagates through all that delay

3054
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,719
around the world

3055
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,480
and that was just a little short comment

3056
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,360
i had

3057
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,520
awesome you know you just made me

3058
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,040
realize that like

3059
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,159
one of the things because there's been

3060
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,679
little things i've realized that haven't

3061
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:10,960
happened this year because we've had

3062
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,320
such a huge gap that's happened at

3063
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,320
previous hopes and one of the things i

3064
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,480
realized is that ever since it started i

3065
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,400
think this is the first year since it

3066
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,320
started that we there was no social

3067
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,080
engineering panel

3068
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,520
like there was a workshop about social

3069
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,719
engineering but there was that was the

3070
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,719
staple panel by core staff and emanuel

3071
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:28,400
and we just didn't have one that's what

3072
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,000
i was just about to bring up some of the

3073
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
most memorable things was the social

3074
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,119
engineering

3075
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,400
um

3076
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,320
you can't call it a class

3077
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,560
the experience that you would have is

3078
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,600
they would

3079
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,760
you know call two dominoes and let them

3080
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,639
talk or you know just all kinds of

3081
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,719
i remember quickly my favorite social

3082
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:49,440
engineering one was the one where they

3083
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,560
managed to get a hold uh remotely they

3084
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,800
convinced people to connect them to a pa

3085
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,880
system at a walmart

3086
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,320
and

3087
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,719
kmart yeah and i think this is the like

3088
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,040
like what's the most about chaos i've

3089
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,239
there's such a classic hacker thing

3090
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:05,520
where they patched it and basically

3091
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,360
someone did the voice and i'm gonna

3092
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,119
paraphrase here but it basically were

3093
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,080
like

3094
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,560
attention kmart customers

3095
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,199
we are having a flash special everything

3096
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:18,560
in aisle eight is now free i repeat

3097
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,599
everything

3098
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:22,000
and apparently that we had like act like

3099
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,040
some viewer of like someone was

3100
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,960
monitoring the camera so there we saw

3101
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,960
like every attendee saw dying laughing

3102
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,239
like everyone trying to bum rush the

3103
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:29,920
thing and all the employees going nuts

3104
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,760
so that was one thing i remember i also

3105
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,840
remember the time where they called a

3106
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,760
rival hotel that was like five stars or

3107
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,119
whatever basically to see if they had

3108
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,639
bed bugs and accidentally confirmed that

3109
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,239
they did

3110
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,520
it's like i like you know it's like you

3111
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,040
would say hotel pen has bed bugs and

3112
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,239
even though we have the best bit bugs

3113
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:45,840
all the other because we're in new york

3114
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,920
literally was it this year uh new york

3115
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,520
is now considered the second dirtiest

3116
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,760
city in all of america

3117
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,080
so right behind jersey city right pretty

3118
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,560
much well the whole state itself is a

3119
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,719
city we're just happy to new jersey

3120
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:00,000
thank god we're not staten island i'm

3121
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,280
sorry

3122
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,760
the other uh thing that comes to mind

3123
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,920
that will probably stay with me until

3124
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,080
life is i found out what happens if you

3125
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,119
catch air on a segway

3126
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,080
because

3127
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,000
my mind thought the wheels would

3128
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,560
continue to go like a bicycle apparently

3129
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,880
when a segway gets off the ground the

3130
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,639
wheels stop

3131
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:21,840
and when you hit the ground they don't

3132
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,840
go

3133
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,320
immediately it's a balancing act i you

3134
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,199
know

3135
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,599
i survived but didn't know that was

3136
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:31,679
gonna happen tony hawk pro segway 2

3137
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,599
hotel pen edition and i thought i was

3138
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:34,960
the only one who was ever thrown off

3139
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,800
those things sober

3140
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,040
so uh i guess we're gonna sort of

3141
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,000
semi

3142
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,360
yeah we're gonna like wrap things up but

3143
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,719
we're gonna still talk because i feel

3144
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,239
because i'm getting tired because i'm

3145
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,000
old and sad now um

3146
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,599
go ahead and stop it

3147
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,040
i have a quick thing to say

3148
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,920

or eight in the morning and like we

3152
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,159

3153
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:59,599
see people walking in the contour and

3154
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:00,400
you just

3155
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,320
uh pull people in

3156
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,599
and i remember uh uh one year you know i

3157
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:06,880
was like like seven or eight in the

3158
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,840
morning

3159
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,800
and uh we see like a like a a super

3160
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,920
famous

3161
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,840
phone freak like if you googled freak in

3162
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,679
his name it would come up

3163
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,440
and um we're interviewing just about

3164
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,440
like computers and stuff like we don't

3165
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,800
like to talk about their talks but like

3166
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,480
about their lives in general

3167
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,080
and he gets a phone call and he answers

3168
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,639
it and it's someone from an indian call

3169
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,040
center saying that he's having like his

3170
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,480
computer was hacked and they need to

3171
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,159
help him fix it

3172
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:35,280
and he was generally concerned that his

3173
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,920
computer was hacked and entertained this

3174
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,480
kind of phone for like 30 minutes while

3175
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,000
we interviewed him yeah the beginning of

3176
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,599
days of staedtler we actually had a

3177
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:45,040
phone you could dial in which was the

3178
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,880
best worst mistake

3179
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,639
for multiple cars oh yeah we had a whole

3180
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,480
audit system for a while yeah and it's

3181
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,920
five o'clock in the morning we would

3182
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,280
entertain people who were listening from

3183
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,080
australia new zealand uh i think we had

3184
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,560
one person from japan one person from an

3185
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,000
unknown location

3186
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,080
we never got antarctica yeah no that was

3187
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,360
the goals get somewhere that was the

3188
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,599
goal we never quite achieved it but it

3189
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,760
also goes to show what hope was i mean

3190
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,520
even people who were you know before

3191
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,880
cope

3192
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,800
people were remoting in and joining the

3193
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,239
conference even if they couldn't be

3194
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:15,520
there physically

3195
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,000
yeah we got every continent

3196
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,480
well except for antarctica yeah i'm

3197
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,679
still waiting for like a penguin or

3198
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,840
something to dial in for that um i'm not

3199
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,119
going to go into too many details but i

3200
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:27,440
will bring up another factoid and if we

3201
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,679
want to do some details because i'm just

3202
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:31,119
concerned about saying stories even

3203
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,560
without names and then people run over

3204
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,800
and strangle me uh one of the most

3205
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,159
interesting things apparently about the

3206
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,320
con was that allegedly

3207
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,639
at the first hope like the actual first

3208
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:43,679
one in 1994 they by design basically

3209
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,560
started the con with no rules

3210
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,280
to some degree so that way every time a

3211
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,719
rule was made there was always a

3212
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,040
horrific story about why that rule was

3213
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,280
made i think the public one that

3214
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,880
everyone knows about because it's been

3215
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,239
said publicly i've seen them say

3216
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,239
publicly so many times was first ever

3217
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,040
rule was no explosives at the con

3218
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,119
and that was apparently from

3219
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,320
some [ __ ] because it's hope

3220
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,320
had roaming candles and was throwing

3221
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,080
them off the roof because everything

3222
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,080
goes to the roof and it wasn't even just

3223
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,119
that one of the candles exploded and cr

3224
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,960
and either cracked or shattered the

3225
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,000
window

3226
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,880
of

3227
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,360
the then girlfriend now wife of who was

3228
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,040
the head of security at the time

3229
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,800
so that that's basically so instead of

3230
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,040
just the usual we're going to murder you

3231
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,960
that was an extra like it wasn't just

3232
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,719
you pissed off you pissed off like the

3233
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:36,320
big person who's now going to kick your

3234
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,360
ass

3235
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:38,400
um

3236
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,239
i also i don't know if i want to go into

3237
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:42,159
details of this even though i could say

3238
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:44,639
in a very non-detailed way

3239
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,880
i was not involved in the way you think

3240
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,040
but i got to unfortunately witness a

3241
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,199
very famous rule uh that was announced

3242
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,840
at the con which is that um all cons

3243
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,440
including this one we're not allowed to

3244
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:58,719
bring any prostitutes at the con

3245
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:03,280
and that has no good therapy again

3246
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:07,440
no from what i understand no um

3247
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,119
i guess i'll i guess i'll try to

3248
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,880
summarize and go into a little bit about

3249
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
what happened i'll leave the end part up

3250
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,719
to interpretation uh because it's not

3251
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,639
what you think it's not that we you know

3252
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,719
but hacks we had another person i

3253
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,639
remember who i dearly missed speaking

3254
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:22,239
here is cable flame speaking about

3255
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:24,080
hacking sex we've had many of those

3256
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,000
along with kit stubs and

3257
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,920
the rest of them uh so it wasn't that we

3258
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,440
were against sex work or anything what

3259
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,679
essentially happened was

3260
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,760
there was a i believe they were a

3261
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,440
first-time attendee

3262
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,480
and they were lonely so they thought

3263
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,880
they'd bring a prostitute to the con to

3264
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,760
have someone there both for that and

3265
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,400
just personal stuff which is normally

3266
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,719
like fine as long as you're not breaking

3267
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,080
everything like the rest staff is

3268
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,480
breaking everything we're good

3269
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,639
yeah and that was the problem the

3270
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,960
problem was

3271
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,000
this guy

3272
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,239
was we've had this thing at hacker cons

3273
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,400
where a lot of people are coming in from

3274
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,480
no-name towns where they were like the

3275
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,480
elitist hacker there and then they go to

3276
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,239
a con like hope

3277
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,560
or defcon or b-sides and get a horrible

3278
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,119
rude awakening about like how big the

3279
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:15,679
knowledge pool is and stuff so this this

3280
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:17,280
this bastard

3281
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,199
thought that he was such an amazing

3282
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:21,360
social engineer that he could somehow

3283
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,440
manipulate the pimp so that he could

3284
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:27,199
have the prostitute for free he couldn't

3285
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,920
that is actually one of the two top

3286
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,080
reasons why i stopped doing security

3287
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,199
yeah

3288
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:35,280
this is also the like absolute heroics

3289
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,360
of the security team and the av staff

3290
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,480
looks like they're gonna throw dives at

3291
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,639
me so this might be the last uh thing

3292
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:41,920
so i guess we're gonna end with a bang

3293
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,239
here so i got to witness this across

3294
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,159
because essentially i saw security like

3295
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:49,040
essentially dragging a dude

3296
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,599
over to essentially being interrogated

3297
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,119
by security and this poor lady

3298
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,239
who was unfortunately roped into this

3299
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:57,760
because i was informed and i looked

3300
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,760
outside to see this the pimp was there

3301
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,840
with two people who you could tell if

3302
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,320
you looked were part of his group where

3303
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,000
by the way they were dressed we knew

3304
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,920
they were concealing weapons and he

3305
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,920
wants this prostitute back and was

3306
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:14,159
willing to essentially fight the hotel

3307
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:16,480
in khan in the worst way possible to do

3308
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,080
that

3309
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,440
that was the whole

3310
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,239
scandal thing so i got to witness going

3311
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:23,760
that whole thing going down they also

3312
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,199
needed me to talk to some people and

3313
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,119
then there was a revelation that

3314
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,440
i don't want to go into that was a

3315
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,520
surprise to apparently including the guy

3316
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,480
who initiated all of this that just made

3317
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:37,280
the whole situation even more worse but

3318
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,280
the end of the story essentially was

3319
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,760
that guy never saw again probably got

3320
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,520
heated into the sun or worse from what i

3321
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,960
understood the girl we managed to um

3322
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,880
contact one of her trusted friends and

3323
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,800
basically someone paid for a train

3324
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,960
ticket to go to some place to just get

3325
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,000
away from all of that and then i was

3326
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,679
statue limitations over on this i was

3327
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,440
part of what was called team distraction

3328
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,119
where we literally looney tude styled

3329
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:02,960
the pimp of just like we don't know he

3330
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,960
went that way i think i saw him we and

3331
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,960
just he just went to a place that was

3332
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,119
nowhere and we never saw any of them

3333
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,400
ever again so

3334
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,040
it was the most critical and best use of

3335
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,719
social engineering ever at a hacker

3336
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,639
conference and there are people alive

3337
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:18,480
today thanks to it unlike what the other

3338
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,639
guy thought of so i guess unless there's

3339
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,480
any more stories because there's so much

3340
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,080
history that unfortunately and then this

3341
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,320
is the key here is that even if we have

3342
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,239
more stuff to tell right now

3343
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:29,360
um

3344
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:33,520
the hotel is go is gone but still being

3345
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,119
demolished but like we can't access it

3346
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:38,119
anymore

3347
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,000
so save the hotel so save hotel pen

3348
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,080
there's still a bunch of stuff on there

3349
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,679
which is where i got a lot from from

3350
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:48,239
pyro and the team there's uh face

3351
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:50,400
there's stuff on facebook or youtube uh

3352
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,159
neos youtube which unfortunately i

3353
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:55,679
couldn't rip in time um he has videos

3354
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,480
when the vernado was having a hearing

3355
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,000
about whether they should tear it down

3356
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
or not which is actually one of the few

3357
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,679
videos because she passed away in 2016.

3358
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:05,599
i couldn't make that one so i had my mom

3359
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,679
go over and read the whole thing i wrote

3360
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,280
which is i lived in massachusetts for

3361
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:12,719
many years and plymouth rock is voted

3362
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,239
every year as the worst landmark and

3363
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:15,599
it's like the lamest one in the united

3364
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,440
states so we're like why is this [ __ ]

3365
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:20,239
thing a landmark somehow the hotel isn't

3366
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:22,159
um so there's all videos about that with

3367
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:23,520
former staff

3368
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,960
and everything

3369
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,280
all there

3370
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,560
so there is a small one they haven't

3371
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,320
just been really active because for a

3372
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,719
while especially now is literally kind

3373
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,639
of just pyro after a while more than

3374
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:41,840
anybody else right what i am hoping for

3375
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,760
and i'm actually gonna we don't need the

3376
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,159
audio for this so i am gonna mute this

3377
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:47,599
temporarily

3378
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:48,880
is um

3379
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,520
i did see that so before they decided to

3380
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,520
like just finally tear the whole thing

3381
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,560
down

3382
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,000
um

3383
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,480
there was this whole video about how

3384
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,639
they wanted to like celebrate one of its

3385
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,320
birthday i think it was like its 90th

3386
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,639
birthday or whatever and like renovate

3387
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:05,920
it and stuff and one of the things that

3388
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,119
they made if i can skip to it is there

3389
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,280
was like a little museum

3390
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,760
area and it would be i know someone has

3391
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,080
a door from the original hotel i don't

3392
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,360
know how they got it but it's in their

3393
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:20,000
storage unit but i would like to create

3394
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,080
like a maybe we could have a village

3395
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,760
every year at hope where it's just like

3396
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,280
a little like this sort of thing where

3397
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,880
it's a chunk of like all the stuff we're

3398
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,480
able to like save them from the hotel

3399
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:29,520
because i wouldn't be surprised if a lot

3400
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,599
of this is like on ebay or in people's

3401
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,520
personal collections and stuff like that

3402
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,040
so that would be a thing

3403
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,480
i would love to see and just following

3404
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,080
up on the videos if you if you do any

3405
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,000
search whether it's duckduckgo or google

3406
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,960
for safe hotel pennsylvania community

3407
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,040
board five and look through the videos

3408
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,960
you will find all those videos and all

3409
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,119
those hearings

3410
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,360
um so yeah and the key i was gonna get

3411
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,119
to is that we don't have access at the

3412
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:55,840
hotel and again it was a dump in its

3413
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,719
later years but it was our dump

3414
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:00,080
and uh

3415
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,560
now we're now we're in queens i don't

3416
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,760
know why

3417
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,280
but we are

3418
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,960
i'm not no i'm not saying it's the worst

3419
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,639
it's we have nowhere else to go i mean i

3420
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,800
know would put up with like thousands of

3421
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,400
hackers every two years

3422
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,239
running rampant going up to the roof

3423
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:16,560
going down to the sub sub sub basement i

3424
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,800
was just using the place as well as we

3425
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,599
found

3426
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:20,960
so we're going to be creating new

3427
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:23,440
memories here but basically even the

3428
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,360
hotel is gone one that's the reason i

3429
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,159
want to do this panel

3430
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:31,440
yeah there's demoing it

3431
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,760
yeah taking it down from the inside out

3432
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,719
yeah

3433
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:37,520
but but it's more of that

3434
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,920
as happy as it sounds our memories of

3435
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,960
the hotel or live with us it lives with

3436
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,239
all the stuff that we said tonight and

3437
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:46,080
every person that attends the night

3438
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,440
right now well

3439
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:50,239
maybe we can organize that later um but

3440
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:53,199
the point i want to make is that like

3441
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,199
you know this is a new hope so it's a

3442
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,719
new beginning so

3443
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:58,960
we're kind of creating new memories and

3444
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,960
that the hotel

3445
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
for all of us who've attended all live

3446
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,360
with us

3447
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,480
we just got here

3448
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,719
and and it's literally being run by the

3449
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,080
man man upstairs

3450
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:15,760
unless we can somehow get the dildos

3451
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,239
sculptures back but yeah um so i'd like

3452
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,000
to thank uh i know there's a ton of

3453
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,599
people there's a bunch of people in here

3454
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:22,960
but thank you for all physically

3455
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,840
attending here and thank you for

3456
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,760
everyone watching on the stream

3457
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,119
for this sort of retrospective thanks

3458
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,360
for being patient as we were setting up

3459
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,199
at the last minute it was really hard to

3460
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,880
make this a funeral but not a funeral

3461
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,320
and i guess the way i'm going to close

3462
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,520
this out because i haven't been able to

3463
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,280
rip this so this is going to be a fun

3464
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,400
adventure where i'm probably going to

3465
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,080
blue screen the computer

3466
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,599
but if you were there oh you're not

3467
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:44,719
using edge oh he's using edge

3468
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,880
it's the first thing i saw

3469
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,960
i live on the edge man

3470
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,520
so if i've entered this incorrectly now

3471
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,000
you think we're gonna do the hotel the

3472
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,760
pennsylvania six five thousand if i got

3473
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,199
here on time we would do that but there

3474
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:58,719
was a really famous way that the last

3475
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:00,480
hope ended thai one start the beginning

3476
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:04,280
of so i think it's

3477
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,719
this should bring it up

3478
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,119
you can thank johannes for this song

3479
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:10,880
that we all dance to and it's up to you

3480
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,280
if you want to dance to it

3481
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,400
but i am going to play it

3482
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,920
so i figured when we had the fake

3483
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,960
funeral at hope that this is kind of the

3484
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,639
as much as i loved pennsylvania six five

3485
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:27,840
thousand i think it's kind of the great

3486
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,440
way to end it was the original way we

3487
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,599
ended the last hope with

3488
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:33,599
this strange eurovision song that

3489
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:36,239
johanna's introduced us to on our minds

3490
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:38,320
