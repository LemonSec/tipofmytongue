1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:28,589
[Music]

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,040
be

3
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
good morning every

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,719
afternoon i guess

5
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
good afternoon everybody and welcome to

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,240
a new hope

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,799
uh just a heads up the two o'clock

8
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
keynote speaker will be simulcast in

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
this room for anybody who's interested

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,680
so

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
protecting your communication is nothing

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
new but putting encrypted messages where

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
anyone can see them that's apparently

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
also not new

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,600
and our next presenters discovered the

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
secret messages and newspapers from over

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
a hundred years ago and decrypted them

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
so please welcome

19
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,210
our next speakers

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,159

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
slides here

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
so um i am ilanka doonan i'm a game

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
developer i'm an authority on different

30
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
codes and i'm a book author

31
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,479
and

32
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,318
and i'm aj jacobs i am also an author

33
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,520
and

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,239
i've given ted talks and

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,280
uh

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
and have worked as a journalist at

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
various publications

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
and he's being shy i should say that

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
he's worked for esquire magazine he's

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
given about five ted talks i think and

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
he's probably best known for a book he

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
wrote called the year of living

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
biblically

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
where he counted all the rules in the

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
bible about 700 rules and then tried to

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
see if he could really live by them for

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
an entire year uh he gave a really

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
interesting ted talk on it which i see

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
is both amusing and also

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
thought-provoking so

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,200
very nice

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
all right and of course klaus couldn't

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
be here um klaus and i wrote this book

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
code breaking a practical guide and this

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
came out in 2020 and we have a new

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
edition coming out that will be in early

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159
2023. it's about 20 more material on it

58
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,040
and aj's book my yeah my most recent

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
book is called the puzzler and it's

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
about my lifelong love of puzzles of all

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
kinds crosswords and jigsaws and logic

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
puzzles and it has a large section on

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,959
secret codes and ciphers

64
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
and

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,239
for for part of that i went to the cia

66
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
headquarters to visit the crypto

67
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
sculpture to see if i could figure it

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
out by being there in person i won't

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,360
ruin the ending to the book to by

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,599
telling you whether i got it or not but

71
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
i did um

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
i one of the main characters in that

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
section is of course alanka because she

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
is uh one of the if not the top expert

75
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
in the world on kryptos

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
and plus she also is a great character

77
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
she's uh you know she's someone who

78
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
takes five jigsaw puzzles and mixes up

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
all of the pieces and that and then

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
tries to solve them that's uh that's how

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
she spends her time

82
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
true okay

83
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
so um today we're going to be talking

84
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
about these different newspaper ads

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
mostly from the 19th century

86
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
and i'll start with a really interesting

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
one called the collinson expedition so

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
if you go back and you look through

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
microfilm as some of us do and you look

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
at the london times and this is between

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
1850 and 1855

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
you'll see that right there in the top

93
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
there is an ad that is encrypted and if

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
you keep looking through the microfilm

95
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
right around the first of the month

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
for five years appeared these encrypted

97
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
ads and um the times uh republished one

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
of these in 1980

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
asking could anyone

100
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
decrypt it and no one could however one

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
did point out what looked like a

102
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
latitude and longitude and so that gave

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,759
them a clue of what it might be it

104
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
pointed to this area north north of

105
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
canada and

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,280
they thought well maybe this has

107
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
something to do with the northwest

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
passage the british royal navy for a

109
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,440
long time was trying to find out if

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
there was

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
a faster way to asia instead of going

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
around the horn of south america could

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
they go through the northwest passage

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
north of canada and one of the famous

115
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
expeditions there was called the john

116
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,880
franklin expedition and it started in

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,199
1845 and he had two ships named the

118
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160
terror and the erebus uh now

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
interesting names for an exploration

120
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,560
ship well they had been warships they'd

121
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
been bombships that's why they were

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
called that but they were really

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
well-built ships and they thought that

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
this would be really well suited towards

125
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
icebreaking uh in the looking for the

126
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
northwest passage uh it was led by lord

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
franklin he wasn't the first choice for

128
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,039
it but he was the one that finally was

129
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,240
accepted he was 59 years old at the time

130
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
and

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
they left england and they headed west

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,199
they stopped off in greenland and then

133
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
continued west and they were seen by a

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
couple of whaling ships on their way

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
across baffin bay there and then

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
vanished

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
and there was no word from them

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
mrs franklin lady franklin was a quite

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
insistent that people go and look for

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
her husband in the expedition what had

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
happened to them and so there were

142
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
several rescue expeditions that were

143
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,720
sent out over a period of several years

144
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
led by admirals such as ross mcclure

145
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
collinson hall and schwatka those of you

146
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,680
who are star trek fans may notice the

147
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,479
third ship there was the hms enterprise

148
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,960
this was an earlier version of the name

149
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
there there was quite a reward for

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
anyone that could find any information

151
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
about what had happened to the franklin

152
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,280
expedition and there are many other

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
rescue expeditions and there are many

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
books that have been written about the

155
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,080
franklin expedition actually the ships

156
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
were recently found in 2014

157
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
one of the ships was found and in 2016

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
the other ship was found the

159
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
hms terror was actually found in the

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
aptly named terror bay complete

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
coincidence there um but now we come

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
back to that um encrypted message and

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
and what could it be related to what was

164
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
going on there was there a relationship

165
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,240
between the encrypted ad and

166
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
northwest passage or the franklin

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
expedition and it came out probably yes

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
so there's a cryptography journal called

169
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,680
called cryptologia and in 1992 john

170
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
rabson published the solution of these

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
messages and one of the plain texts in

172
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
this article and what he was finding as

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
he was analyzing the plain text he found

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
that there were many four letter groups

175
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
anyone here that's into cryptography you

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
go counting and looking for similarities

177
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,280
there so he found some four letter

178
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
groups and he found some three letter

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
groups and he noticed that in all of

180
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
these groups all of the letters were

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
from g to q

182
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
all right and then there were also some

183
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
capital letters that were always only

184
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,280
from b to f

185
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
and as analyzing it there are also

186
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
little bits of pieces of what we call

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
clear text so

188
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
thinking

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,560
maybe this was based on a code book of

190
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
some sort well what's the best way to

191
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
break a code book code well find the

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
code book

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
in this case this is not the code book

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
that was used but it is an example of a

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
code book and many ciphertexts are being

196
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
cracked even today

197
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
many ciphertexts are being cracked

198
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,799
because we find the uh

199
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
the encrypted text and then we also find

200
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
code books and so databases are being

201
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
built like just because it's a code book

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,959
which code book could it be so we're

203
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
using the computers to try and figure

204
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
out is it one of these code books and if

205
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
so is all of it done with the same code

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
book and on this code book that we're

207
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
looking at right now is from 1899 this

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,920
is the state department code book so the

209
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
question then is is there a code book

210
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
that uses those four letter groups based

211
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
on g to q

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,800
well no not that we know of but there is

213
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
one that uses four digit groups for

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
number groups and this is the the

215
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
marriott signal code and this was

216
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
introduced in 1817 by an english navy

217
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
officer frederick marriott this is a

218
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
reprint of one of the books and in that

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
book there are these flags and so if

220
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
you've wondered about the flags that

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
ships would

222
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,959
post as they're sailing past each other

223
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
and wanted to send a message and some of

224
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
these flags do represent different

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
numbers so was this code the one that

226
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
was used for the ads well we took a look

227
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,519
at it we said okay well we're going to

228
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,640
replace those letters g to q with digits

229
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
going 0 to 9 and then apply the code of

230
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,279
this book to it

231
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
but that didn't work so then we figure

232
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,080
okay well what else can we try and so

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,839
was it the wrong table was it the wrong

234
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
code book so then we start what we call

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
looking for cribs and trying to find

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
some some little piece of it that we can

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
dig into and we notice as we were

238
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
looking at these different ads there

239
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
would be these little bits and pieces of

240
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
of cleartext so right after this iqhl

241
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
was the word born so we're thinking

242
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
could they be talking about a baby that

243
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
was born a child a son or a daughter so

244
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
we started looking like okay could iqhl

245
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
mean the word sun and so you look for

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
where the word sun is in this book and

247
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,680
it comes out iqhl could be encrypted

248
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
with 8196 and so okay could it be a196

249
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
and then we go on like this and looking

250
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,279
for other cribs in this case mioq we're

251
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
thinking could it be the word month and

252
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
in that case yes and so then we fill in

253
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
more of the um

254
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
of the this table here and what we

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
finally get is that we can get the

256
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
entire thing but instead of going one to

257
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
nine going backwards nine to one and

258
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,839
that turned out to actually be the

259
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,360
system that was being used so you

260
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
replace the letters with the digits you

261
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
apply the code and you do get the plain

262
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
text the plain text i'm not going to

263
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
read all of it to you but it's it's

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
basically um chatty stuff you know your

265
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
wife and family are well and then

266
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
something here about captain penny

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
arrived at from baffins bay early in

268
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
september without success captain austin

269
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
hourly expected and then margaret's six

270
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,120
sunborne and so on so captain penny and

271
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
captain austin were also shipmasters who

272
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,519
were engaged in these franklin rescue

273
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,160
expeditions now why did they do this in

274
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
the times well they knew that no matter

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
where the ship would go

276
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
that the times was really available in

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,040
any city around the world and this would

278
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
be a way of communicating so who

279
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
published these particular ads well they

280
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
tended to be signed ac or jw and these

281
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
were identified we have a source that

282
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
says they're identified as relatives of

283
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
richard collinson who was the leader of

284
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
one of the rescue expeditions turned out

285
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
that was the one that used the hms

286
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,720
enterprise and the collinson expedition

287
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
was 1850 to 55 and the ads were

288
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
published 1850 to 1855. um so um now

289
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,880
they never found the franklin expedition

290
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
but they were going around from from a

291
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
different way so they were going from

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
england around the horn coming in and

293
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
trying to see if they could get to the

294
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
franklin expedition from the other side

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
they did not have any success and then

296
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
after that they went back to england so

297
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
it was a full around-the-world uh

298
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
journey um also i would point out that

299
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
they stopped in hawaii or what we call

300
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
hawaii today and at the time they called

301
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
it the sandwich islands

302
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,079
sandwich islands because that's what um

303
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,680
cook named it when he found those

304
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
islands um he and that's also where he

305
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
was killed when he really ticked off the

306
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,880
locals but that name of sandwich island

307
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
stuck for quite a bit

308
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
and about collins expedition there are a

309
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
few books that have been written about

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
that as well if anyone is interested

311
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
and in

312
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
if let me come back to this one on the

313
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
far left is blue book this came out in

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
1880 and this was done by collinson's

315
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,279
brother he went through all of the log

316
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,320
books from collinson's expedition and

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
edited them together and really what

318
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,880
comes out as a nice adventure story and

319
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
as part of it he does talk about the

320
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
cipher notices that were in the times

321
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
and um i won't go into great detail

322
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,680
other than to say it is described here

323
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
but even though this was described in

324
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
1880 when the times did their challenge

325
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
in 1980

326
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
people didn't know where to look they

327
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
didn't know that there had been a

328
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,440
description of this code at the time

329
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,399
so

330
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
as i said the times was really available

331
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,720
in every major port in the world and

332
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
we could potentially call this the first

333
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
known secure global communication system

334
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
in the 1800s now did it work well only

335
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
once and that was in in 1855 collinson

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
on his way out passing through the

337
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
islands northwest of australia there in

338
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
indonesia there was a straight where

339
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
many of the ships passed through this

340
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
was uh the islands of or the port of

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,680
bengo wenge or or banyu wangi and he was

342
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
able to get four copies of the paper

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
there four different month editions

344
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
there and so he was able to get some

345
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,000
news from home in that way so about the

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,079
collins and expedition the encryption

347
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,800
has been broken however not all 50 of

348
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
the ads have been formally decrypted yet

349
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
so if anyone wants to kind of take this

350
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
on as a puzzle

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
you can go you can find copies of the

352
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
newspaper on newpapernewspapers.com

353
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
and see if decrypted and let us know aha

354
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,920
we've solved this one we've solved this

355
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
one

356
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,199
all right and next ah thank you alanka

357
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,560
now we go from international exploration

358
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,920
to a romance uh in the 19th century

359
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
a lot of

360
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
lovers and perspective lovers

361
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
communicated through classified

362
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
newspaper ads

363
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,040
it was sort of the sexting of the 19th

364
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,440
century and

365
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
and some of them were in plain text some

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
were not encoded or in ciphered

367
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,079
uh one of my favorites was uh i think

368
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,160
you should go gotta go back one it is um

369
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
an ad that says i have the most

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,880
beautiful horse in england but not the

371
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
most beautiful lady your silence pains

372
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
me deeply so very romantic comparing her

373
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
to a horse uh

374
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
however uh

375
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
many of these uh ads were encoded and in

376
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
cypherd there is a book uh from 2006

377
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
uh that uh by gene palmer uh a pseudonym

378
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
for tony gaffney that has about a

379
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
thousand of them the agony column codes

380
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,759
and ciphers uh highly recommend it

381
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,000
and here's an example from 1853

382
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
of one

383
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,800
as you can see uh

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
it was uh it was in um

385
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
and ciphered and

386
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,880
it was broken uh using

387
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
the frequency analysis which as

388
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
many maybe most of you know you look at

389
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
which letters appear most frequently in

390
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
the cipher and compare that to which

391
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
letters appear most frequently in

392
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
english

393
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
and in this case it turned out to be a

394
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,440
caesar cipher one of the simplest

395
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
ciphers where you just shift the letter

396
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,160
so here we're shifting a

397
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,279
uh

398
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,720
five or six uh sections over

399
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
and when it was uh decrypted

400
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,440
it turned out to be a note

401
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
uh

402
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
from the uh from one lover to another

403
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,199
and

404
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
basically begging her to write back do

405
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
write a few lines darling please i have

406
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
been far from happy since you went away

407
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,560
this turns out to be quite a running

408
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
theme through many of these classified

409
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
ads please write i haven't heard from

410
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
you please please i miss you

411
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,959
in this one another little bit of

412
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
interest is that they are

413
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,559
uh

414
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,160
addressed to centauri

415
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,720
thank you for the italian

416
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,839
i needed that which

417
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,559
is cinderella in italian exactly

418
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,959
uh thank you all right here's another

419
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,319
interesting example this is from 1873

420
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
and this was an encrypted ad

421
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
now this one was decrypted using

422
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
something called tool

423
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
some of you may be familiar with that

424
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
this is a

425
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
software that looks at

426
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
the

427
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
letter patterns

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
of the words to see if they are

429
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
replicated

430
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,200
in

431
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
uh in actual english words so

432
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
it this one that's highlighted uh for

433
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
instance has a d in the seventh position

434
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
and a d in the fourteenth position

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,760
uh

436
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
are there so the software will look and

437
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
see what other english words have a say

438
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,200
the same letter in those two positions

439
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
and it was able to be uh

440
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
deciphered it was um

441
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
it was a simple substitution cipher and

442
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
it turns out uh

443
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
that it was from an unhappy wife uh we

444
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
don't know the whole story but uh this

445
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,080
man apparently a man uh left

446
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
and his disgrace that he left behind was

447
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
uh was quite ugly

448
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,039
uh

449
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,840
this uh another code

450
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,039
that

451
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,280
appeared in 1902

452
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
in the evening standard in england was

453
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,160
very interesting because this one was

454
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
not cracked for many many years

455
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
people applied the frequency analysis to

456
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
it but it didn't map onto english it was

457
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
all over the place

458
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,840
finally in 2014 a german philologist

459
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,679
named thomas ernst

460
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,840
was able to make a breakthrough he

461
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,360
realized that if you split it up into

462
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
two parts

463
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
alternating parts

464
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,400
the red and the blue parts

465
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
then it becomes

466
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
and then do a frequency analysis it

467
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,520
actually will line up and then he has

468
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
sort of loosened the jar on the

469
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,760
mayonnaise and a man named jaral van

470
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
icah

471
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,559
a computer specialist from belgium he

472
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
used that and actually

473
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,280
cracked it and as you can see

474
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,840
if you put them together

475
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,679
it spells out

476
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,160
actual english i was aghast at her pain

477
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,720
but oh my dearest i cannot bear it

478
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
i always said it would kill me to have

479
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,320
no sign of you again with the please

480
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
write i don't hear from you it's killing

481
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
me

482
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
um

483
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,559
and i won't read the rest of the cipher

484
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,360
but that is uh those are three examples

485
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,640
of uh

486
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
of romantic ciphers but there are many

487
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,679
out there that are still to be solved so

488
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
i encourage people to look into it uh

489
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,480
because it's a fun puzzle and of course

490
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,360
we want them all cracked yeah yeah y'all

491
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
he actually

492
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,600
just saw this in may uh so just um just

493
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
a couple months ago this year he was

494
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
also one of the guys that was involved

495
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
with cracking the zodiac cipher so if

496
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
you were following that he was one of

497
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
the trio there

498
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
so next we'll go to something called the

499
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,520
gunwa cryptogram and this is in denver

500
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120
and this is interesting partially

501
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
because it's the only example we have of

502
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
an american

503
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
cipher of an encrypted classified ad in

504
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
an american paper

505
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
if there's any others we don't know

506
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
about them so please do tell us other

507
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,159
than that it was really kind of a

508
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,960
european thing so we have this uh

509
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
encryption uh and it's all encrypted

510
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,799
except for the bottom line which is

511
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,919
gunwa

512
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,880
1629 larimer street this is an address

513
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
in denver and there really was a company

514
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,679
called the goonwa company in the 19th

515
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,520
century there

516
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,240
and this gunwa was a fake chinese doctor

517
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
so this gunwal was a company that was

518
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,640
created by a handful of businessmen who

519
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,159
were selling

520
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,559
somewhat doubtful remedies and there

521
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,480
were several branches across the united

522
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
states and one of the branches was in

523
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
denver

524
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,880
which existed from 1888 to 1894. here's

525
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
a one of their ads this was in an

526
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,440
indianapolis newspaper here's another

527
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
one of their ads this was in a

528
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,600
pittsburgh newspaper and um coming back

529
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
to the denver one it was founded by an

530
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
irish immigrant william hale

531
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
now later he was indicted on mail fraud

532
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,320
charges and mailing pornographic

533
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,799
materials but were continually curious

534
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,000
what would qualify as pornography in the

535
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
mid-1800s showing their ankles or

536
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,919
what is it but in any case he fled to

537
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,559
england to escape prosecution and then

538
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,080
he came back to the united states and

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
was arrested um so here's kind of the

540
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
the timeline on it he founded the denver

541
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,600
branch in 1888 then this ad was

542
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,320
published in 1889 but then he wasn't

543
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
arrested until 1891 then in 94 he

544
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
escaped to europe returned came back

545
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
arrested so

546
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
what is this ad this one single

547
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,840
encrypted ad we don't know why this one

548
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
ad was encrypted it's 77 letters we've

549
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,880
done frequency analysis on it and the

550
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
index of coincidence is kind of odd it's

551
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,799
uh 4.1

552
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,960
um as opposed to english which has an

553
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
ioc of 6.7

554
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,919
so it's probably not a transposition or

555
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
a monoalphabetic substitution now we've

556
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
klaus has a blog where he has some very

557
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,280
solid code breakers and they've kind of

558
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
talked about it and saying well maybe

559
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,679
it's a a polyalphabetic cipher with a

560
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,159
period of five but still no one has

561
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,440
cracked it so

562
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,200
what could it be it doesn't mean that

563
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
it's communication with with one of the

564
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
other branches was he communicating with

565
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,679
other business partners or was it

566
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
communicating with a smuggler or a

567
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,480
blackmailer we don't know and this thing

568
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,919
still stays

569
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
unsolved

570
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
so next i'm going to go into enola

571
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,280
holmes who is not really 1800s but we're

572
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,919
fitting her in here because the time

573
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,880
period and ola holmes is a fictional

574
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
sister of sherlock holmes she is

575
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
non-canon there is no mention of enola

576
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
homes in any of the original sherlock

577
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
holm stories but there is um

578
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,440
some

579
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,960
teen fiction these days and anola holmes

580
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
is a very popular character and there

581
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,440
was a movie that came out in 2020 and

582
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,279
they're really putting some budget on it

583
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,360
you can see there's millie bobby brown

584
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
that some of you may recognize from

585
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,440
stranger things she was 11 or l uh henry

586
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
cavill you know he's superman

587
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
the witcher tudors and then also you see

588
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,960
helena bonham carter harry potter king's

589
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
speech princess margaret and the crown

590
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
so they're getting some some big names

591
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,159
into this uh enola homes movie and all

592
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
the homes 2 is about to drop on netflix

593
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
i've been checking netflix every day and

594
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,559
it's kind of like they said it's going

595
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
to be in fall but it's not quite here

596
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
yet so um but in the first version there

597
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,840
are many codes and ciphers this is one

598
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,960
that shows up very briefly on the screen

599
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
has no relationship to the plot that we

600
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
know of we have not been able to crack

601
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
this one it looks like it's a playfair

602
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
message it looks like playfair but um we

603
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,480
haven't been able to solve it maybe it's

604
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
an easter egg for later

605
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
and there are many other messages

606
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
and you'll be able to see these

607
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
pictures from our slides we're streaming

608
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,279
the talk right now and uh later the

609
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
entire recording of this talk is going

610
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,679
to be available on the web uh i think at

611
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
the end of the convention so um on the

612
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
right here we have something from the

613
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
as i said in the plot palmell gazette

614
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
and a code there that one is crackable

615
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
i'll talk more about that in a second

616
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
and also in the movie which is why we're

617
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,279
including in this talk we have this

618
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
encrypted classified ad with these

619
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,240
numbers in it and it's curious to us

620
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
because we're also thinking about where

621
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
did they get the idea for this and and

622
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
we're a little suspicious about one

623
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
thing here um because there was this

624
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,919
movie ad and also a graphic novel that

625
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,640
uses these numbers and also um in

626
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,200
1833 there was a real classified ad that

627
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
used a similar code system so like did

628
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,720
they get the idea for it from there um

629
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
going on the ad that is in the movie um

630
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
they decrypt it and she's decrypting it

631
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,799
with this code wheel which is completely

632
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
ridiculous you wouldn't use a code wheel

633
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
to solve that kind of code but anyway um

634
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
and and then she decrypts it and she

635
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,919
writes it out and she writes it out

636
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,559
wrong which makes us crazy but um

637
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,120
you know it is solvable and

638
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,039
if you go the correct decryption of the

639
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,240
ad is

640
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
using this kind of square on the left

641
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
hand side there which is kind of a

642
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
polybius square iv meet me royal academy

643
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
five tonight mother and um also there's

644
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
a similar system that's used in the

645
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
graphic novel also has this kind of

646
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
square system where you can take each

647
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
each two numbers as a pair rows and

648
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,360
columns and figure it out that way again

649
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
you don't do it with a code wheel

650
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,159
anyway

651
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
and this is what's in the graphic novel

652
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
and then the real ad also uses this

653
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,159
modified system and um this is what the

654
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,360
real ad said from 1833 which is again as

655
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,760
aj said very similar you know i've been

656
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,240
ill love very ill my doctors ordered a

657
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
change of scenes and air and so forth i

658
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
haven't heard from you since you left

659
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,080
aji um and and so again these kind of

660
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,919
agony that's what was called these agony

661
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,279
columns so the timeline for enola homes

662
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,559
again we had these numbers in the

663
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,279
graphic novel then klaus

664
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
who's not here but who he had blogged

665
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
about this other ad the real ad in 1833

666
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
he blogged about it in january 2019 and

667
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,640
then movie production started around

668
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
july 2019

669
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,799
which is why we're kind of thinking that

670
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
you know maybe they read klaus's blog we

671
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
don't know for sure but just could be

672
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
okay so the sequel has been announced

673
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,640
for coming out later this year and i am

674
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,320
eagerly awaiting to see what kind of

675
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,960
codes they use in it

676
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
thank you ilanka

677
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
next we go to the ruby series which is

678
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,320
an example of what i was talking about

679
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,640
before the romance

680
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
ads uh but it's a particularly

681
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
interesting one so we wanted to quickly

682
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,919
highlight it it was uh in gaffney's book

683
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,480
and also the readers of klaus's blog

684
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
helped to decrypt it

685
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
it's a great blog by the way

686
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,880
and we're sad that he couldn't be here

687
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,679
but

688
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,960
but definitely check out klaus's blog

689
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
it was a series of 25 ads in the daily

690
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,559
telegraph over a period of three or four

691
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,520
years

692
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
and

693
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
they have been decrypted as you can see

694
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
they they were simple substitution

695
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
ciphers uh

696
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
and

697
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,440
uh

698
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
when they are decrypted

699
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,440
uh they read

700
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,039
uh it is uh

701
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
they are dressed to ruby

702
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,240
uh but the writer is once again talking

703
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
about

704
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
uh her lack of uh communication so uh

705
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,240
she's as they say now ghosting him and

706
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,039
he is not happy uh

707
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
and uh just skipping over to uh

708
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,919
advertisement eight

709
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,480
uh he gets more and more frustrated and

710
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
finally he starts lashing out i think it

711
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
is mean of you

712
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,919
not to write oftener

713
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
and then in

714
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,640
the last five ads uh

715
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,960
i i found this particularly interesting

716
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,240
because he says

717
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
on august uh

718
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,480
on august 15th um he says

719
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,000
uh he says i am going to write you no

720
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,640
more until i hear from you so he lays

721
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
down the line he is putting an ultimatum

722
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,480
out there five seven days later he's

723
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
like

724
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,399
anything please just write i mean come

725
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,279
on

726
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,360
so he didn't have the best impulse

727
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,480
control

728
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
uh now what we particularly like about

729
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,360
these ads is that alanka and klaus did

730
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
additional sleuthing and was and were

731
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,080
able to find out more about the writer

732
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,679
because in one of these ads he says his

733
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,240
address his physical address and he says

734
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,440
please write me at uh number three

735
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,039
falcon terrace falcon clampim junction

736
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,840
and uh klaus and alanka were able to use

737
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,720
google maps and google view to actually

738
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,799
find where he lived uh which is now it's

739
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,520
on this block and right now it's a

740
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,080
motorcycle repair shop

741
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,399
and he lived uh nearby he lived just a

742
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,559
stone's throw from that it's

743
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,039
the actual apartment has been torn down

744
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
we believe alanka found an a map from

745
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,679
1893 that shows exactly where the

746
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
apartment would have been

747
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,520
and then we did some even more sleuthing

748
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,679
because we want to find out the identity

749
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
of this person and there was an

750
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,919
interesting hint in an 1884 ad

751
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,200
where he said he apologizes that he has

752
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,279
not written i'm sure she doesn't care

753
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,799
judging by the amount of uh responses he

754
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,600
gets but he apologizes and says he was

755
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
up in the himalayas

756
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
uh and this we think is not a metaphor

757
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,279
because this era was when the british

758
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,120
were exploring and mapping the himalayas

759
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,480
so we know his physical address we know

760
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
that he was a himalayan explorer

761
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,559
and so we just need some help actually

762
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,200
tracking down the name which we think is

763
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
probably somewhere in the housing

764
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,799
records in england so we throw that out

765
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,519
as a possible puzzle to someone out

766
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
there

767
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,399
next we're going to go to french ads so

768
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
again as i said there was only one in

769
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
the united states that we know of we

770
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,320
actually found several in france and

771
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,960
this was a because we had again klaus

772
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
one of his blog readers

773
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,519
learned of this and he was one of his

774
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,799
readers was french and had found many

775
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,519
ads in print in france and what we

776
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,360
learned about was this man named etienne

777
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
bazarri who

778
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,559
became a military cryptologist starting

779
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,200
with his interest in cracking the codes

780
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
of the agony columns in the newspaper so

781
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,360
this was common in england as well

782
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,960
people would put these encrypted ads in

783
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,679
the paper and others on sunday would go

784
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
aha sunday time and they would pick up a

785
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,159
copy of the paper and go to a coffee

786
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,640
shop and just start cracking the codes

787
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,399
of the classified ads just so they could

788
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
kind of snoop in and see what people

789
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,080
were saying because it was just simple

790
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,159
substitution ciphers and so this is what

791
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,480
atien was doing in the french ciphers

792
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
and but later he become probably the

793
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,360
leading french cryptologist of his time

794
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
um and so this was um as i said dda

795
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,399
mueller was one of the klaus's blog

796
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,279
readers he found hundreds of ads in

797
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,919
french and he has a full database of

798
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
them up on his website he's done a

799
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,679
wonderful job here most of them it's

800
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,279
exactly the same as the english they use

801
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,240
simple substitution this is an example

802
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
shifa and and claire and then um i'll

803
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,439
read it

804
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,480
so because i can't see you i can't go to

805
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
see you please let me tell you that i

806
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,159
love you this way and that way no one

807
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,679
will see me blush

808
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,960
and so again very romantic things now

809
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
some some of some of them we have not

810
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,640
solved yet and

811
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
this is just very briefly i'm going to

812
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
go over these if anyone wants to take a

813
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,760
shot at them later

814
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
some of them have very interesting

815
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
systems this one it sort of looks

816
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,158
musical

817
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,719
nice

818
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
etc etc

819
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
meaning that which can neither be said

820
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,840
nor written can be sung and then oh remy

821
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,159
and then have you understood this so a

822
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
lot of discussion about what this is i i

823
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,039
do have a couple fans who are classical

824
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,159
music uh classical music fans themselves

825
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,799
and they say it sounds like a choir's

826
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,320
practice as they're going through the

827
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,880
different notes so maybe this meant

828
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
something in secret to them there's also

829
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,159
this language called solrisol

830
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,760
which was an artificial language

831
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,480
designed by a frenchman based on musical

832
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,559
notes so i was thinking well if it's

833
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
alrisal who can i find who knows

834
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,440
solrisol so i go on discord and i look

835
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
for a community of people who know

836
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
solvers all and i found one um and you

837
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
can find everything on discord and um i

838
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,879
found a community and i said hey can you

839
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,800
you guys know saurusal can you tell me

840
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
what this says but they it didn't mean

841
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
anything to them they got some basic

842
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,399
words on it i said well if we can

843
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,079
commute if we can decrypt it it's

844
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,040
probably i miss you why haven't you sent

845
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,520
me a letter that kind of standard thing

846
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,440
and um but still they couldn't solve it

847
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,679
so so we don't know exactly what this it

848
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,599
could mean meet you at choir practice we

849
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,679
don't know so unsolved and then we have

850
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
um ignatius pollacki yes thank you

851
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,199
alanka and and also thank you for your

852
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,000
excellent french accent very impressive

853
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,359
yeah and ignatius palaki is one of the

854
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,599
best characters in code breaking history

855
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
in my opinion uh right up there with

856
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
ilanka he was uh a one of the first

857
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,280
private detectives uh he's been called

858
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,839
the real sherlock holmes there is a

859
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,599
debate over whether he actually

860
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
influenced arthur conan doyle

861
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,359
but it's quite likely he did

862
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,119
and he

863
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,000
he was also satirized as a character in

864
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,440
a gilbert and sullivan play so or

865
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
what do they call them operettas uh

866
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
so he's uh he was quite famous in his

867
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,480
day and he often made use of newspaper

868
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,240
advertisements to communicate with his

869
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
clients

870
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,119
uh and he would uh he would sometimes

871
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,599
write where that they should meet on elm

872
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
and second avenue

873
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
now this one i think is a classic in

874
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,880
1869

875
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,320
he wrote to one of his clients

876
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,560
although possessing a thorough knowledge

877
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
of eight languages i cannot detect sense

878
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
from your epistle so completely

879
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,119
condescending that to me reminds me of

880
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,560
something that sherlock holmes would

881
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,799
write

882
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,320
uh he also put in ads for missing people

883
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
um sort of like the uh the milk cartons

884
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
from my childhood

885
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,960
uh but in addition to that uh the plain

886
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,200
text messages he would also send

887
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,280
encrypted messages to his clients

888
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,760
now these encrypted messages as you can

889
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,560
see

890
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,680
they were often numerical uh

891
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,160
which leads us to think they might be a

892
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
code book there might be a code book but

893
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,280
that code book has yet to be found so

894
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,240
these

895
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,359
remain unsolved we've cracked some of

896
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,040
pilaki's but not all so

897
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,359
again we encourage people to try this

898
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,720
one is one of my favorites

899
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,599
because it's so unusual it it looks a

900
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,839
little like a pig pen cipher

901
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,079
maybe mixed with braille

902
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,480
but again unsolved

903
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,440
and uh we would love to have help

904
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
figuring these out

905
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,920
thank you

906
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,200
so there are lots more um we could give

907
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,040
examples and go on for another hour with

908
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,760
the various ones but i'll simply say

909
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,440
that there are many more most were

910
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,359
published in the late 19th century i

911
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
think things sort of trailed off there

912
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,480
because it was uh not as necessary to be

913
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,200
secret like dating became an option you

914
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
didn't have to hide your your feelings

915
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
for someone all the time

916
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
most of these encrypted messages are

917
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,040
broken but some are not and um also

918
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,400
looking for the code books is also a a

919
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
very fun activity people are like well

920
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
okay we have these encrypted messages

921
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
that need a code book oh look i found a

922
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
new code book and then they're

923
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
immediately trying to see if that may

924
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
help us to crack all the previously

925
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,359
encrypted messages and other than that

926
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,598
thank you

927
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:53,680
[Applause]

928
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,520
i think we have time for a couple

929
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
questions

930
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
if you have any questions please line up

931
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
i have a question from the matrix church

932
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,280
matrix

933
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
how realistic are the crypto story lines

934
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,800
in neil stephenson's cryptonomicon

935
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
how realistic are what

936
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
in the book cryptonomic on by neil

937
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
stevenson there were various ciphers

938
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,760
that were used that's a big question

939
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
um i'd have to i think i can answer that

940
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,800
one in more detail um

941
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,240
i'm of course aware of the the book

942
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
cryptonomicon by neil stevenson but uh

943
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
yeah that's a big question that i think

944
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,200
well i i will just say that uh

945
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,160
alanka has been featured as a character

946
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,040
in dan brown's novel uh

947
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,400
it was uh which novel angels and uh lost

948
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
lost symbol sequel to da vinci symbols

949
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
and it was a character who is an anagram

950
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
a scrambled version of your name nola k

951
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,920
right so

952
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,079
and i actually had i don't know if you

953
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,079
can't see it here but i had special

954
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,359
shoes made from vans that have nola k

955
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,119
embroidered on them nola on the left

956
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,800
foot k on the right foot so if anyone

957
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,119
wants to take pictures of my shoes later

958
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,880
that's fine and were you

959
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,480
were you a uh

960
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,119
a consultant for dan he's just a fan of

961
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,440
your work no no he talked to me and he'd

962
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
ask me questions

963
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
and i'd give him advice on this and that

964
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
and often he'd ask me a question i'd

965
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
tell him and then he'd ignore it and go

966
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,880
on and do whatever he was going to do

967
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
yeah

968
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,520
okay

969
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
sir just following on the thread of

970
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,160
where one person had two ciphers in one

971
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,400
ad are there any examples of people

972
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
distributing messages across multiple

973
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,240
classified ads

974
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,839
so you know half the information is in

975
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,920
one ad and another half is in another ad

976
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,599
either the same day or another day is

977
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,760
there any kind of evidence of that kind

978
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,400
of activity

979
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,119
i'm having a lot of trouble hearing um

980
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,240
yeah doesn't catch it yeah so i'm i'm

981
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
asking um

982
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
following on for the thread where there

983
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,800
was each four-letter group was a

984
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,320
different different cipher has it been

985
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
any examples where people have used

986
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,240
spread mess ciphers over multiple

987
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,560
messages either in the same day or the

988
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,680
next day

989
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,839
to make it harder to find cribs and so

990
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,960
on uh

991
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,760
well we certainly had a series of ads

992
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,000
but i'm not sure exactly whether they

993
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,800
were

994
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,040
spread over what do you think alanka did

995
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,119
you run across any of that well tell me

996
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,760
again what yes it's basically where they

997
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
split up into several ads so that

998
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,160
you needed the first ad to decipher the

999
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
section yeah we actually do have an

1000
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
example we didn't have a slide for it

1001
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,280
but someone said um this this message

1002
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,079
will become clear if you look at my

1003
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,000
message from um the 18th inst and inst

1004
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,200
was something commonly used called

1005
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,920
instante uh mensa which meant in this

1006
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
month it was a common thing so we we

1007
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,520
looked at the other ad there was another

1008
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,079
encrypted ad on that day but

1009
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
we still couldn't understand what the

1010
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,359
two of them meant but i can definitely

1011
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,560
get you that if you're interested in

1012
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,920
bringing it thank you so much awesome

1013
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,079
okay

1014
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,880
hey so just an

1015
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
off quite not really off question but

1016
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,160
not off track you mentioned that you

1017
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,760
kind of got into this because of your

1018
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,599
love for puzzles but what made you think

1019
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,520
to look in an 1890s newspaper

1020
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,200
got into this because of love for

1021
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,359
puzzles but and then what made you look

1022
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,520
and 1890s a newspaper

1023
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:25,880
um

1024
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,119
[Music]

1025
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,160
wow

1026
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
well people write to us all the time

1027
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
with with different codes and puzzles

1028
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,839
and especially they say i i went through

1029
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,240
our attic the other day and we found

1030
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,040
this postcard to my great great great

1031
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,520
grandfather and it seems to be in code

1032
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,119
we'd love to know what it says can you

1033
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,599
help us and and sometimes we can we say

1034
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,800
oh it's a substitution cipher and

1035
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,599
sometimes we have no clue um but through

1036
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
that we often are doing research for it

1037
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,040
and saying hmm this reminds me of

1038
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
something i saw here and you just kind

1039
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,359
of spider web out and find something

1040
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,000
that leads you to something yeah yeah

1041
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,839
and also uh

1042
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,720
i ran for my book i ran across several

1043
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,640
other examples of of codes and ciphers

1044
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,760
uh

1045
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
crossing over with newspapers and some

1046
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
of you might know that

1047
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,800
the the famous crossword puzzle that

1048
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,040
appeared in the telegraph at the start

1049
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
of world war ii

1050
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
and uh it was

1051
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
it said that if you're able to solve

1052
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,160
this in 12 minutes or less please get in

1053
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,319
contact with this

1054
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,680
with this number and it turned out to be

1055
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,599
the um

1056
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,240
the enigma cipher the bletchley park

1057
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,280
folks so i always argue crossword

1058
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
puzzles helped save the world

1059
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,560
there was also a very bizarre

1060
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,200
scandal like a national security scandal

1061
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,920
in towards the end of world war ii

1062
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,270
where

1063
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,680
[Music]

1064
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
several puzzles in a row i believe it

1065
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,839
was in the telegraph again

1066
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,000
contained words

1067
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,560
related top secret words related to

1068
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,000
d-day and this was right before d-day so

1069
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,640
it was words like utah and overlord

1070
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,400
which was the um

1071
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
which was the code name for the whole uh

1072
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,760
for the whole uh enterprise

1073
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,520
and the

1074
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
british secret service understandably

1075
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,839
got very nervous they did not like this

1076
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,720
at all

1077
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,520
and they um arrested

1078
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,560
the crossword puzzle maker who was this

1079
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,359
uh

1080
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,960
shy headmaster of a british school of

1081
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,280
you know a public school

1082
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,640
and they they interrogated him and they

1083
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
decided in the end it was just a very

1084
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,760
weird coincidence there have been

1085
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,680
further conspiracy theories that it was

1086
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
more than a coincidence because the

1087
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
school was apparently located near

1088
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,760
um some sort of military base and they

1089
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
and the crossword puzzles were

1090
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,920
co-written with the students so this

1091
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,680
theory says the students were

1092
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,079
eavesdropping on the soldiers heard the

1093
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,520
words and being sneaky and mischievous

1094
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,079
put them into the crossword puzzle so

1095
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
that remains a mystery but i just love

1096
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,359
that

1097
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,200
overlap between

1098
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,880
puzzles and

1099
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,800
and codes and national security

1100
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,200
there's an interesting question here

1101
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,599
from band-aid in the matrix chat

1102
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,560
how much would one of these ads cost in

1103
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,040
modern currency

1104
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,200
that's a great question i

1105
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,359
sorry i've that's something i should

1106
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,440
research how much does an ad cost today

1107
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,480
i mean

1108
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,319
in the papers that still do them i don't

1109
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,640
get i think zero because it's craigslist

1110
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,799
yeah

1111
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,040
and another question from the matrix

1112
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,960
chat from cell split

1113
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,560
what is the oldest known encrypted

1114
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
message and also those messages that

1115
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,880
haven't been decrypted

1116
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,560
are they unique encryptions made by the

1117
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,000
writers of the messages or are they just

1118
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,119
examples of really good encryption

1119
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,359
wait i almost heard it it was are they

1120
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,560
it's tough when someone's talking

1121
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,839
through a mask into a microphone

1122
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,680
so the question is

1123
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,079
if the

1124
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,760
undeciphered messages if they were

1125
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,359
simply

1126
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,160
one-offs by the original writers or are

1127
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,079
they just examples of excellent

1128
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,400
encryption

1129
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
if it's a single message it's hard to

1130
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,960
tell but we can do some analysis of it

1131
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
to see okay it's one message we can't

1132
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,680
like the the good noise message we don't

1133
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,760
know if it's really good encryption

1134
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,640
maybe

1135
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,560
the message was someone i'm gonna post

1136
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
an ad that means nothing but when you

1137
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,960
see that this means you should you know

1138
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,160
set to port on the third or something i

1139
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
couldn't tell you yeah i think

1140
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,800
um you know obviously the shorter the

1141
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,839
message the more difficult it is to

1142
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,200
decipher which is why partly why

1143
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,599
part four of the crypto sculpture is

1144
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,240
only 97 characters so that's partly why

1145
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,880
it has stumped us for so long yeah if we

1146
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,599
had a lot of text from k4 it would have

1147
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,200
been we'd probably have it solved i

1148
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,599
think

1149
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,319
one more question from the online check

1150
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,160
from aesthetics

1151
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,800
you have mentioned many kinds of ciphers

1152
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,960
how could a beginner know or learn more

1153
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,400
about them

1154
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,520
learn more about ciphers i recommend

1155
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,960
the book by alanka and klaus or my book

1156
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,839
of course uh but yeah this is a great

1157
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
this is a great guide it's partly why i

1158
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
interviewed alanka for my book

1159
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,359
there's also a really good book

1160
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,480
by simon singh

1161
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,079
s-i-n-g-h-g-h called the code book and

1162
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,599
if you want to learn more about the

1163
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,079
people that made codes you want to look

1164
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,720
for a book by david khan k-a-h-n the

1165
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,880
code breakers which is really considered

1166
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,480
the gold standard in the community

1167
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,040
i have a question have you found any

1168
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,800
evidence of how the solutions were

1169
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,079
shared with the recipients

1170
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,480
like so you know the codes are that the

1171
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,200
ciphers are in the ads but then how did

1172
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,560
the person is receiving it know how to

1173
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,200
decipher it

1174
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,880
i can't

1175
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
understand it

1176
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,880
yeah i'm sorry it was how how do we know

1177
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,800
that the people understood

1178
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,480
was that right like how did the

1179
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,319
recipients of the message

1180
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,400
get the the solutions to it to them

1181
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,599
if someone has an answer bring them with

1182
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,200
my

1183
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,119
yes pre-arrangement i would agree with

1184
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,440
that yeah you agree on here's the code

1185
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,520
book we're going to use or here

1186
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,400
and

1187
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,640

any other questions

1190
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,160

1191
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,079
all right well thank you all
