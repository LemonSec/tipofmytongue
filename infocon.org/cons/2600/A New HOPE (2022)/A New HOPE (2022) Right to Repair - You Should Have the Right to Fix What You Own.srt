22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
in his store in manhattan

23
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
three thousand videos

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
and one point seven million subscribers

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
later he now crisscrosses the country

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,640
speaking to legislation legislation

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
legislatures every nationwide about the

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,920
right to repair

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
ladies and gentlemen louis rossman

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
thank you

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
thank you

32
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,680
thank you very much

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
okay i have a confession to make here so

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
i am not a public speaker i don't know

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
how to fill an hour and i didn't write a

36
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
speech so think of this like having a

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
substitute teacher except without that

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,920
kick a dope mean you get when you

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
realize that your final is not delayed

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
until next week that you didn't study

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
for but we're still gonna have some fun

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,399
so

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
has anybody here had to go to a hospital

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
and lie down on either an operating

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
table or one of those beds that they

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
have

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
most of the audience is less careless

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
than i am guessing by the low show of

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
hands so there is a now in this bed

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
there's a motor and it's similar to the

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
motor that you have in a car seat where

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
you can adjust it the doctor can have

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
you go back forth forward back like up

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,959
down

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
sometimes this breaks and it stops

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
working this table is about 35 000

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
what would you estimate it costs to fix

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
that when that motor dies you just toss

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,399
out any number

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,720
you're not supposed to get it right in

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
the first try

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
it takes away my fun so yes i did an

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
interview on my channel it's somebody

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
that fixes medical equipment for a

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
living and it's 35 000 their answer is

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
you buy a new table they can't buy that

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
motor because the company has the motor

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
the motor manufacturer change slightly

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
so the motor that's on the market won't

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
fit there and they tell the manufacturer

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
of the motor don't sell this motor so

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
they are forced to spend 35 000 to

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
replace the table in spite of the fact

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
that it has one small thing wrong with

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
it that you don't even need to be a

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
medical professional to fix and there's

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
a lot of arguments in this country about

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
whether or not we should have

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
single-payer healthcare insurance

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,080
provided healthcare or if it should just

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,599
you know get rid of the mess that makes

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,800
it so expensive to where you can't

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,159
afford basic

84
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,599
work off your own paycheck but at the

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
end of the day somebody's paying that 35

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
thousand dollars for a broken motor or

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
another example like i saw a few people

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,280
with macbooks here let's say you have a

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
two thousand dollar macbook you notice

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,319
the battery's five percent you go to

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
plug it in you plug it in it goes

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,920
and it stops working what would it cost

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
to get that two thousand dollar macbook

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
fixed

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
guesses yeah shout out any price

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,519
okay 500 what else we have

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
1 000 okay we're getting closer

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
somebody's been to the genius bar what

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
else

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
it's usually 12 it's usually 12 to

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
fifteen hundred dollars and there's a

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
chip that goes bad inside of it it's

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
made by intercell it's called an isl9240

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
and when this chip goes bad it stops

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
charging now this should be a fairly

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
simple repair the problem with it is

107
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,519
that they tell the company making the

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,120
chip don't sell it to anybody else you

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
can't go to mouse or a digi key or

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
newark or buy it what we'll do is we

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
will go to let's say we'll have to find

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
another device that uses this exact same

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
chip so we'll have to randomly rip open

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
a bunch of stuff that we buy and spend

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,080
money on and figure out that there's an

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
iphone 10r charging case with the

117
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
extended battery that uses this same

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
chip and then we'll take that apart we

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
will throw the battery away into an

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
e-waste container we'll take the chip

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
off of it re-ball it and put it on a

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,440
board so that we can make that work

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
again

124
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,360
let's say now this is something that

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
pretty much spans all industries so if

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
we're talking about let's say tractors

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
let's say you're actually able to find

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
everything you need to fix your 500 000

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
combine will it work again after you fix

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
it yes or no

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
no because you have to have somebody

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
from the dealer come out at 125 an hour

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
that sometimes there's a two to three

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
week wait in the middle of your harvest

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
to plug his computer and to say to clear

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
the error code and say it's okay you're

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,120
allowed to use what you spent half a

138
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,039
million dollars on i'm going to stop

139
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
this uh knock-off game of the price is

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
right because it's kind of getting old

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
to get to the point that this is

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
something that spans virtually every

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
single industry whether we're talking

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
about medical equipment home appliances

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
laptops cell phones automobiles and it's

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
something that i walked into by accident

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
so this is not something that i was

148
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
intending to do i used to work at a

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
recording studio the recording studio

150
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
closed i needed a macbook to work on a

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
session that i was working on in logic

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,919
and as some people are watching my

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,199
youtube channel may gather i'm not the

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,479
biggest fan of apple products so i

155
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,479
didn't own one so i had to buy a macbook

156
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,960
i bought it it showed up broken i i got

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,039
a partial refund from the seller i found

158
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
the part to make it work again i made

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
about 250 and i thought huh

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,199
i have made making four to 600 a month

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
for the past year i just made 250 bucks

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
for 20 minutes of my time let's try that

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,280
again and the we and i built a business

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
off of it and the weird thing is that it

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
took me five years to finally ask the

166
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
question why is this so hard if i want a

167
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
manual why do i have to wait for

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
somebody to leak it on some romanian ftp

169
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,080
server that i have to worry about

170
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
getting shut down why do i have to wire

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
money to strange people that have that

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,000
don't have real businesses in order to

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
buy a part rather than just reach out to

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,919
lg or intersil or any of these companies

175
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,440
and just buy from them or their

176
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
distributors and it's something that is

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
um

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
it's something that took about five

179
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
years for me to finally start asking and

180
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
the thing is i'm not that young

181
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,360
but i'm young enough that i'm not old

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
enough to remember when all these

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
devices came with manuals when you could

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
actually buy a computer that had uh that

185
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
had all of the documentation all the

186
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
schematics when you could go to radio

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
shack and buy tubes for your television

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
or your amplifier or anything else and

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
the idea back then that people would

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
make the argument that it is unsafe to

191
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
do this type of work that there's a

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
security issue a safety issue you

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
shouldn't be allowed to do this would be

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
absolutely seen as insane and ridiculous

195
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
but it's something that's seen as fairly

196
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
commonplace today

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
when it comes to arguments made against

198
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
repair one of my favorite arguments this

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
goes back to 2015 was speaking to an

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
assembly person in new york state who

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
said that he was told by a manufacturer

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
when i replace a fuse or a one a wire on

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
a motherboard of a macbook i've now

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
converted that macbook into a pc but i'm

205
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
still representing it as a macbook to my

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,039
customer which is fraud which is why i

207
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,560
shouldn't be allowed to do what i do

208
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
does this argument hold any faith with

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
anybody in the audience

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
so i see we have no politicians here but

211
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,840
the thing is i'm not a professional

212
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,039
activist i'm not a professional

213
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,520
politician legislator or anything like

214
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
that the re the way that i got into this

215
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
is i my face turned red when this guy

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
told me this and there was i just felt

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
incredibly aggravated and i asked him

218
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
why did you believe this and he

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
says well nobody came here to tell me

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
otherwise that now you did so thank you

221
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
and he and he co-sponsors the bill and

222
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
he actually signs it he changed his mind

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,599
so i thought okay everybody has this

224
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
idea that the reason that the bad people

225
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
win is because of all this money and all

226
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,160
this power and all this corruption all

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
of that and the other and the reality

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,720
like the real red pull of it is that

229
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
nobody actually showed up he said

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
you know this has been something on the

231
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
docket for about two or three years and

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
you're the first person to show up that

233
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,319
was actually in favor of it that

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
actually explained this to me so

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,360
that was really all it took and that's

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
how i started to get obsessed with this

237
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,199
idea of going to these legislators

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,720
legislative hearings recording these

239
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,639
arguments filming them and posting them

240
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
live for everybody to be able to hear it

241
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
since then uh there have been a bunch of

242
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
different arguments that i'd like to

243
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
read to you so we've had in 2017

244
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,599
somebody from aham said that a

245
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,759
magtrometer will explode does anybody

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
here know what a magtrometer is

247
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
it doesn't exist good answer so there's

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
something called a magnetron inside of a

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,839
microwave these things don't explode has

250
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,519
anybody here ever heard of a magnetron

251
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,279
and a microwave exploding before

252
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
read about it on the news

253
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,320
hear about it from your friend happen in

254
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
your own place it's because it doesn't

255
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
happen so this person that doesn't even

256
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
know how to pronounce the part that goes

257
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,320
into a microwave was saying that

258
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
that

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
appliance technician shouldn't be able

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
to do these types of repairs because

261
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
things will explode

262
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
from somebody from the esa in 2020 in

263
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
washington while explaining why it's

264
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
important that you not be able to be

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
able to replace a fan in your game

266
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,279
console because that would be bad was

267
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
trying to explain the entire process but

268
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
how a game console works how anti-piracy

269
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
works she said that the game plays the

270
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
console

271
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
the game plays the console in

272
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
massachusetts independent auto there was

273
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
a right to repair bill on the ballot in

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,360
in 2020 and they had said that

275
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
they did this really really weird

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
commercial against this bill that allows

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,279
independent auto mechanics to get access

278
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,640
to the wireless telematics so that they

279
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
can read information on what's going on

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
with your car and they had a woman in a

281
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,279
parking lot she's walking over to her

282
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
car but right behind her with scary

283
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
string music playing there's a guy

284
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
walking over slowly and somebody in the

285
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
background scary music and it ends like

286
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
on this crescendo as the guy's about to

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
smash her in the neck or something and

288
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
they said vote no on question two

289
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,279
because if you allow independent

290
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,279
mechanics mechanics to be able to fix

291
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
your car apparently you're going to be

292
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
assaulted in a parking lot or they had

293
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,240
another one where there's a woman this

294
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
kind of old frail looking woman walking

295
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
into a garage and slowly going to the

296
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
door to enter her house and there's a

297
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,839
guy and he has like a cap on and he has

298
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
the green flannel shirt because we all

299
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,959
know all all people who wear green

300
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
flannel shirts are rapists and he's

301
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
slowly walking up like this into the

302
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
house and then he's goes right behind

303
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,839
the woman he goes to tap her on the

304
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,519
shoulder and she goes to scream and

305
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
before she can scream you hear

306
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
the narrator say vote no on question one

307
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
keep yourself safe

308
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,200
these are the arguments that uh that get

309
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
used and the real

310
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,519
depressing part here is that these

311
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
arguments don't win because of a lack of

312
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,560
money although we'll get to that

313
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
momentarily these arguments money simply

314
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
helps these arguments be put in front of

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
the right people these arguments win

316
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,519
because our culture has lost some

317
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,560
respect for the just the concept of

318
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
freedom and the idea that you should not

319
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,600
be able to have an independent mechanic

320
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
work on your vehicle because if the

321
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
independent mechanic works on your

322
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
vehicle then you you're going to get

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,519
stalked you're going to get beaten in a

324
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,880
parking lot that you might that your

325
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
macrometer is going to explode that your

326
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
game is going to play the console which

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,760
i think is the scariest one of these all

328
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
these are these all exist because our

329
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
culture has lost some respect for

330
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
freedom i want you to think about the

331
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
car a car is something that weighs 4 000

332
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
pounds that can go 70 miles an hour and

333
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
we completely accept that you should be

334
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,839
able to work on this car be able to work

335
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
on your brakes and fix the thing that

336
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
allows this 4 000 pound thing that can

337
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
go 70 miles down an hour down the road

338
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,880
we accept the fact that you should be

339
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
able to work on this to be able to fix

340
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
the brakes in your driveway and the

341
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
reason is because that's kind of

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
grandflothered in cars came out over 100

343
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
years ago and that was when we had a

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
different culture even when it comes to

345
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
something like let's say fixing a tube

346
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
amp or fixing a television or radio

347
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
shack selling tubes and stuff like that

348
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
we have 300 or 10 000 volts running

349
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
through it that happened 50 to 70 years

350
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
ago back when we had a little bit more

351
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
of a respect for freedom in our culture

352
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,760
and like a lot of the arguments that you

353
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
hear against right to repairs that it's

354
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,839
is that it's unsafe or insecure or this

355
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,120
that and the other i don't think that a

356
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
lot of these arguments would have worked

357
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
50 or 70 years ago and i'm trying to

358
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,079
bring that back and part of how i try to

359
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
bring that back is showing you i'm going

360
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,519
to work on all this stuff we're going to

361
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
do it live it's not going to be edited

362
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,560
we're going to like it you know run

363
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
power through a short this that and the

364
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,360
other and let's see if it turns on at

365
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
the end and look see i'm still here a

366
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,519
little older more gray hair and less of

367
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
it but still here but i can't blame that

368
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
on the repair now a lot of the argument

369
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,560
that you hear against right to repair is

370
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
that it's going to stifle innovation but

371
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
what many come people forget

372
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,079
is that many of the companies making

373
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
these arguments that the ability to

374
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,760
repair your own stuff is going to stifle

375
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
innovation forget that many of these

376
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
companies that are lobbying against this

377
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
started in a garage steve wozniak came

378
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
out in favor of right to repair it's

379
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
saying that this is what's going to

380
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,639
encourage the next

381
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,000
generation of engineers the next

382
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,680
generation of technicians and mechanics

383
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,959
people that are opening up stuff and

384
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,399
tinkering with it that have lost that

385
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,720
opportunity now yet the company that he

386
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
was a part of founding and engineering

387
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
their primary products in the early days

388
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,279
it comes out saying this is a bad thing

389
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,399
people who get into engineering

390
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,000
mechanics and programming start by

391
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
opening things up and messing with them

392
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
and we lose this more with each passing

393
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
year now

394
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
part of what i started doing was just

395
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
making videos to try and get people

396
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
involved to show them that this is uh

397
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
fun to show them that like how not only

398
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,040
how to fix their own stuff so that they

399
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
can save a little bit of money or get

400
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
that little kick-a-dope mean you get

401
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
when something works again but also so

402
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
that they can make a little bit of money

403
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
if you go to the apple store and they

404
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
say something is twelve hundred dollars

405
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
and the part is five dollars and it

406
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,839
takes a half hour of your time there's a

407
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,440
fair amount of profit margin to be made

408
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,959
there if you learn how to do this type

409
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,399
of stuff and a lot of what i've tried to

410
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
get across online is that you don't have

411
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,079
to have an engineering degree you don't

412
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,519
even have to have graduated high school

413
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
to understand some very basic simple

414
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
detective like con

415
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
concepts to be able to figure out how

416
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
these devices work and to be able to

417
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
make them work again when something dies

418
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,680
and part of what makes this fun is when

419
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
people will show up at my store and say

420
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
that you know thank you i used to work

421
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
as a cashier at walmart now i run my own

422
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
shop and i can afford to have a house

423
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
for my family and everything else once

424
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
you you makes you allow somebody to

425
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
either save money by get that little

426
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
kick of dope me when they make something

427
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,440
work again or make the money necessary

428
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,120
to make a living i think you have them

429
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
for life and this was very successful

430
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
and this is how i kind of accidentally

431
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,079
backdoored my way into being an activist

432
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,680
because i wasn't lecturing people on why

433
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
they should care but i was allowing them

434
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,760
to share in my fun and showing them how

435
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
close you are to not having any

436
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,350
[Music]

437
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
diesels rolling cold on my electric car

438
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
as i drive through rural pennsylvania

439
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,480
than i could ever imagine and the idea

440
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
is that activism is not about holding

441
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
signs or lecturing people from a place

442
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
of moral superiority it's about getting

443
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
people to join in your fun profit from

444
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
your passion and benefit from what

445
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
they're learning and that got right to

446
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,839
repair a really long way

447
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,079
but at the end of the day there it still

448
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,839
kind of reached its limits it did not

449
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
have you know again i started doing this

450
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
around 20 13 14 and five years in every

451
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,399
single state that i

452
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,800
testified in a bill would usually get

453
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
declined or laughed out of the

454
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
legislative chamber nothing really

455
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
changed no companies really changed any

456
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
of their behavior

457
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
and somebody called me out of the blue

458
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,360
in summer of 2020. and they asked what i

459
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
would do with a million dollars now at

460
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,560
this point i had a million subscribers

461
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
on youtube my store address is public um

462
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,839
i am used to you you imagine the amount

463
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
of prank calls i get with my phone

464
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,079
number being public in a million

465
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
subscribers so uh he's like what would

466
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,199
you what would you do with a million

467
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,839
dollars and i said hang up and click i

468
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,040
went back to what i was doing because i

469
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
was busy doing a board repair i go over

470
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
to my go over to my back office i said

471
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna continue my

472
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
stream that just got interrupted go back

473
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
to my board repair a 100 super chat

474
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
shows up and it says not a prank pick up

475
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
the phone

476
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,810
[Laughter]

477
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,079
[Music]

478
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:46,880
so

479
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
needless to say my board repair stream

480
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
ended early that day i'm listening there

481
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
was a silicon valley programmer on the

482
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,639
other line who had become a billionaire

483
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,920
and was tired of their culture of

484
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
control he suggested i start a nonprofit

485
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
and take right to repair advocacy a

486
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
little bit more seriously to keep doing

487
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,480
what i'm doing and offered a million

488
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
dollars with uh pretty much

489
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
two strings attached that i continue

490
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
doing what i was doing and that i not

491
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
sell out at this point i now work for

492
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,959
this organization that is looking for

493
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,399
all these different types of projects

494
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,680
that are dedicated to a goal of

495
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,759
restoring control over technology to

496
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
consumers and the users of that

497
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,959
technology that organization is called

498
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
futo they have been funding all these

499
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,480
different types of projects whether

500
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
through small grants with no strings

501
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,759
attached or investments in companies

502
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
that are focused on this main higher

503
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,320
concept at the end of the day right to

504
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
repair is a small thing under the

505
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
umbrella of control whether we're

506
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
talking about a medical company that

507
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,519
says you're not allowed to buy a motor

508
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
to fix this that requires that you spend

509
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
35 000 to replace an operating table

510
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
where everything works whether we're

511
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
talking about not being able to do basic

512
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
repairs on your car your tractor your

513
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
computer whether we're talking about a

514
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
cell phone with a locked boot loader so

515
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,560
i can't install an operating system of

516
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
my choice or we're talking about apple

517
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,839
and saying that you're not allowed to

518
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
install whatever apps you want on an

519
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
iphone that you own that you have to go

520
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,360
through them you're not allowed to

521
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,119
program an app for your device you after

522
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
you program it you have to kiss the ring

523
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
of tim cook to be able to install

524
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,679
something on it this all kind of goes

525
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
under the umbrella of control more and

526
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
more companies are focused on

527
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
controlling what you do with what you

528
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
own or if we're talking about

529
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
subscription models just taking away the

530
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,720
concept of ownership entirely whether

531
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
we're talking about bmw charging you a

532
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
subscription for heated seats in a car

533
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,480
that you already paid for the coils in

534
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
more software moving to a subscription

535
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
model hardware moving to a subscription

536
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,840
model it kind of falls into that

537
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
umbrella of control and what i'd like to

538
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
do is start pushing the movement not

539
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
just focusing on right to repair but

540
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
taking back control of our devices

541
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,320
taking back control of what we own most

542
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,880
people they don't see a smartphone as a

543
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
computer but that's what it is and the

544
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
idea that you can install an operating

545
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
system of your choice on a computer that

546
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,240
you spend a thousand dollars on would be

547
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
considered insane but we just kind of

548
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
accept it to the point where there are

549
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
very few choices that you actually have

550
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
and

551
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
this is something that i think we have

552
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
started to

553
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
reach the end of our rope with this

554
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
laptop that i'm using here is made by a

555
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,840
company called framework this is the

556
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
first laptop company that i know of to

557
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
create a usable mainstream laptop where

558
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
they will give people access to the

559
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
schematic to the motherboard so you do

560
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
not have to pirate it off of an ftp

561
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
server in romania and wonder if they're

562
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
going to hack your paypal account after

563
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
you after you pay them which is great

564
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
the entirety of this device is made to

565
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
be repairable so you can literally just

566
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,160
if you want to replace the screen it's

567
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
not something that's glued in there's no

568
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,440
screws you just take out for the bezel

569
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
or anything like that you do that

570
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
everything just comes right out of it

571
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
fair phone came out with a device that

572
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
has a user replaceable battery it's a

573
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
little bit more easy to work on but the

574
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
problem is still there that at the lower

575
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,080
levels of the tech stack whether it

576
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,799
comes to hardware or software it is

577
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,480
difficult to get things done so for

578
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
instance like fairphone does not make

579
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,919
schematics available for the motherboard

580
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,600
so that you so i can do the type of

581
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
repairs i do in my videos i don't blame

582
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
them for that i'm very confident they

583
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
most likely have some sort of nda there

584
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,679
under a contract they're under with the

585
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,120
company that makes the chip for the

586
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,480
modem and everything else that goes into

587
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,720
the device and this is where it's really

588
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
important that people that have the

589
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
amount of money as my new boss start to

590
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
get involved and find the companies that

591
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,840
are going to create the technologies

592
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
that compete with the existing ones so

593
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
that we can take back control of what we

594
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
own

595
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
that's about that so any questions

596
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
sure

597
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,840
we have a microphone coming

598
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
if anyone has questions for mr rossman

599
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
please stand in line

600
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,960
i do have a question from the matrix

601
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
chat

602
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,720
let me just find that question real

603
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
quick from jfred

604
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,799
what do you think about the same sort of

605
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
right to repair issues applied to

606
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
software for example

607
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
an iot security camera might have

608
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,919
vulnerable software that allows an

609
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
attacker to intercept the video feed

610
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
and when and oftentimes your only resort

611
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
is to scrap it and make more e-waste

612
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,039
instead of being able to fix it

613
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
i'm for it but i've had that be separate

614
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
from right to repair for uh for these

615
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,159
types of devices because i don't know

616
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,840
enough about programming to be able to

617
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
actually look at a bill and say this is

618
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
written in a manner where there's not

619
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,159
going to be unintended consequences of

620
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,520
side effects whereas i'm confident

621
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
enough about my tech my knowledge of

622
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
technology and the specific stuff that i

623
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
do to be able to read a bill and say

624
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,640
this is everything that we need and this

625
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,679
is not going to create a bunch of

626
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,360
unintended consequences or side effects

627
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
but i'm definitely i'm definitely

628
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
sympathetic to that particular cause

629
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
and there's and also adding on to that

630
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
there are certain things like section

631
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
1201 of the dmca where you're not

632
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
allowed to break a hardware or you're

633
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,360
not allowed to break a software lock on

634
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
something that you buy so that you may

635
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
actually purchase something it may be

636
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,960
insecure but you're not allowed to break

637
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,039
the digital lock on it to be able to fix

638
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,799
what makes it insecure because that's a

639
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,000
crime but and we are working towards

640
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
severely

641
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,840
kneecapping section 1201 of the dmca

642
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
that's active lobbying that's going on

643
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,679
right now so that you can actually break

644
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,440
a digital lock in order to work on the

645
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
devices that you want

646
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
i understand new york has a right to

647
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,880
repair law what does the law actually do

648
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
right now nothing it doesn't go into

649
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
effect until next year but what it would

650
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
do is it would allow people to get

651
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,520
access

652
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
assuming we're not talking about

653
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,320
tractors because the bill did exclude

654
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
tractors and certain police equipment it

655
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
would allow you to get access to the

656
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,400
parts schematics and diagrams that the

657
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
original equipment menu for the people

658
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
that are authorized by the original

659
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
equipment manufacturer to do repair get

660
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,080
access to so i would that now the the

661
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,679
issue there the hair that's going to be

662
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,760
split is let's say a company like apple

663
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
is going to say okay you get access to

664
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
everything the genius bar gets access to

665
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
which is virtually nothing have fun and

666
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,799
what our response to that is going to be

667
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,039
well you have a you know you have a

668
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,720
reverse logistics repair center you have

669
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,919
people like flextronics that are

670
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
actually doing board repair we want what

671
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
they get access to the schematics the

672
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,720
chipsets the screens all that kind of

673
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
stuff but what that law does is it

674
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
allows us once it goes into effect to

675
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
actually knock on their door and say we

676
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,520
would like to be able to buy this stuff

677
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
from you

678
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
another question from the matrix chat

679
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
this is more of a legal question but

680
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
could repairing your own system be seen

681
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
as a violation of the computer fraud and

682
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,520
abuse act

683
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,760
exceeding authorized access even though

684
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
you bought your device

685
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,799
i don't know enough about the computer

686
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,159
fraud and abuse act to be able to answer

687
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,360
that but i'd love to look into it

688
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
thanks for a great talk and i'm sorry

689
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
for not being familiar with your video

690
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
channel so this question may already be

691
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,919
answered but um would you consider

692
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,480
putting your videos up in um and

693
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
somewhere that's hosted by a non-evil

694
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
company instead of youtube

695
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
i actually have all my videos on library

696
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,799
and odyssey at the moment and uh there's

697
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
a uh

698
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
there's talks right now for the for the

699
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
person that's my boss to actually

700
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
purchase that to make sure that it stays

701
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
alive and stays as a proper entity and

702
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,400
um as a competitor to youtube because we

703
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
one of the things that we want to do is

704
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
ensure that competitors to youtube exist

705
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,480
whether it is the content that is

706
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,919
allowed or not allowed on youtube or

707
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,360
whether it's just the predatory way that

708
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
their algorithm works and just kind of

709
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
continues to funnel you down a rabbit

710
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,679
hole of garbage

711
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,039
one of the things our organization is

712
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
strongly focused on is ensuring that

713
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
there are alternatives to current social

714
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,080
media platforms and that's something

715
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,879
we're very committed to

716
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,559
another question from the matrix chat

717
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,880
sjn asks are you aware of other

718
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,280
organizations like yours in europe

719
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,559
canada or other countries

720
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
there's a i think there's repair.eu in

721
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,240
europe i don't know of any in canada

722
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,679
i've honestly just been focused on the

723
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
us like there's right now there's like

724
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,279
active lobbying going on in seven or

725
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,760
eight states so just trying to remember

726
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,279
everything that's going on the names of

727
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,400
the different people in the different

728
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
states in the u.s kind of boggles my

729
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,240
brain so i know that stuff's going on in

730
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
other countries but i just don't know it

731
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,080
off the top of my head

732
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
thinking back on

733
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
you mentioned some failures in

734
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,640
convincing

735
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
politicians to be on your side when it

736
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
comes to right to repair

737
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
thinking back on successes what do

738
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,679
politicians usually respond to how do

739
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,960
you convince them

740
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
well one of the things that helped again

741
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
ever since we got the grants from uh

742
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
from this organization i now work for we

743
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
were able to engage with the ftc and

744
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
actually you know we

745
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,799
we actually had time to have people

746
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,159
engage back and forth and say well

747
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,679
here's the you know here's what's

748
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,440
actually going on the ftc came out with

749
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
a 59-page paper called mixing the fix

750
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
and it went over with citations every

751
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,480
single argument the manufacturers made

752
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,360
and

753
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
mostly like very very politely said that

754
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
they were mostly

755
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
which was really helpful because instead

756
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
of saying look there's a guy on youtube

757
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,120
that wears a t-shirt and screams into

758
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
his camera that says the stuff is not

759
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,159
true i can now show up to a legislature

760
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,400
and say here's the ftc saying that all

761
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
of the stuff that you're hearing is not

762
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,279
true here's an executive order from the

763
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,279
president saying that all this stuff is

764
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
 should change because an executive

765
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
order got released by joe biden july of

766
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
last year the ftc came out with the

767
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,159
knicks in the fix report last year and

768
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,840
also this year the ftc took action

769
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
against they think westinghouse harley

770
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
davidson and some

771
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
grilling company weber grills i believe

772
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
so that stuff is really helpful because

773
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,279
it shows that that if they decide to

774
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
take action if they vote on a piece of

775
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
legislation that they're not going to

776
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,559
you know

777
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
have heads rolls from higher ups as a

778
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,760
result of passing something that

779
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,039
shouldn't have been passed once they

780
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,799
feel a little bit of wind underneath

781
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,159
their wings they're more than happy to

782
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,760
sign on to something like this

783
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
and that helped a lot because in the new

784
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
york state assembly i think this was

785
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
voted on 145 to one like you know again

786
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,840
these were people that were just

787
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
angry over the election angry over gun

788
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,200
rights angry over abortion and

789
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
everything else they were able to put

790
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
all that stuff down for five minutes to

791
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
say yeah i want to be able to fix my own

792
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,120
stuff which is pretty cool

793
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,080
another question from the matrix chat

794
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
are companies liable for their products

795
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
if a user modifying it maybe by

796
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,600
repairing it questioned by hoffman

797
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
i've heard this a lot the idea that what

798
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,000
if the user modifies the product then

799
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,080
the product explodes can they go back to

800
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
the manufacturer and sue them the

801
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
problem is i haven't i haven't seen the

802
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
citations like i've usually when i get

803
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
this comment i'll respond and say okay

804
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
can you give me some examples of this

805
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,799
happening in the manufacturer getting

806
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,320
screwed even though is the modularly

807
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
provable that the user screwed up their

808
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,159
own device and i just i don't hear the

809
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
cases i'd be open to hearing about these

810
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,200
cases i want to be able to dissect them

811
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
and go through them but i've never

812
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,679
actually seen a case of that happen

813
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
why are tractors so controversial in

814
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,039
right to repair

815
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
especially given that the large cost of

816
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,159
the implement and the large cost of

817
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,080
having people to come out like you said

818
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
to

819
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,520
just unblock a software aspect

820
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
disproportionately

821
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,120
affects like small farms versus like the

822
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
mega farms that the us is slowly moving

823
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,559
towards

824
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,080
this is a really confusing one and in

825
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
nebraska this is a very interesting

826
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
thing because in nebraska what

827
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,279
it was very strange because the people

828
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,360
that represented rural areas all voted

829
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,720
against right to repair yet the people

830
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
that represented cities where they have

831
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
no farmers as constituents all were

832
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,679
voting in favor of it and what really

833
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
makes this confusing is that the people

834
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
who were endorsed by the farm bureau or

835
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,120
the ones that voted against right to

836
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,799
repair yet the farm bureau is supposed

837
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,480
to be supporting right to repair in

838
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
nebraska they voted 176 to 1 in the

839
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,720
nebraska farm bureau to be in favor of

840
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
right to repair yet all the politicians

841
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,240
that were endorsed by the farm bureau

842
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
wound up voting against it and maryland

843
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
i remember when i was trying to get a

844
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,440
bill pushed there there was somebody

845
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
from the farm bureau that said something

846
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,600
along the lines of one second it was

847
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
farmers don't have like they don't have

848
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,039
the time or the inclination of the

849
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
knowledge to fix their own tractors the

850
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,159
real issue is a lack of service they

851
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,760
need more dealers i'm just thinking to

852
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
myself you represent farmers like people

853
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,000
pay dues to this organization if i were

854
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
to show your statement to the farmers

855
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,279
that pay dues to your organization they

856
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,440
would rip up their papers immediately so

857
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
something funky is going on there and i

858
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
haven't figured it out yet but i've been

859
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
digging for the past year but it's a

860
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
good question

861
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,679
and there's a related question that came

862
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,440
through the matrix chat is it illegal to

863
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,960
show that farmer how to reset their

864
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
tractor

865
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
uh the software that i believe they're

866
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
using is would be can i think it's

867
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,799
pirated software from from europe or

868
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,159
something that they're using

869
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
i'm not certain exactly how illegal it

870
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,919
is here but most of the farmers i've

871
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,120
spoken to that use it who i'm not going

872
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,080
to name don't seem to care

873
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,360
you don't want to wait two weeks for

874
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,120
their harvest so go ahead good morning

875
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
liz thank you um i was wondering if you

876
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
could go back in time and give yourself

877
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,600
advice on starting a youtube channel

878
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,960
what are some of the things that you

879
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,919
would tell yourself to focus on more or

880
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,320
focus on less thank you

881
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,880
if i knew that more than i i you thought

882
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,559
in the very beginning the maximum

883
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,080
audience i would have would be 300

884
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
people

885
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
because there was probably two or three

886
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
hundred people in the country back in

887
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,480
2012 and 2013 that are actually doing

888
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
component level board repair on apple

889
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
products specifically so like the

890
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,159
best case scenario 100 viewership will

891
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,000
be 300 people if i knew that this many

892
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,279
people would be watching i probably

893
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,559
would have

894
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,559
tried to present myself as more likeable

895
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,679
i would have presented myself as

896
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,200
somebody that was i would have been less

897
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
of an like just being honest

898
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
i i didn't expect that people would

899
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,799
actually watch this stuff if i knew that

900
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,000
people were gonna watch i'd probably

901
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,279
think about okay how would people

902
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,799
outside of my small circle of friends

903
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,760
see what i'm saying or understand it

904
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
another question from the matrix chat

905
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,880
from

906
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
presto pirate

907
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
you did mention framework and

908
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
as of one company that might fit this

909
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
but

910
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
how can we vote with our wallets uh what

911
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,640
other manufacturers would you recommend

912
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
to make repair easy this is a good this

913
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
that's a great one so you know the

914
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,159
primary tenant of capitalism is stop

915
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,760
giving money to people that are doing

916
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,039
things that you don't like and one of

917
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
the problems with this is if you want to

918
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,320
do that you're

919
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,240
for the most part up until very very

920
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
recently that meant buying a rotary

921
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,279
phone like for instance if you want to

922
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,200
buy a cell phone where you can get a

923
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,799
full schematic to the board so that you

924
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,480
can do the repairs i do without having

925
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,960
to do some sort of piracy or use the xw

926
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
tool or use some stuff that is using

927
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,159
stuff that's stolen what are your

928
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,760
choices what company will make a

929
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
smartphone that will give you access to

930
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,520
schematics that will tell the chips the

931
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,679
vendors feel free to sell a replacement

932
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,600
power chip to the phone like you can't

933
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,320
you know you want samsung no lg doesn't

934
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,000
exist anymore uh kyocera no sony no

935
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
apple definitely no like virtually every

936
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
company does this when it comes to

937
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,360
laptops if you want to be able to get

938
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
access to a schematic and immediately

939
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
you still have to sign an nda to get it

940
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
which is a partial compromise but not

941
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,520
the worst thing in the world

942
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
you have framework and

943
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
that's about it somebody linked me

944
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,520
downstairs to a arm laptop that has four

945
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
gigabytes of ram that's about this thick

946
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
that will give you a schematic and it's

947
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,200
like that's cool it's just like this

948
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
it's gonna fit like one or five percent

949
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,960
of use cases people that buy stuff so

950
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,039
when i people have asked me you know why

951
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,440
don't you come up with on your wiki a

952
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,799
list of all the companies that are doing

953
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,840
it right and it's like it would be a

954
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
blank

955
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,279
page it would be either that or i'd be

956
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,559
linking to stuff that you could buy that

957
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
was produced in the 80s so like the

958
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,840
problem with it right now is that it's

959
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,799
the the

960
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,200
we noticed this problem so late in that

961
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,320
you're kind of stuck becoming a um

962
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
a luddite if you actually want to have

963
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
technology that's repairable like with

964
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,679
tractors that's a good example you know

965
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
a lot of the people with track what

966
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,799
they're doing is they're just buying

967
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,240
tractors from the 70s and saying like

968
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
screw this i don't care if it's old not

969
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
only am i saving money by buying

970
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
something that's used but i don't have

971
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
to deal with this where i have to

972
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
wait two weeks for somebody from the

973
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,279
dealer to come out when they have an

974
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
appointment free as my you know my

975
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
harvest fails because i have no

976
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,799
equipment

977
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
a good question

978
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
that's so this is my first time actually

979
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,960
hearing you speak i apologize i'm not a

980
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,559
follower of your channel but i am like

981
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,080
so in sync with everything you said

982
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,720
today um i couldn't help to find a

983
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,080
similarity to

984
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,039
i call it like right to update so for

985
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,799
people who might own like smart vehicles

986
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,559
or electric vehicles

987
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,039
do you see any legislation that protects

988
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,000
owners of these vehicles to

989
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
not have to update or are there any

990
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,279
legislations coming out that's

991
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,159
influencing for good or bad how this is

992
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
impacting people now that own smart cars

993
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,960
that maybe don't want the update

994
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,399
i haven't heard about that to be honest

995
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,919
with you but i agree that you should be

996
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,440
able to choose what updates you put on

997
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
your own car like there's uh what is it

998
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,679
there like for instance i know that

999
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
tesla recently they did something where

1000
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
they lowered the max speed of autopilot

1001
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,159
or something from like 90 to 80 or 85

1002
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,279
um and

1003
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,120
most users that they woke up to a

1004
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,720
surprise that day were like oh i bought

1005
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
it with disability now i have it with

1006
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,240
that ability exactly

1007
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
yeah okay that was interesting thank you

1008
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,120
another question from the matrix chat

1009
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
corporations tend to only listen to

1010
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,039
money is there a way to frame the rights

1011
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,720
or repair argument to convince them it's

1012
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
more profitable for their hardware and

1013
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
software to be reparable

1014
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
yeah there's a one particular investment

1015
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
firm i think it's called as you sow or

1016
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
something like that that wound up filing

1017
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
a shareholder resolution with microsoft

1018
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,080
last year their idea is that not only is

1019
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,200
this the right thing to do but we think

1020
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,279
you'll make more money if you create a

1021
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,559
product and you can differentiate

1022
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
yourself in the marketplace if the

1023
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,919
surface is fixable and the ipad is a

1024
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,279
glued together piece of that when

1025
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,279
it dies sucks to be you that is

1026
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,320
something that's going to differentiate

1027
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
you in the marketplace why are we not

1028
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,320
doing this and that was one a couple of

1029
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,600
the organizations that i was able to

1030
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,559
fund with the donation from my generous

1031
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,880
donor who's now my boss was able was

1032
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,720
able to you know pretty much go knock

1033
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,240
door to door say okay do you know why

1034
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,000
this is an issue and one of the people

1035
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
that they knocked on on the door of that

1036
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
said do you know this is an issue was an

1037
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,880
investment firm that had a fairly large

1038
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
stake in microsoft and this was a

1039
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,679
shareholder resolution that i think was

1040
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
announced in june or july of last year

1041
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,279
so there are ways to frame it in terms

1042
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,799
of you can actually differentiate

1043
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,120
yourself from the pack by doing this

1044
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
if you decide to sell a device that can

1045
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
easily be serviced rather than one that

1046
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
is again a disposable glue together

1047
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,840
piece of in my opinion

1048
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,480
um hi lewis i i'm one of the people

1049
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,600
who's been following you on youtube for

1050
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,039
a long time i just wanted to say thank

1051
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
you for being a grumpy new yorker

1052
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,480
thank you

1053
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,160
[Laughter]

1054
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,969
[Applause]

1055
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,279
okay actually we have another question

1056
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,760
through the matrix chat

1057
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,399
bmw is using a new business model where

1058
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,320
they charge for features

1059
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,719
like heated seats

1060
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
imagine trying to quote unquote repair

1061
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,079
seats that you already own to do

1062
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,040
something they can already do

1063
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
uh do you have any suggestions on what

1064
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,239
could be done

1065
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,040
to try and preclude or prevent this i i

1066
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,560
think i can predict exactly where this

1067
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,239
is going so when you unlock your boot

1068
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,359
loader on a phone that is a locked

1069
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,040
bootloader it'll trip a flag and your

1070
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,639
warranty is void so i would not be

1071
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,480
surprised if when you spend eighty

1072
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,079
thousand dollars in your car and you

1073
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,440
commit the crime of flashing the

1074
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,639
software so that the seat heater that

1075
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,000
you already paid for actually effing

1076
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
works that they wind up saying okay your

1077
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,679
warranty is now void on the transmission

1078
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,040
the engine and everything else i

1079
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,879
wouldn't be surprised if that is where

1080
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,679
that winds up going um i when i posted

1081
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,599
that there were people saying you know

1082
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
even if they were only charging a dollar

1083
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
a month for that on principle alone i'm

1084
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
ripping apart my seat and attaching a

1085
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
battery and a switch to the heater the

1086
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
heating element just on principle alone

1087
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
now i do think they did update that and

1088
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
said that you can technically pay the

1089
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,240
additional for the sea heater up front

1090
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
but it's just still like it's just weird

1091
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
like you paid for it it's in your car

1092
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,320
already

1093
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
i think that there has to be some sort

1094
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,320
of limitation on two things a section

1095
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
1201 of the dmca you cannot get around a

1096
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
software a hardware lock that's illegal

1097
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,599
if you buy it you should be able to

1098
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
unlock whatever's in there and we are

1099
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,359
already doing active lobbying work to

1100
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
kind of kneecap section 1201 of the dmca

1101
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,680
with again the help of a generous donor

1102
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
and the second thing that has to be done

1103
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
is

1104
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
oh is that

1105
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
yeah section 121 of the dmc oh the

1106
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,520
second thing is warranty enforcement

1107
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,119
what you are allowed and are not allowed

1108
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,520
to void a warranty for so the ftc has

1109
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,960
been going after companies like whether

1110
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,200
it's weber grill weber grills or

1111
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
westinghouse or harley-davidson for

1112
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
avoiding warranties illegally you and

1113
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
part of that i think is going to have to

1114
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
be you can't void the warranty on the

1115
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
device if somebody unlocks a feature of

1116
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,160
their device

1117
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,160
so question for me

1118
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
what would you suggest to somebody that

1119
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
wants to get started doing some of your

1120
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,200
type of work to do low level work on

1121
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
hardware such as you

1122
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,560
i would say buy really really cheap

1123
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,480
stuff on ebay and give yourself easy win

1124
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
so and don't buy a 2 000 macbook that's

1125
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
broken for like 1600 on ebay and then

1126
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,240
try to do some repair butcher it lose

1127
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
all your money and go oh my god i can't

1128
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,200
believe i did that i'm so stupid it

1129
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
didn't work i give up you have to give

1130
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
yourself little wins i would say let's

1131
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,079
say buy something cheap like an acer

1132
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,359
5517 from 2010 for 50 bucks buy and buy

1133
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,119
three of them that all work you could

1134
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,560
probably get that for a hundred dollars

1135
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
take one chip off the board and then put

1136
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,079
it back on not it doesn't have to be a

1137
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,560
lot a cpu or a bga chip or a qfn just

1138
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,320
take like the bios strip legs on it

1139
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,839
something big and then just put it back

1140
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,480
on see that it works and go yes i did it

1141
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,640
it still works that's a victory then

1142
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
take off something smaller maybe like a

1143
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
fuse or a capacitor and then put it back

1144
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
on have a little victory when that works

1145
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
yes it works then you do it with a qfn

1146
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
chip and you do it with a then you'll

1147
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
just keep going smaller and smaller do

1148
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,240
it with a micro bga and

1149
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
so you kind of get the skills but each

1150
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,920
time you do something even the smallest

1151
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,720
thing

1152
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
give yourself

1153
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,839
give yourself like a little internal

1154
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,599
round of applause like i did it and it

1155
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,720
still works that's actually an

1156
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,960
accomplishment you know when i i started

1157
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,280
teaching a class in 2015 with jessa

1158
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
jones at ipad rehab was great and there

1159
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,720
were people that after the week or the

1160
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
second week was done would say i only

1161
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
fix two or three things while i'm here i

1162
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,359
don't really feel like i got a lot done

1163
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
and i have to take them aside and say i

1164
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
tried to fix my first uh one of these

1165
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
motherboards and i think 2009 i got my

1166
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,800
first successful one in 2013. so like

1167
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
don't don't give

1168
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,280
you know don't don't sell yourself short

1169
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
there so i would say start with really

1170
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,880
really small victories and slowly build

1171
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,960
up to larger ones because the thing is

1172
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
with this particular type of work

1173
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,160
there's some sort of impasta syndrome

1174
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,839
that goes on and i've seen it i've hired

1175
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,599
dozens of people to do this type of work

1176
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,119
people that were that you know are

1177
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,640
united states marines that did this type

1178
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,680
of work in the marine corps that have

1179
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
way more training than me if you get two

1180
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
or three failures in a row it doesn't

1181
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,880
matter if you had a thousand or six

1182
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
thousand positive fixes in the past it

1183
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
doesn't matter if they've been filmed if

1184
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
you have had five star reviews on yelp

1185
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
for it you still kind of go but am i

1186
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
really good at this or are those all

1187
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,400
flukes like do i really know what i'm

1188
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,520
doing do i actually know how to

1189
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
troubleshoot and fix a board maybe i

1190
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
don't you need you need to give yourself

1191
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,760
successes and the way you give yourself

1192
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,680
success is do something really really

1193
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,760
easy and simple see that it works and

1194
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,119
allow yourself to give yourself a pat in

1195
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,440
the back

1196
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
and we have more questions coming in

1197
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,480
through the matrix chat

1198
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
how can we explain the importance of

1199
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,160
right to repair to normal people who are

1200
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,200
happy with their locked down products

1201
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
additionally

1202
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
on a related note how do you deal with

1203
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,200
flood coming from manufacturers

1204
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
regarding repairing

1205
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,359
their hardware example that was given in

1206
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,040
the chat was for instance people being

1207
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,839
warned with microwaves because it could

1208
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,800
send

1209
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,480
voltage to your body

1210
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
uh so for the first part of it how do

1211
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
you get normal people that are happy

1212
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
with the way things are you don't and

1213
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,160
that's what goes back to the greater

1214
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
thunderberg how dare you comment that i

1215
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,040
made which is if you try to lecture

1216
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,320
somebody or tell them you should care

1217
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
about this because it matters

1218
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,280
you could try that until you're blue in

1219
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
the face and you may get them to nod but

1220
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
at the end of the day most people care

1221
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,640
about something when they're

1222
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,880
self-interest so for me if again if

1223
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
somebody has something that's broken i

1224
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
will focus on it at that point here you

1225
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,760
had you thought you had to spend a

1226
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
thousand dollars to fix your car here it

1227
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
actually only cost 87 bucks you have to

1228
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
get them personally invested or if

1229
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
you're talking about let's say

1230
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
let's say you know they figure out how

1231
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,200
to fix something themselves they're and

1232
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,480
they're happy with the result of it or

1233
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,079
that they're happy you know at that

1234
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,599
moment you can explain this is something

1235
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,680
that's about to be taken away or if

1236
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
again one of the ways my channel gets

1237
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
people involved is i'll say at the end

1238
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,720
of it if you think you could do work

1239
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
like this and you're broke here's how

1240
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,920
much money you can make doing this type

1241
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,200
of work and it gets people a little bit

1242
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,359
more personally invested most people at

1243
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,800
the end of the day care about their own

1244
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,560
self-interest so getting normal people

1245
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,320
involved and excited it happens when you

1246
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,760
when you can see that there's a chance

1247
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
like do it at the moment where you

1248
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,119
believe that their life can be made

1249
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,040
better as a result of having repair in

1250
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,119
it otherwise it's not going to in terms

1251
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,079
of dealing with fud uh i i honestly i

1252
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,280
just film it and put it on youtube for

1253
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
people to laugh at and what that does is

1254
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
it gets that gets people involved

1255
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
because again there's this idea

1256
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
never ask a question on the internet

1257
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
just tell people how to do it wrong and

1258
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,240
wait for them to correct you

1259
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
this works so great on stack overflow i

1260
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,480
built the website doing this but it also

1261
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,200
but if if you just post this is what

1262
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,359
this manufacturer said this is what the

1263
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,520
lobby has said post the esa saying the

1264
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,160
game will play the console so

1265
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,079
people will naturally do the work for

1266
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,520
you you won't have to ask people to

1267
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
correct it people that understand what's

1268
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,200
going on will be so angry they will tell

1269
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,560
everybody they know they will share with

1270
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,319
everybody they know and eventually that

1271
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,079
network of people will slowly make its

1272
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,599
way back to somebody that's an assistant

1273
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,200
or an aide to a politician that is

1274
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
voting no on a bill to get them to vote

1275
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
yes and that's what i've been doing i

1276
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,520
know i'm not going to convince the

1277
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
politician directly the idea is to

1278
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,400
convince this circle of people that

1279
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,440
convince this circle of people that

1280
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,800
convinced this circle of people that

1281
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
eventually tap on the shoulder of

1282
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,440
somebody and go that person said the

1283
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,040
game plays the console doesn't know jack

1284
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,160


1285
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,760
so when they talk to you about piracy or

1286
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,440
how dangerous it is to replace a fan or

1287
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,359
a cd drive don't listen to them anymore

1288
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,280
thank you everyone online for asking

1289
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,040
your questions

1290
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,200
so when other questions come from the

1291
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,359
from the matrix chat you have mentioned

1292
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,440
farmers a couple times today

1293
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,280
farmers and certain other blue collar

1294
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,640
worker groups

1295
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,200
get much better pr than hackers do

1296
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
and the public gets mad about say

1297
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,520
denying the right to repair from

1298
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,319
to farm equipment or perhaps like a like

1299
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,839
a big rig

1300
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,960
then

1301
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,200
that way they don't for phones are you

1302
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
talking directly to those people or

1303
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
groups or

1304
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,359
associated with them at all can we get

1305
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,359
them on tv or something

1306
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,720
are you talking about the group's

1307
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
farmers or with phones

1308
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
farmers for example

1309
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
from what i gather is that farmers for

1310
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,599
example are a great i mean the public

1311
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,960
has more sympathy for farmers for

1312
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,440
example than they would for hackers

1313
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
so perhaps the question is about

1314
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,599
talking directly to farmers and farm

1315
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,079
groups having them be pr the faces for

1316
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,560
pr purposes

1317
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
that's something we've been working on

1318
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
over the past year a lot of them they

1319
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
honestly just want to do their job and

1320
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,720
they don't want cameras in front of them

1321
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,920
they don't want to be on tv they don't

1322
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,599
want to be in the spotlight and they

1323
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
like the idea of having some somebody

1324
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,400
else speak for them but one of the

1325
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,520
things that i'll bring up is like you

1326
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,000
know i grew up in brooklyn like you know

1327
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200

1328
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
brooklyn i don't know how to use a

1329
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,839
tractor i can barely i could barely take

1330
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,359
care of a venus fly trap i took home in

1331
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,560
fourth grade it would be great if you

1332
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,000
guys could explain these issues as well

1333
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,119
and it is something that we'd like to do

1334
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,839
in the future

1335
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,720

1336
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,000
