2
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
welcome again to the final afternoon of

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
hope

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,800
for attendees that are here

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160

our closing ceremonies overflow is going

7
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,879
to be in room 206 and not the little

8
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,840
theater

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,080

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,960
and now on to our next talk

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,479
whether we're talking about commercial

14
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,000
products like audit

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,119
sorry

16
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,720
allergies

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,200
non-profit projects like librivox or

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
community project or projects for the

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
community such as reading talking books

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
such as reading for the blind audio

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
audiobook production is nowhere near as

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
straightforward as it might seem

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
to tell us more about what happens

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
behind the scenes and how

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,880
how it gets how it gets done

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,759
a good friend neo

27
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
thank you thank you all

28
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
and uh i just before we begin uh there

29
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,360
was a talk i think was here yesterday um

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
one of the rooms where we were talking

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
about the history of hotel pennsylvania

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
we omitted something rather important we

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,399
forgot to thank the staff of hotel

34
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,320
pennsylvania for hosting us and putting

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
up with us for all those years

36
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,119
so corrections out of the gate

37
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
all right so

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
thank you for showing up

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,200
what we're talking about is writing for

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
the ear and now writing typically means

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
ink pen typewriter print paper it's a

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
visual medium

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when we're writing for the ear we are

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
transmuting

45
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
print

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,840
into audio

47
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,000
so the scope of the talk covers a lot of

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
things you'll hear phrases like talking

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
book audio book radio dramatization

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
lectures i want to address them because

51
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
we sometimes use the word talking book

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
to cover a lot of things or audiobook to

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
cover a lot of things

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,480
so i'm going to start with a couple of

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
definitions about what is in scope of

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
this document

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
first and foremost what's within scope

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
is the talking book

59
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
the point of the talking book very

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
simply is to transmute the words from

61
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,879
the visual medium into audio such that

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,319
the printed copy is not necessary

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,159
that's an important point because not

64
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
only is a book it's content but it's

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
also navigable so some of you will have

66
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
older dictionaries at home and you'll

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
remember those little finger creases

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,959
that you can put on the side

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,680
so you can rapidly get to letter x or q

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
or h or o or p or e

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
that has to be translated into audio as

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,159
well

73
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
a talking book will focus on that and i

74
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
happen to have a record here for an

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,799
example

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,720
of jorge luis borges as a talking book

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
an audio book on the other hand makes

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
the written word available

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,760
in addition to or instead of print

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
so douglas adams read his own work and

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,319
uh it's not a bad read it's not as fun

82
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
as the radio play but he read his own

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
work and that is an audio book

84
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
on the border of what's on the scope of

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
this uh talk is going to be

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
recitations and recitals so morges

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,480
reading his own work reading his own

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
poetry

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,439
or george carlin's famous modern man

90
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
i'm a modern man digital smoke-free

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
ready for the millennium that's more of

92
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
a recital of poetry

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
but they do fall under the same heading

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
and there is some overlap between

95
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,959
what's beyond the scope are

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
dramatizations making words come to life

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,160
and there you have the bbc radio series

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
for the hitchhiker's guide which

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
everybody's familiar with i'm sure

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,040
lectures

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
borges again i harp on borges for a

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
couple of different reasons

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,320
but he gave some lectures called this

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
craft a verse basically it's the same

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
thing that's happening here speaking

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
about metaphor and lecture

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
and talking about the uncouthness of

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
certain phrases in translation

109
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
and finally with a shameless plug to rob

110
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,280
and gila who are not with us and they

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
are hope

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
uh

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
institutions

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
podcasts because podcasts you don't

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
start with the written word podcasts

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
just are the audio

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
so with that in mind and while i bonk a

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
second laptop out of position

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
we're going to move on to

120
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
the next part which is pre-production so

121
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
in any audio video image what have you

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
you have different phrases phases you

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,639
have pre-production production and

124
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,320
post-production

125
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
in the pre-production phase you have to

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
make certain decisions like is this book

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
worth reading and i'm going to just

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
start with the hot five that you should

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
never read first off bibles we are sick

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
and tired of bibles

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
bibles are everywhere everybody's got a

132
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
free copy of the bible you can get it

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
for five cents you can get it for free

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
librivox has a copy whatever your

135
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
denomination is i assure even the quran

136
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
has been read the tanakh has been read

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
everything has been read

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
another one children's books

139
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
children's books are very demanding

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
to read to a child is like teaching in

141
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
order to teach you have to do a lot of

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
prep work

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
and you have to enunciate from time to

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
time and know when to emphasize

145
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,039
leave it to the professionals you're

146
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
just going to drive yourself crazy

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
what's the demand for the book does the

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
book already exist who's your target

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
audience do you have the time to

150
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
complete these books

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
do you have the talent the funding

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
do you have the copyright clearances

153
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
and when it comes to fanfic

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,919
theoretically you have your own

155
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
clearances but trust me guys listen to

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,199
me

157
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,240
nobody

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
nobody wants your copy of 50 shades of

159
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
gray beard with the nft tattoo don't

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
read it

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
and finally hot books and this is where

162
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
tech comes into a bit of a problem

163
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
because hot books means these are books

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
that are going to be updated regularly

165
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,000
if i write a book about cyber security

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
if i write

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
it by the time it hits the press it's

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
out of date

169
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,240
by the time you get the audio book

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
recording of it it's not only out of

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
date academia is ahead of you

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,039
so you might want to avoid doing those

173
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,160
things

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
and consider books that might be worth

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,400
reading like magazines periodicals

176
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
serialized works the reason for that is

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,120
your time commitment your energy

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,160
commitment

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
to complete these products

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
is a big commitment so you have to

181
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,520
really think about it

182
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
from that pre-production position we now

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
move on to how to read and record so

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
let's say that you've been through your

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
work you've decided that the book that

186
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,520
you have in your head is worth the

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
recording

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
well first off you have to read clearly

189
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
you can hear a little bit of dryness in

190
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
my mouth

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
just a slight amount

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
it has to be clear consistent

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
coherent and the word really you're

194
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
looking for is authoritative you are a

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
representation of the book

196
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
going back to our example of the

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,039
hitchhiker's guide simon jones is the

198
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
voice of the book

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
when you hear simon jones's voice you

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,520
hear the book and it's presented as i

201
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
know what i'm speaking about

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
you are speaking on behalf of the author

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,039
who may or may not be reading it

204
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,840
themselves

205
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,759
the next up is we have two pieces of

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,000
guidance now i work in accordance with

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
the guidelines of the national library

208
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
service of the library of congress

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
because i produce talking books for the

210
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
blind the visually impaired the reading

211
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,400
disabled and people who physically

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
cannot hold a book in their hands

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
so

214
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
the guideline that i've been following

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
way up here

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
is billy west's

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
the art and science of audiobook

218
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
production it's a great crash course it

219
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
gives you some background information

220
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
and it's a very high standard

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
and it's intentionally to be high

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,559
standards

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
the other one with librivox they have

224
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,279
their own little wiki they have their

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,958
own policy pages and guidelines but you

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
will find the storytellers recording

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,519
guide

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
so refer to them

229
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,080
in the case of art and science of

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,839
book production

231
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
nls reorganized their website recently

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
but fortunately somebody

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
decided to archive it on internet

234
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,399
archive so it is there if you want to

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
read it

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
so those are your guidelines but we have

237
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,600
to conform to rules so librivox has its

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
policies regarding recording

239
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
text music and sound effects i'll spare

240
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,880
you a click no

241
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
languages

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
they have their guidelines their rules

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
so does the national library service and

244
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
those specs that you see up there are

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
what i deal with every day

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
ranging from narration

247
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
talking book mastering construction of

248
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
the books construction of magazines and

249
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
preparation of audio files from

250
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,600
pre-recorded commercial works

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
and even in the commercial world amazon

252
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
and find a way voices will have their

253
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
audio requirements

254
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
before you begin recording

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
learn these requirements those are your

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
goal posts it's not just about the

257
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
reading

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
and you have to learn from others and

259
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
i'm just throwing it up there

260
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
which i can't pronounce properly so i

261
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,920
should not read that book

262
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
instead we'll leave it to michael doran

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
and roxanne dawson because they are

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
friggin awesome and klingon is a very

265
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
interesting language

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
so once you're familiar with all these

267
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
rules

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
we start talking about the hardware

269
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
you're going to use

270
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,839
so i've broken this down into four

271
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,519
sections first and foremost don't use

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
all-in-one field production units

273
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
just don't

274
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
and i'll cover a couple of reasons why

275
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,240
not but the basic one is there are many

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
programs where you are recording from

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
home

278
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,279
even in this room

279
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,240
there is a little background sound

280
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
i can hear the projector up ahead i can

281
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,440
hear some fans and ventilation

282
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,399
the room has an echo to it

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
if you record at home and this is pretty

284
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,079
well soundproofed and reinforced by the

285
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,920
speakers on the side

286
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
in your own home where do you have such

287
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,399
silence

288
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,720
and also most people when they record

289
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,839
they don't have the microphone facing

290
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
them they'll have a little object on the

291
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,320
table pointed towards their mouth

292
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
while they're reading a book off at an

293
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
angle

294
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,600
now i'm off at an angle

295
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
i'm reading the book i'm trying to focus

296
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
on the print in front of me you'll

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
notice that nobody can hear me because

298
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
i'm not on the microphone i have to turn

299
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,640
in order to face the microphone my

300
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,720
levels go down and if you're recording

301
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
alone and you don't have the audio

302
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,079
feedback and you don't have a director

303
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,839
it becomes very difficult

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
the other issue is most people put those

305
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
devices on a table

306
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
a table

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
has echo to it

308
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,880
it will reinforce create reverberation

309
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,279
and you end up creating a very decent

310
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,439
reading but a very bad recording

311
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
so that's one of the reasons why i don't

312
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
recommend it the other is a lot of the

313
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
units don't have the specifications you

314
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
need to know

315
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
you need to know is this microphone

316
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
omnidirectional picking up everything

317
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
around it

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
is it hypercardiod facing one direction

319
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
you need to know what noise itself it

320
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
brings into the chain

321
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
so all these details tend to be missing

322
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
from the recorded home units

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
and the most important part is how do

324
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
you know if it's powered on

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,959
how do you know if you've run out of

326
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
storage space how do you know if it's

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
working at all

328
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,440
you may record three hours and

329
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,639
not have anything to show for it

330
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
so the easier parts are storage now

331
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
storage is very simple anything capable

332
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,120
of sustaining one megabyte per second

333
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
actually it's 1.1

334
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
in those first specs i'm taking dj

335
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
standards which is a sample rate of 192

336
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,639
kilohertz 24 bits stereo

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
you will mostly be recording at cd

338
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,720
quality or dat quality the requirements

339
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
as you can see are

340
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
greatly reduced

341
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
but also you'll probably be recording in

342
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,399
mono

343
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,240
with microphones we have a prime example

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
of a microphone right here it's the

345
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,680
generic shure sm 58

346
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,519
it's a classic it picks up in one

347
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,639
direction

348
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,920
dynamic

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,079
at the place where i work we use shure

350
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
sm7bs they're unidirectional dynamic

351
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
microphones very popular with speed with

352
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
streamers youtube channels

353
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
instagram you'll you'll see it

354
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
everywhere

355
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
we used to use the electro voice re27nd

356
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
it was a cardioid dynamic microphone had

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,399
neodymium drivers and it was very close

358
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,839
to what we would call a condenser mic in

359
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,320
terms of its pickup it did not forgive

360
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
anything

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
if you had lunch an hour ago we knew

362
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,800
if you farted we knew

363
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
if the elevator behind the studio room

364
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,519
where we were recording was going up or

365
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,800
down we

366
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
knew

367
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,399
your cell phone is basically a condenser

368
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,600
microphone

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
it is unforgiving it's cheap it's small

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
it picks up everything and if you want

371
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
an example of it try to make a phone

372
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
call to somebody who you really need to

373
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,959
speak to on a busy avenue and try to

374
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,240
hear them

375
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
over the background noise

376
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
most of the all-in-one units are

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,160
condenser microphones so splurge the

378
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
extra if you can

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
borrow i'm not going to say steal but

380
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
beg if you have to and get full

381
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
equipment

382
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
the last item is not a microphone

383
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
it's actually focusrite 2i4 second

384
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
generation the reason we have is because

385
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
these microphones have a connector

386
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
called an xlr cable connector

387
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
basically signal negative signal ground

388
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,079
and shielding and that's the connector

389
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,120
right here

390
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
we use these focusrite devices to

391
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,600
convert from the analog connector of the

392
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
xlr into a usb device

393
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
it just digitizes for you nice and easy

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,440
finally headphones because you need to

395
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
be able to hear yourself if you're

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
working in a team maybe you happen to

397
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
have access to a studio you need to be

398
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,079
able to hear your director giving you

399
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
instructions and you also need to hear

400
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,839
yourself

401
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,639
so

402
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,519
typically in our studios we'll use an

403
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,120
mdr7506 they're very comfortable they

404
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,279
are soft padded they're not open to the

405
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,040
world it's not like having an open

406
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
speaker

407
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
the cable is corded and it allows you

408
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
some freedom of movement so you can

409
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
reposition

410
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
as you're reading

411
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,440
they're

412
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,320
not expensive i'll i'll be honest about

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,839
that they might be a little more

414
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
say a project would start at about 250

415
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
so of all that equipment you can pretty

416
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
much do a lot of it getting away on the

417
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
cheap and easy the first couple of times

418
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
but do not and i i really i have to

419
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,279
emphasize this do not use open ear

420
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
open headphones anything that causes

421
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
feedback

422
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
so for example

423
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
i happen to like my cheap speakers 29

424
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
and if they break who cares because

425
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
they're only 29 bucks but they have

426
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
enough frequency response that you can

427
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,399
hear your own voice you don't need

428
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
studio engineering speakers that go from

429
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,959
20 to 20 000 hertz you need a narrow

430
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,120
range roughly between 105 kilohertz

431
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
uh don't use in ear earbuds

432
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,399
that's going to leak all the audio it's

433
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,519
going to come back to your microphone

434
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,959
you get a feedback

435
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,320
the final one and i know a lot of people

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
like headsets i happen to like headsets

437
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
but don't use a bluetooth headset please

438
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,600
don't

439
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,519
bluetooth is notorious for its latency i

440
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,639
know it's getting better and better all

441
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
the time but by the time you start a

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
sentence

443
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,519
have it transmitted over bluetooth

444
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,440
arrive at the computer commit it to disk

445
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
have the computer play it back to you go

446
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,199
over bluetooth and come back to your ear

447
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,680
you have already lost anywhere from

448
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
20 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds very

449
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,360
easily it will distract you it will slow

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,759
you down and you'll just be frustrated

451
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,120
to the point where you can't continue

452
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,079
software very simple and most of you

453
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,639
probably have two out of these four uh

454
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,440
the first one is the aph studio recorder

455
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,279
it's popular with our studios because

456
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,440
it's very easy for volunteers to use

457
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
it's sort of the dumbest recorder you

458
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
can possibly have and it works

459
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
for post-production as well as recording

460
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
we can use the hindenburg audio book

461
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
creator we use a specific version made

462
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
for the national library service and

463
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
affiliates

464
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
that's what allows us to take the

465
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
recordings and turn them into

466
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
full-fledged talking books digital

467
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
talking books ready to be serviced and

468
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,559
given to patrons of the library of

469
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
congress who are blind visually impaired

470
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
and reading disabled

471
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
audacity ah yes

472
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
the audio editing software made by

473
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,959
programmers for programmers

474
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,799
but there ain't nothing else

475
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
i mean realistically speaking

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,720
you could use socks i mean you could

477
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,200
just say pull dev input mic 0 and commit

478
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
to disk

479
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
and just do live recordings and edit it

480
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
afterwards but audacity really is the

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
only game in town the other audio

482
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
software that exists on linux is mostly

483
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,559
driven for music and you're not

484
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,760
necessarily making music you are making

485
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,559
a

486
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
recording of audio a voice

487
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,559
it's a very different beast

488
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
so we've talked about hardware we've

489
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
talked about software time to talk about

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
underwear your talent

491
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
now your talent breaks down into

492
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
basically four people a narrator

493
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,400
director and an engineer so the narrator

494
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
translates the written word and i'm

495
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
going to read off of this guy because my

496
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
my the laptop is shot

497
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
the narrator translates the written word

498
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
to the spoken word in a way that is as

499
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
consistent as possible with the intent

500
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,760
of the author thank you bill west for

501
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
writing that you saved me a lot

502
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
so the job of the narrator is to

503
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
be the author be authoritative

504
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
the engineer controls all technical

505
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,799
operations during a recording session

506
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
allowing the narrator to devote full

507
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
attention and effort to the act of

508
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
narration

509
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,120
so

510
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
checking your levels making sure that

511
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
you're not over plusing the mic

512
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
that you are in fact talking to the

513
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
microphone

514
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,160
that's his job or her job or their job

515
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
making sure the computer is running

516
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
making sure that you have storage space

517
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
that's their job the director has a

518
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
harder job the director is sort of like

519
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
a driver you know when you drive on a

520
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
road you have to look at the road you

521
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,679
have to look at the traffic you have to

522
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
remember the you know what the lights

523
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,960
mean what the rules of the road are when

524
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
you try to make a left turn make sure

525
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,080
you're not speeding the director has

526
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,679
multiple roles and basically the

527
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
director is responsible for quality

528
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
assurance of the content and its

529
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,200
continuity

530
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
they are the first listener of your

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
audiobook

532
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,280
now i'm saying listener for a reason

533
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
because there's also a first reader of

534
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
the book these books are red so the

535
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
director is concerned with tonality

536
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,720
inflections pronunciation enunciation

537
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
energy levels whether you are reading

538
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
correctly

539
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
they're also looking for digestion

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,320
noises or if you pick your nose and it

541
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
has to show up on the microphone they're

542
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
going to stop you if you sound tired if

543
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
you sound dry

544
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,640
and they also basically keep the

545
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
recording record that is to say metadata

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
about the recordings

547
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,679
finally

548
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
there's quality control but before i

549
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,160
continue to quality control because it's

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
another stage

551
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
don't try to do all three of these

552
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,160
things at once

553
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
because you can't be and i'm going to

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
just try this right now and you're

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
seeing it right now i'm trying to read

556
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
stay on the microphone check my levels

557
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
check the clock make sure that i'm okay

558
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
i've lost track of where i was where was

559
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
i

560
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,600
you end up doing a lot of frustrating

561
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,200
work trying to just stay on track

562
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
and quality control checks for errors

563
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
and irregularities in the recording and

564
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
notifies the talent of what needs fixing

565
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
so

566
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
quality control should be an unbiased

567
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,400
ear

568
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,559
it should not be you you should not

569
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,200
check your own work have someone else do

570
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,400
it for you

571
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,640
if you are working remotely you might

572
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,039
consider doing a zoom session or a skype

573
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
session or a team session or just be

574
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
have someone on the phone

575
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,840
listening in with their own copy of you

576
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,520
know the book that you're trying to read

577
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
and follow along

578
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
does not take much

579
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
next up we have the production

580
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,039
environment so hardware software

581
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,039
underwear and just plain wear

582
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,880
noises come in different forms and i've

583
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
covered a lot of them you know fans if

584
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,200
you're recording in your kitchen it's a

585
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
refrigerator typically

586
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
if you're by a busy street you have

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
traffic if you're out you know near jfk

588
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
or laguardia or wherever you have air

589
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,679
traffic uh lawn mowers

590
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,200
and your neighbors because your

591
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,720
neighbors are never cooperating with you

592
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
ever right

593
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,919
but sound proofing is a way of abating

594
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,480
extraneous noises now

595
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
there are two kinds of noises it's kind

596
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
that the structural noise so if you know

597
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
the ground shakes you can't do much

598
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,600
about it the building carries all that

599
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,559
sound

600
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,960
if the air has noise to it you can abate

601
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,720
it and those of you familiar with radio

602
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
statler from here at hope will remember

603
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
that we had polystyrene walls

604
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,120
with some graffiti on it but we're

605
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
focusing on the polystyrene it acts as a

606
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,400
buffer

607
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
so you can have

608
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
basically styrofoam walls small enclosed

609
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
studio

610
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
um the other possibility is use drapes

611
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
use curtaining use

612
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
a heavy blanket

613
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
but don't

614
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
don't don't read in the bathroom

615
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
why do we say that okay so a lot of

616
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,159
people who thinks they sing great in the

617
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
bathroom

618
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
okay i've got a lot of honest people

619
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
here so

620
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
you think that the bathroom is a great

621
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,400
place to read

622
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,919
because you're enclosed you're

623
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,039
comfortable

624
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,960
you have that lovely tonality to it well

625
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
again that's the room noise that's the

626
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,880
reverberation and the echo of the tiles

627
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
don't do it

628
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,559
because you sound good to yourself

629
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
but a microphone does not forgive

630
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,039
the same way that the human being

631
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
basically discards most of its

632
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
information and focuses in on those

633
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
narrow things that really has to pay

634
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
attention to and remember

635
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,480
your ears do the same thing your eyes do

636
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,159
the same thing most of the information

637
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
that you pick up

638
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
you just immediately discard the brain

639
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
is a lossy

640
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
medium

641
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
microphones don't forgive

642
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
so don't do it in your bathroom also

643
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,799
somebody else might need the bathroom

644
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
you never know

645
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
so once you've gone from the production

646
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
phase we now go into post production

647
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
where you have editing and then you have

648
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
distribution

649
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
with editing basically you are dealing

650
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
with a 16-bit wave maybe a flak

651
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
you're dealing with

652
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
cd quality or dat quality audio

653
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,360
and you're going to perfect it and

654
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,199
you're going to keep it under 2 gigs

655
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
the reason for that is one if your

656
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
recording is longer than three hours

657
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
you're doing something wrong

658
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,679
and two you should always expect legacy

659
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,480
hardware in use in fact i make a mention

660
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
of neo's mantra later on

661
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
but expect embedded devices

662
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
expect a 32 plus or minus one

663
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,400
bit

664
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
limit

665
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
your workflow for this is going to

666
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
basically be make sure that you have all

667
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,400
the components of the audiobook before

668
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
you sit down to edit label all the

669
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
logical sections

670
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,799
look at the

671
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,279
table of contents i mean it's stupid but

672
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
you open up a book you see a table of

673
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,760
contents typically in pieces of fiction

674
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
it'll be

675
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,919
you just jump right into the first

676
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
chapter know what the hell you're

677
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
reading find out how many chapters you

678
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,679
have how many parts you have to it i

679
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,600
mean we got one book

680
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,400
where

681
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,480
the first chapter was numbered one the

682
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,279
last chapter was number 36 we got all

683
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,520
the audio down to the engineers booth at

684
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
where we were editing it and we

685
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
discovered that chapters 24 through 28

686
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,480
were missing

687
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
if you just check the first and the end

688
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,279
you think everything's great

689
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,080
so make sure you have all your materials

690
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
make sure you have preliminary header

691
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,039
and concluding materials now this is

692
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,400
your metadata

693
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,799
this is the part where you would say

694
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,440
name of the book by author

695
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
if you have a serial number you throw it

696
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
in there and you say

697
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
narrated by directed by engineered by

698
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
recorded on such and such a date

699
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,799
for the benefit of under the auspices of

700
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
that keeps a record of not only who

701
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
recorded it and who's responsible for it

702
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
but who took part and there are some

703
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,559
projects where you can contribute for

704
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,440
money

705
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,400
and you know make a decent living not a

706
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,440
great one but a decent one nothing to

707
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
laugh

708
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,679
at but ultimately you are finessing the

709
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,039
audio quality

710
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
last

711
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,919
for the last 75 years the focus of

712
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
talking books has been to convey the

713
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
information

714
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
not make it entertaining

715
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,440
not to make it an audio experience

716
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
all you want to know is how the hell do

717
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
you spell a word you have to be able to

718
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
navigate through a talking book to get

719
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,120
to it or i just want to know what the

720
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,279
epic of gilgamesh is i don't need

721
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
and gilgamesh did

722
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
who cares about that just read the story

723
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
so we get to the point first and then we

724
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
finish the audio

725
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
and one of the ways you can do that i'll

726
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
mention later on in the do's and don'ts

727
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,799
is

728
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,080
writing the silence

729
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
foreshadowing

730
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
sometimes you're gonna have to transmit

731
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
files from here to there now admittedly

732
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,400
ideally you would be all working in the

733
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
studio

734
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
all your equipment would be present all

735
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,159
your people would be present but

736
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,240
sometimes you have to work across the

737
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
globe

738
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,360
so how do you transmit big waves well

739
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
one thing is you can knock it down to

740
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,679
flak

741
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,360
flac is recommended under these

742
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
circumstances

743
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
another thing you can do is you can tar

744
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
xz your waves uh in both cases you save

745
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
about 25 of the file space and

746
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
sooner you can transfer files the closer

747
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,799
it is to being done

748
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
for the love of god

749
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,960
tarball your entire audacity project

750
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
we received a very difficult book a very

751
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
lengthy book

752
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,039
to edit

753
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
and it consisted of about 65 kilobytes

754
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
of the edit definition list from

755
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
audacity because they sent the aup not

756
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,279
the audio that came with it

757
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,000
if you're working in audacity and i know

758
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
version 3 has a you know save compressed

759
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,520
format and single file format

760
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,039
expect other people to still be using

761
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,600
2.4 for various reasons

762
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,919
tarball your entire folder before you

763
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,120
transmit it don't just send open file x

764
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,080
at this time and include file y

765
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
and do not under any circumstance send

766
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,960
mp3 to editors and the reason for this

767
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,679
is very simple once you lose quality you

768
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
cannot get it back

769
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
there's a saying we'll fix it in post

770
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,559
we'll fix it in post no post can't fix

771
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,919
things

772
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,159
if there's an omission a gap or a loss

773
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,880
of quality you can't fix it you cannot

774
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
recover it

775
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
because it was never made

776
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,279
or because it was outright destroyed

777
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
mp3 is very popular for a distribution

778
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,399
format

779
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,559
but it is no good for editors you're

780
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
working on

781
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,960
finessed

782
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,679
pristine master

783
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,559
versions of your project

784
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
and finally use 8.3 file names because

785
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,320
like i said

786
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,559
expect embedded devices from the year

787
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,320
dot to still be in use i mean you can

788
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,840
use an atari st to still cut audio

789
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,559
so

790
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,120
income's neo's mantra

791
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,080
never underestimate the ubiquity of and

792
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
reliance upon

793
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,200
irreplaceable and unupgradable well-past

794
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,720
end of life

795
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,600
equipment fulfilling mission critical

796
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,959
production roles

797
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,799
expect old to still be used

798
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,399
and some of that believe it or not is

799
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,399
dos-based

800
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
once you have finessed the audio you can

801
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
account for all of the recordings you

802
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,679
have all the metadata we are ready for

803
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,279
post-production distribution this is the

804
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
part where you take your master reels

805
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,159
and you give it to the public

806
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,799
or your patrons or your club or whatever

807
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,399
um national library service uses 3gp amr

808
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,799
wide band that's their codec of choice

809
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,559
for their talking book medium

810
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,520
librivox will send out mp3s as a final

811
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,279
product not as an editing product at 64

812
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
kilobits if you go to internet archive

813
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,440
sometimes you can get 128 kilobit

814
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
commercial proprietary formats go from

815
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,799
aac to m4b etc but basically it's drm

816
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,760
encoded audio so it may or may not apply

817
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
to you

818
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,880
but this is the far speaker

819
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,120
as to say the last we're familiar with

820
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
the notion of the last mile the last

821
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
mile of telecommunications the bit

822
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,720
between the home and the trunk line well

823
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
here is your last mile

824
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,399
you can get away with a lot of stuff

825
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,240
simply knowing what speakers you're

826
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,640
going to be playing against

827
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,679
this will give you 20 to 20 000 hertz

828
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,440
these speakers here might cover this a

829
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,200
little bit more of the range some people

830
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
might be listening with in-ear buds you

831
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
can knock down the codec based on what

832
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,440
your finished product is but you can

833
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
expect at least one person to have a

834
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,760
good audio quality system going on

835
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
so always provide

836
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,240
a higher quality than you expect the

837
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
device to be

838
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,240
excuse me

839
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,320
always produce a higher quality end

840
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
product than the device you expect to be

841
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,840
playing it on

842
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,320
so now we get to talk about the workflow

843
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
we've covered pre-production

844
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,600
post-production was the book worth it

845
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,799
how are we going to distribute it how

846
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
are we going to make our master reels

847
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
the first part in the any project is to

848
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
commit to the project

849
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,760
if you don't commit to the project

850
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
there's no work to be done

851
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you have to assemble your talent your

852
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,840
time and your money

853
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,240
yes money because even if you're doing

854
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,440
this on a volunteer basis time is money

855
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,679
it comes at a cost maybe you can't watch

856
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,320
the ball game or maybe you have to give

857
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
up your wednesday afternoons to listen

858
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,039
to somebody else's recording

859
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,480
and there should be a little bit of

860
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,799
compensation for all this work at the

861
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,080
very least something more than just

862
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,559
plain gratitude

863
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,159
but as you're dividing up the book into

864
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,840
logical chapters or sections to be

865
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,279
recorded

866
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,720
and let the table of contents guide you

867
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
divide up the work evenly and take

868
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,720
responsibility for each part especially

869
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,840
if you're working in a group setting

870
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
a production team which consists of a

871
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
narrator a monitor a reviewer typically

872
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,039
requires five and a half hours of staff

873
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,279
time to produce one hour of

874
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,480
error-free

875
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
product

876
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,159
this comes from the bill west document i

877
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,600
mentioned earlier

878
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,399
and a typical two-track original master

879
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,720
with just under three hours of inter of

880
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
listening time

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,559
requires not less than 16 and a half

882
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,279
hours of production time

883
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,200
so when you budget your time you're

884
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,519
being told to expect five and a half to

885
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
six and a half to one i would raise it

886
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,120
to ten to one

887
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
especially if you haven't done this

888
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
before

889
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,919
now you can record a section on its own

890
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,600
send it off to your quality control

891
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,840
person and have them report back as soon

892
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
as you finish recording

893
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
it does speed up the process and it's

894
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
easier for the person who's doing the

895
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
narration if they if they're told while

896
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,399
they have the content fresh in their

897
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,840
mind what they have to go back and fix

898
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,480
in a lot of places you will record

899
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,320
then review

900
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
the whole book

901
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,519
that can take weeks

902
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,559
do it while the iron is hot

903
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,880
so i recommend actually

904
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,720
either through github or some other file

905
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
sharing system or at least some

906
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,919
annotating system

907
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,399
convey what errors you find as soon as

908
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,240
you find them as soon as you possibly

909
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
can because the next recording session

910
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,919
someone might come in and say oh shoot i

911
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,440
have to fix five things well let's take

912
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,799
care of that before i get to you know

913
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,840
the rest of the work

914
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
once you've taken care of qc

915
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,679
and there are no fixes left

916
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,880
you might want to run through another

917
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
pair of ears just to listen to it

918
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
see if you can hear when

919
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,039
different recording sessions took place

920
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
at the beginning of a talk or at the

921
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,679
beginning of a lecture or beginning of

922
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,120
recording you come in with a whole bunch

923
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,039
of energy you're ready to read you are

924
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,679
ready to go and then after about an hour

925
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,640
you start to talk a little slower

926
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
and lose energy

927
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,600
so if you make a flub excuse me error

928
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
while you are talking slowly that's what

929
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,039
it's going to sound like it's going to

930
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,279
sound disjointed

931
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,640
when you make a mistake you don't want

932
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
to call attention to the mistake you

933
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,919
made you know if you say for example in

934
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,320
the beginning dog made heaven and earth

935
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,440
and you go back and you have to fix it

936
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
you say in the beginning god made the

937
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
heaven and earth

938
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,679
your end your listener is going to say

939
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
why is he emphasizing that word he must

940
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,079
have screwed up

941
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,199
so you want to be aware of your

942
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,319
continuity also

943
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
in studio recordings and that's sort of

944
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,800
the on-site system that we have

945
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,399
the narrator and the director work as a

946
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,800
team they really do the engineer and the

947
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,839
director

948
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,639
are

949
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,000
immediately

950
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,560
able to provide quality assurance now

951
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
quality assurance is the prevention of

952
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
problems quality control

953
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,960
is detecting problems

954
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,719
when an engineer and director work

955
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,839
together

956
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,679
they're able to prevent problems from

957
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,639
recurring they address it on the spot

958
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,918
this means you don't have to go back and

959
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,000
re-record

960
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,918
the director and quality control

961
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,399
cooperate with each other

962
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
quality control will say this has to be

963
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
re-read or i heard a sneeze here or the

964
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,599
guy

965
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,520
lip slacks in the middle of you know

966
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,800
page five

967
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
and you can deal with it

968
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,960
as soon as the narrator comes back

969
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
and the errors are caught in a timely

970
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,400
manner you don't have to wait weeks for

971
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,440
it

972
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,680
generally speaking

973
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,240
about 80 percent of the books to 90

974
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,480
percent of the books that we record in

975
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
studio as a group on premises

976
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
continue on to post-production

977
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,440
it's a very high success rate

978
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,599
road sessions on the other hand are a

979
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,480
little different about 80 of the books

980
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
fail to make it out of production and

981
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
here are the reasons why

982
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
if you're doing this solo there's no

983
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,240
director to sustain quality assurance

984
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
you have to rely on your own bias to

985
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
decide if you've done the right job

986
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,599
there's no engineer to maintain

987
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,000
technological assets in other words you

988
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,599
really can't keep an eye on whether the

989
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,240
computer is in good shape or not

990
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,680
there's no quality control because the

991
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,839
deadline is more

992
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,119
important sometimes you're on a deadline

993
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,160
and you're on a schedule and you have to

994
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,119
make the schedule and you have to

995
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,800
sacrifice and that sacrifice happens to

996
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,560
be the quality control so occasionally

997
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,119
you hear a book with a burp in it

998
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,880
it happens

999
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,560
lack of communication if you've got

1000
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,599
people who are supposed to be taking

1001
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,359
their part they don't respond back

1002
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,520
we suddenly don't trust these people

1003
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,880
life happens

1004
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,079
you know

1005
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,079
people lose interest

1006
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,920
and if they lose interest they drop out

1007
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,200
of the project

1008
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,800
so to

1009
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
quote someone who i remember way back

1010
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,400
and you know back when the year started

1011
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
with 1980

1012
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
don't allow the task ahead of you to be

1013
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,599
greater than the enthusiasm behind you

1014
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,800
like i don't want to scare anyone from

1015
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
this project but if you're going to

1016
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
commit to this

1017
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,440
commit to it enthusiastically knowing

1018
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,520
what you are dealing with

1019
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,280
recording at home has a very high

1020
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,560
failure rate

1021
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,839
uh some of the books that i've heard

1022
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,680
from librivox would never have passed

1023
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,720
quality control for an nls standing in

1024
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,480
fact some of the books from audible that

1025
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,680
i've heard even though i'm not

1026
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,760
technically a client

1027
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,599
they would not pass for the highest

1028
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
standards for example you need 48

1029
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,520
decibels of signal-to-noise ratio

1030
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,880
minimum

1031
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
minimum

1032
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
if i were to take an audio recording

1033
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
sample right now of this room

1034
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,720
you would see a small flat line you

1035
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
would think that the air is clear

1036
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,560
but when you actually measure the number

1037
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
of decibels

1038
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,839
no this sounds a bit more like 42

1039
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,599
sorry about that i don't know why i'm

1040
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,160
going ding

1041
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,079
but participants will drop out of the

1042
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,839
project you know if they don't have a

1043
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,119
success rate

1044
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,800
people will be turned down

1045
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,920
and also you need qualitative voices

1046
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
now there is one caveat to all of this

1047
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,400
which is that books narrated from home

1048
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,960
using home studios tend to pass the

1049
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
rudimentary quality control requirements

1050
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
but tend to require greater

1051
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,920
post-production that is to say if you

1052
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,839
have a home studio odds are you know

1053
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,760
what you're doing to begin with

1054
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,720
so

1055
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
go on

1056
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,480
but because there's no one there with an

1057
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,320
unbiased ear

1058
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,760
you may have to do more fixes later on

1059
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,240
therefore

1060
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,800
i don't want to say don't do it but do

1061
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,520
it

1062
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,359
if you have talent you want to share it

1063
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,839
do so

1064
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,920
but i can't tell you how many times i've

1065
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,160
heard this in the middle of a book from

1066
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,079
liberty box where i can tell that the

1067
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,680
narrator has a home studio

1068
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,440
it'll just piss off your engineers so

1069
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,119
post-production takes a lot longer while

1070
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,079
you try to remove those defects rather

1071
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,000
than focusing on the content

1072
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
and for those who are recording from

1073
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
home by the way

1074
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,400
your success rate is pretty much 60

1075
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
i mean it's not bad it just dies in

1076
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,880
post-production

1077
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
so the final

1078
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
slide

1079
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,720
is the do's and don'ts and there are

1080
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,640
quite a few here

1081
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,040
so i want to start off with what a

1082
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,880
workflow would sound like if you were

1083
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,960
doing this at home for your first time

1084
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
maybe you're working in a team let's uh

1085
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,160
just name a book that you happen to

1086
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
think of off the top of your head

1087
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,480
anyone

1088
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,079
okay no participation fine

1089
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,920
whatever book you you have you're going

1090
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,359
to sit down you're going to record

1091
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,480
you've got your microphone in front of

1092
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,599
you you want to make sure that the

1093
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,839
microphone is exactly where your voice

1094
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
is you'll notice that if i talk down

1095
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,680
here with the microphone above me you're

1096
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
not hearing anything if i talk up here

1097
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,000
you're hearing my voice very well why

1098
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
because i happen to know my speech is

1099
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,359
here it's concentrated in front of my

1100
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,920
teeth a little bit below the jaw

1101
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
not off to the side

1102
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
not off at an angle

1103
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
so i will know where my axis is

1104
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,599
if i want to read this screen for

1105
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,880
example

1106
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
i would position the microphone where my

1107
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,960
voice is going to go

1108
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,200
where i can see the monitor

1109
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,880
and read

1110
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,839
not off to the side

1111
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,040
and project my voice downwards

1112
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,640
a lot of streamers

1113
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
they work like this

1114
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,599
why do they work like this

1115
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,079
you are attacked and you know why

1116
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,920
because you are using a cardioid

1117
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,040
microphone where you expect people to

1118
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
talk upwards the focus is not on reading

1119
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
the screen the focus is on looking at

1120
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,920
others

1121
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
it's at looking at the camera at the

1122
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,480
zoom

1123
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,920
and who cares if there's a microphone in

1124
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,680
your way you're looking at a mario

1125
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
you're showing off right damn i look

1126
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,960
good

1127
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
realistically

1128
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
you want the microphone beneath you

1129
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,800
you're not going to be screaming and or

1130
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
rating into the microphone

1131
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,240
you're just going to be reading off a

1132
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,480
screen do's and don'ts

1133
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,800
this section is focused on narration

1134
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
tips for directors engineers

1135
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
post-production markup and collaboration

1136
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,359
will be found at

1137
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,839
and you just read

1138
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,760
when i do my sections

1139
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,720
at home or if i'm on the road or if i'm

1140
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,440
giving you know new talent advice

1141
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
i usually say start your recording

1142
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,560
thusly

1143
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,319
name the book

1144
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,839
who's the author

1145
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,839
who's reading who's directing

1146
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,680
put in the day and time that you began

1147
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,520
your recording

1148
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,440
very important because it'll help you

1149
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
keep a log

1150
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,720
it'll tell you how much time and effort

1151
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
you've put into work

1152
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,680
and then shut the hell up for 10 seconds

1153
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,359
why would you do that the answer is you

1154
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,760
want the microphone to actually pick up

1155
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,599
all the background noise

1156
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,760
as an engineer we've worked with a lot

1157
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,200
of books that have recorded back in the

1158
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,200
1980s 1970s 1990s all sorts of

1159
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,960
background noises

1160
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,440
if you have a good sample of the noise

1161
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,599
floor and the room tone where you are

1162
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,040
recording

1163
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,560
audacity has this nice little feature

1164
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
called noise reduction

1165
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,599
we love it

1166
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,920
but in order to work properly you have

1167
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,040
to give it a sample of noise

1168
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,200
don't make me extract it from snippets

1169
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
of audio

1170
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,599
give me the sample at the beginning

1171
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,319
so

1172
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,760
you do your intro

1173
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,119
you walk away from the mic for a few

1174
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,319
seconds and then you begin recording

1175
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
so that's a top-notch pet peeve

1176
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
as you can tell

1177
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
another one

1178
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,160
ride

1179
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,839
the pause

1180
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,520
if you have a book and you're going to

1181
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
have paragraphs and sentences read the

1182
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,359
freaking punctuation i mean you're not

1183
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,359
christopher walken even christopher

1184
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,920
walken will respect the notion of a

1185
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,400
sentence is a logical unit of

1186
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,800
information

1187
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,359
if you have a list a b

1188
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,599
c and d

1189
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,359
write the commas

1190
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,359
why would you do that well for one thing

1191
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,760
it makes it a lot easier to pick up in

1192
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,480
case you make a mistake

1193
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,680
if i say you know lettuce tomato onions

1194
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
underwear

1195
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,760
i can easily cut after tomatoes and

1196
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,440
replace underwear with cheese

1197
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,880
if you have less tomato onions and

1198
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,040
underwear cheese

1199
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
i don't have enough gap as an editor to

1200
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
separate the cheese from the underwear

1201
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
ride the pause you can always tighten up

1202
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,480
a pause you can't stretch the two apart

1203
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,599
without sounding processed

1204
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
speaking of sounding processed

1205
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,359
compression a lot of people use

1206
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
compression they try to rise the levels

1207
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,040
make it sound a more full sound of audio

1208
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,920
guys this is not music if you adjust the

1209
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,000
human voice

1210
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,119
it's going to be audible it's going to

1211
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,560
be noticeable it's going to become the

1212
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,480
uncanny valley of your eardrums

1213
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,240
so it'll sound a little more like

1214
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
auto-tune and auto-tune i know i know

1215
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,640
it's 20 22. i know we have really good

1216
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,480
deep fakes with audio

1217
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,680
but if

1218
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,200
no it's not going to sound right it's

1219
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,040
going to sound absolutely wrong

1220
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
it actually

1221
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,160
is horrific

1222
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,160
so do not do not use compression try to

1223
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,240
prevent needing compression in the first

1224
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
place by getting your levels high you

1225
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,160
want to keep it between

1226
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,480
negative six

1227
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,440
to let's say negative 12 decibels

1228
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,880
it's kind of hard to watch because you

1229
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
need a view meter and you're trying to

1230
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,280
focus on reading

1231
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,839
speaking of reading

1232
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,680
please

1233
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,280
please

1234
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,760
read the damn book before you record

1235
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,119
please

1236
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,040
i beg you

1237
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,960
because if you don't read the book ahead

1238
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
of time and you're reading cold you it

1239
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,040
will show it will sound you it'll be a

1240
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,200
mechanical reading

1241
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,960
be familiar not just familiar be

1242
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,520
authoritative in what you read

1243
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,560
people are relying on you and you and

1244
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,160
you and you and you and you and you and

1245
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,200
you

1246
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
to present the book like a finished

1247
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
product not like i'm just learning this

1248
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,839
for the first time excuse me

1249
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,960
just read the book and then read it to

1250
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,680
yourself aloud

1251
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,960
you need to know what words you're going

1252
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,280
to trip over what pronunciation guides

1253
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,880
you have

1254
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,200
if you don't know if you are so naive

1255
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,720
that you think it's written it's

1256
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,880
pronounced nave

1257
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,200
don't read the book

1258
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,680
because if you pronounce naive as nave

1259
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,960
all throughout guess what there is no

1260
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,880
such thing as find and replace in audio

1261
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,319
and not only that sometimes you're gonna

1262
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,200
say nave nave

1263
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,119
nerve and you're gonna replace it with

1264
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,520
naive

1265
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,160
gee jim was sounding very naive they're

1266
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,640
all throughout

1267
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,280
don't make your edits noticeable

1268
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,720
if you screw up a sentence and you have

1269
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
to go back to re-record it don't just

1270
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,560
record the word you screwed up

1271
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,520
or the sentence record a sentence before

1272
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,839
record a sentence after

1273
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,839
try to make it dovetail with the

1274
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,040
correction

1275
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,520
this is audio engineering 101

1276
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,000
and it's very easy to do and if you ride

1277
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,960
the pauses between sentences

1278
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,760
you don't need to find where those words

1279
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,960
are

1280
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
so for example if i have a piece of

1281
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
audio unfortunately i do not have an

1282
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,240
example on me but if you follow up on

1283
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,560
github later on uh probably next week

1284
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
i'll give you a prime example

1285
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,200
where the audio goes on for 24 hours

1286
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,359
because some books go on for 24 or even

1287
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,760
36 hours straight

1288
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,839
i have to as an engineer without a copy

1289
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,359
of my book

1290
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,040
find where the corrections have to be

1291
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,560
made

1292
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,960
if you give a five second pause between

1293
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,000
chapters

1294
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,440
you have just made my life so much

1295
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
easier because all i have to do is look

1296
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
for the big gaps

1297
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,280
one two three four five that's gotta be

1298
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,359
chapter five chapter five

1299
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,200
now i can narrow down my search for what

1300
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,440
needs to be corrected

1301
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,079
when you go from paragraph to paragraph

1302
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,920
take a breath

1303
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,839
you don't have to read a sentence in a

1304
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,880
single lungful

1305
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
you have the ability i mean we're not

1306
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,760
doing this live

1307
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
what we are doing instead

1308
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,480
is committing to tape or in the case of

1309
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,839
the 21st century committing to computers

1310
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,599
you have so much storage capacity

1311
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,599
use it to your benefit

1312
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,240
take it slow

1313
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,839
that will speed up the recording the

1314
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,160
post-production the corrections

1315
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,640
your levels will be good

1316
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,000
ultimately you will be published

1317
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,599
but you have to keep your standards high

1318
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
at all times you have to make the

1319
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,440
investment in the equipment

1320
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,480
the time

1321
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,079
the effort

1322
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,640
the ability to take criticism

1323
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,960
like if somebody's very nasal you got to

1324
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,559
go back and say you have to re-record

1325
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,559
this chapter you had a booger up your

1326
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,800
nose the whole time

1327
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
and take that criticism

1328
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
realistically

1329
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,480
there are some people who will read

1330
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,559
sentences mechanically

1331
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,640
they have a distinct pattern to the way

1332
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,079
that they speak

1333
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,079
you are hearing an example of it right

1334
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,200
now

1335
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,319
this is a major turn off

1336
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,680
you need to sound

1337
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,599
as normal

1338
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,040
conversational

1339
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,280
as you could possibly be

1340
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,559
there are a few times when you have to

1341
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,079
exaggerate i mean if you see an

1342
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,200
exclamation point you have to exclaim

1343
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
if there's a question mark

1344
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,240
can you ask the question

1345
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,160
and especially finally

1346
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,760
because this is one this is a big

1347
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,440
problem

1348
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,640
there are a lot of books that are read

1349
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
mechanically by computers now like i

1350
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,160
said this is 2022 deep fakes exist

1351
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,920
there are great ways of fussing with

1352
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,599
audio to make things sound like what

1353
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,119
someone said even though they didn't set

1354
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,240
it because it's a computer-generated

1355
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,839
thing but for the love of

1356
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,040
no

1357
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,440
if i give who here watches pbs i'm

1358
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,800
familiar with the phrase viewers like

1359
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,240
you

1360
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,720
okay okay a cold reading of viewers like

1361
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
you

1362
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,480
where's the emphasis

1363
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,119
if i say viewers like you

1364
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,119
great

1365
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,440
if viewers like you

1366
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
great

1367
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,599
viewers like you

1368
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,520
these are three different readings of

1369
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
the exact same phrase

1370
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,400
if i say

1371
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,920
i love you i love you

1372
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,400
i love you

1373
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,000
three different readings of the exact

1374
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,319
same thing computers are at

1375
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,960
figuring out what the emphasis should be

1376
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,640
but for humans it's normal especially in

1377
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,160
english we emphasize the word that needs

1378
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,400
to be dressed to be brought to our

1379
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
attention

1380
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,520
emphasis

1381
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,720
something that's not really good for

1382
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,760
computers so please if i ever hear that

1383
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,400
you ran any piece of text through

1384
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,319
text-to-speech especially that tick-tock

1385
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,640
voice i'mma kill you

1386
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,000
i'm gonna kill you i'm gonna beat you

1387
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,440
over the head i'm gonna take away your

1388
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,760
microphone but most of all

1389
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,119
we're not there yet

1390
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,440
ai is not that good yet and it's going

1391
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
to take more years for that

1392
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,920
so for the human nuance and also for the

1393
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
familiarity

1394
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,319
we still need human voices

1395
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,240
and i'd like you to join in this quest

1396
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,640
to become the next set of voices

1397
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,319
you know what you got to do you know

1398
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,319
what you shouldn't do

1399
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,720
thank you for being here and i hope you

1400
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,079
enjoy

1401
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,920
trying to become the next set of voices

1402
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,240
reading to someone because it really

1403
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,079
does change lives

1404
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,000
you are being again a gap filler we have

1405
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,760
a great degree of illiteracy in this

1406
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,760
world still i mean it is 21st century

1407
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
but illiteracy is an issue

1408
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,960
when you become a book for someone

1409
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,319
suddenly it doesn't matter if they're

1410
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,680
illiterate

1411
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,079
they're reading by their ears

1412
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,800
and you will be writing for the ear

1413
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,980
thank you

1414
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,000
[Applause]

1415
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,240
and i see we've made it exactly on time

1416
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,680
so

1417
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,440
if you have any questions come over here

1418
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,400
to this microphone

1419
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,319
wow

1420
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,839
i think i did

1421
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,440
i don't think i have that much court

1422
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,880
well there's not a lot of questions but

1423
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,280
let's find out

1424
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
now that we've offered the opportunity

1425
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,319
right

1426
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,960
i am an audible

1427
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,400
uh

1428
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
well you want to call me subscriber i've

1429
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
got hundreds

1430
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,920
one of the things that i've noticed that

1431
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,960
uh i used to just pull off books but

1432
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,920
then i found read by author

1433
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,599
and oh my god does that make a

1434
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,079
difference i happen to prefer works that

1435
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,640
are read by the author um this is why i

1436
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,240
make a great

1437
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,880
enjoyment actually of borges uh while he

1438
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
was in the united states for a fairly

1439
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,920
brief period he did give lectures uh

1440
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,760
with the smithsonian and library of

1441
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,359
congress he read some of his own works a

1442
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,520
lot of his recitals i've committed to

1443
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,800
heart better

1444
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,640
through the year than through reading by

1445
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,520
eye

1446
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,119
one of the things that i liked was i

1447
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,599
noticed that the author would emphasize

1448
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,040
a phrase or a situation different than a

1449
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,480
cold reading

1450
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,880
not only a good reading but even in

1451
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,280
translation for example the uh short

1452
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,760
story burgess and i which is a sort of

1453
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,520
an autobiographical

1454
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,280
joke or jest

1455
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,200
the english translation is a fairly good

1456
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,280
read i believe it's available from simon

1457
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,240
schuster

1458
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,599
but then when you hear it in the

1459
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,760
original spanish or actually i think he

1460
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,280
wrote it in english originally i'm not

1461
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,240
sure

1462
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,079
but uh this is the problem with murkeys

1463
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,920
he spoke too many languages and just

1464
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,160
wrote prolifically but when his own

1465
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,599
reading

1466
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,760
he emphasized i'm going to try to get

1467
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,359
this right i'll have an example up on

1468
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,240
the github pages

1469
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,720
he ends

1470
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,520
so i do not know which one of the two

1471
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,280
of the two borges

1472
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,200
writes this page

1473
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,440
sort of a matter of fact

1474
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,880
the translation that came from simon

1475
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
schuster was

1476
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,040
i'm not sure which one of the two reads

1477
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,040
this page

1478
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,760
those are very different readings

1479
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,079
you're not there to inflect for the

1480
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,400
author you're there to

1481
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,359
convey what the author has already said

1482
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,640
the other issue is there's a lot of

1483
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,280
music thrown in for i don't know why i

1484
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,480
think it's just for decor

1485
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,240
challenges questions comments fetches

1486
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,440
coffee

1487
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,599
uh you were talking about including

1488
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,319
metadata at the start of your recordings

1489
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,240
before that 10 second gap

1490
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,280
uh

1491
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,079
one thing i wanted to add to that

1492
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,280
because this is something that i

1493
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,680
experienced in the last few months

1494
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,400
as you do more of this you're going to

1495
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,160
struggle to like

1496
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,599
the sound of the recordings that you

1497
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,760
make and eventually

1498
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,920
if you own a lot of equipment and

1499
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,000
experiment with different microphones

1500
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
you might accidentally create one that

1501
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,400
you really like the sound of

1502
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,280
and

1503
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,359
there's nothing worse than going back

1504
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,920
over your work and discovering that and

1505
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,680
realizing that you have no information

1506
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
about how you did that

1507
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,920
so when you are including

1508
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,200
that metadata at the start of your

1509
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,960
recordings you might also want to

1510
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,040
include things like where you positioned

1511
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,240
the microphone

1512
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,400
which microphone you were using what

1513
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,480
your general analog equipment settings

1514
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,280
were

1515
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,640
because that would have saved me a lot

1516
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
of time personally

1517
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,040
absolutely when you start a project keep

1518
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,200
your hardware and your software and your

1519
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,720
positioning consistent this is

1520
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,680
environmental factors obviously

1521
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,040
the other thing that

1522
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,559
is worth mentioning is when you finish a

1523
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,400
recording don't just you know hit cut

1524
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,799
and you're done um

1525
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,799
take five seconds

1526
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,640
and just say i'm finishing at such and

1527
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,720
such a time on such and such a page

1528
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,799
it makes it easier to start the next

1529
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,880
section as you go along

1530
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,359
uh also one thing that i think i forgot

1531
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,880
to mention but record natural don't use

1532
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,000
eq as your recording that you can do a

1533
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
little more finesse in post-production

1534
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,000
than you can live and you can keep it

1535
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,839
consistent all throughout your work so

1536
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,440
anybody i don't know if anybody listens

1537
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,599
to the brian lehrer show because on wnbc

1538
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,200
he's got that nice deep voice but then

1539
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,559
you hear him on television he's got this

1540
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,559
little teeny voice up here

1541
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,920
that's because the eq is being ridden

1542
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,520
record flat record natural

1543
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,680
you know i noticed that you recommended

1544
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,319
flac as uh the

1545
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,400
file sharing kind of audio

1546
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,359
format

1547
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,280
why not wave

1548
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,720
wave is a very large file format

1549
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,440
so i mean just to start with one cd is

1550
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,960
650 megs that should get you about

1551
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,640
what was it

1552
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,119
i think it was about i'm sorry

1553
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,040
let me start from another direction

1554
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,440
uh let's talk about the 2gig file limit

1555
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,119
because some dos programs are still in

1556
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,760
use that do audio adjustments that

1557
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,160
should get you about six hours of audio

1558
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,559
that six hour of audio at two gigs would

1559
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,839
flow down to about a gig and a quarter

1560
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:23,440
as a flak and also flack is lossless

1561
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,480
you're not losing quality along the way

1562
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,119
so you're shaving off about 750 megs of

1563
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,839
transmission on a two on a two gig file

1564
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,680
and also the other thing is flac is now

1565
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,079
pretty much well supported by everybody

1566
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,799
ogg is not as well supported

1567
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:39,760
so

1568
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,720
flat can be recommended at that point

1569
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,680
but

1570
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,680
basically i i tested against tarx

1571
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,480
zipping wave files and flack and they're

1572
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,680
about about the same

1573
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,839
oh now i'm in trouble

1574
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,720
by the way

1575
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,240
so uh i think you kind of

1576
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
very briefly touched on this but my word

1577
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,280
background is not really an

1578
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,720
accessibility thing unfortunately to

1579
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,760
some degree is that like as a someone

1580
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,480
who was a big star wars fan uh for a

1581
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,319
while with a lot of their book series

1582
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,400
starting with the original audiobooks

1583
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,160
because it's based on a movie series

1584
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,359
they often instead of just um relaying

1585
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,440
or just excitingly read the information

1586
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,280
they would do as you say make it an

1587
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,839
audio experience uh where they would add

1588
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:34,559
in

1589
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,640
the movies reuse the movie soundtracks

1590
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,160
put in sound effects from them that's no

1591
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,400
longer an audiobook that used to be

1592
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,680
the thing that was kind of unique to

1593
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,920
star wars and some sci-fi but now

1594
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
there's just pure audio projects where

1595
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,599
basically they're bringing back radio

1596
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,000
serials instead of trying to like put

1597
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,839
out information i just wanted to know if

1598
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,359
you want to elaborate like that sort of

1599
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,119
proliferation do you see that as like

1600
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,880
muddying the waters of the type of work

1601
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,160
you're trying to do or is it something

1602
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,079
where it's become i'll put it i'll put

1603
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,000
in another parallel uh it's like saying

1604
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,280
the difference between watchmen the

1605
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,359
movie and watchmen the audio the graphic

1606
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:09,599
novel um whenever you transmute one

1607
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,119
medium into another there's a certain

1608
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,200
adaptation that has to take place

1609
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,079
um what the star wars series is doing is

1610
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,760
being entertainment or a continuation of

1611
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,280
the entertainment as if it were a radio

1612
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,640
play if you were reading a book

1613
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,720
then it is superfluous and you're

1614
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,119
distracting from the message

1615
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,880
uh there is one last thing i am going to

1616
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,160
add to this because i don't think i

1617
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,400
covered this quite uh in my slide deck

1618
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,520
but i want to talk about foreign

1619
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,359
language um excuse me foreign language

1620
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,960
because this is the united states half

1621
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,000
of all homes speak another language

1622
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,599
there is a big difference between a

1623
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,119
native speaker

1624
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,000
and a native reader

1625
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,079
you can be very you can be proficient in

1626
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,640
a language and still flub it and if you

1627
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,160
don't believe me how many of you were

1628
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,400
here for hurricane sandy

1629
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,839
and how many people remember michael

1630
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:02,880
bloomberg's god-awful atrocious spanish

1631
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,400
that's the difference

1632
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,680
that's sort of the difference i'm going

1633
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,319
at you can be very proficient but sound

1634
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,440
horrific

1635
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,280
if you have an accent it may become a

1636
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,400
problem

1637
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
and then finally because i see the time

1638
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,359
is going

1639
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,319
um

1640
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,960
native speakers don't necessarily

1641
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,000
be they don't necessarily become native

1642
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,040
readers

1643
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,680
you need fluency so if you're not fluent

1644
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,599
in a language and can't read on a fluent

1645
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,799
level

1646
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,799
let someone else do it you can help on

1647
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,400
the editing qc

1648
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,920
just don't narrate yourself

1649
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,119
all right i think we are out of time at

1650
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,960
this point we are out of time so thank

1651
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,799
you very much i know corey doctro is

1652
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,040
still probably spieling as we speak

1653
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,880
and for you to come here i really

1654
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,300
appreciate it so thank you all

1655
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:52,380
[Applause]

1656
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,119
it'll be just a few minutes to set up

1657
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,839
for this next time
