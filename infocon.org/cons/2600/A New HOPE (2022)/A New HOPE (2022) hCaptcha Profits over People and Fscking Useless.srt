00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,400
over people is the captcha dead by

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
steven presser so before we begin the

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
talk just a couple of pieces of business

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
please make sure your phone is on you

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
while you're in session it's important

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
not to interrupt the speakers

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
be sure to stay hydrated throughout the

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,799
show it's very important we don't have

12
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
any medical emergencies because you

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,600
didn't have enough to drink enough water

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,880
to drink

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
hope policy is that please keep your

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
mass on when you're inside the building

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
if you need to take it off for a while

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
just step outside you can take it off

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
anywhere outside the building but we

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
just like to try and keep everyone

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
stephen is remote he can't hear you and

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
he can't see you so when we get the qa

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,160
session we're going to turn the mic

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
around and you just come up and ask

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
questions directly to the mic so he can

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
hear you and interact with you we'll

59
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
also be taking questions through the

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
chat room for the chat and the

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
for this talk

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,640

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
indefinitely it's dedicated to this talk

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
so with that over to stephen

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
right thank you um so

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,800
before we get started slides with image

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,080
descriptions and notes are online at

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,840
pressers.name slash a new hope that's p

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,920
r e s s e r s dot n a m e slash a new

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,879
hope

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,480
other than the dot and the slash there

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
is nothing in there but letters

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
uh all right so

74
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
would you believe me if i told you that

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,560
15 of the internet is behind or was

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
behind a capture that couldn't tell a

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
bot from a human

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
and what on earth does accessibility

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
have to do with security

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
the rest of this talk should start to

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
answer those questions

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
however before i get started and before

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
we really start to dig in i've got to

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
make a title change

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
i've presented part of this work the

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
part only product called age capture

87
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,440
before

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
recently a high level technical manager

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
from age capture reached out to me and

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
wanted to talk i spoke with that person

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
on monday and honestly it changed some

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
of my views on the company and on the

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,959
product

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,319
can't stand behind that old title

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
anymore so i'm changing the title of

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
this talk to is the caption dead

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
like all rhetorical questions as titles

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
the answer is no

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
but i really want to convince you that

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
the answer is no not yet

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
but it's going that way

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
so

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
i think that

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,720
and i apologize for some of the

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,080
roughness around revisions that i've

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
been doing last week

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
after talking with hcapsha i really do

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
believe that they're trying to strike

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
the best balance they can between a lot

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,880
of complex requirements in a complex

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
environment

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
i can't stand behind broken because i

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
don't believe i'm in a place to evaluate

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,560
that anymore at least not completely

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
but i do still want to tell you about

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
some of the work i did with the security

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,880
of aged captcha in the last year

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
so here's our roadmap i'm going to start

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
with some background mostly i'm

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
assistive technology and on captures

121
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,840
then i'm going to talk about the work i

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
did on age capture itself

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
and i'm going to finish with a look at

124
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
the future both of age captcha and of

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
caches as a whole

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
so let's jump into assistive technology

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
disability and assistive technology are

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
going to play a large part here so for

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,039
those of you who aren't already familiar

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,039
with assistive technology let's begin by

131
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
looking at some

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,000
the use of assistive technologies is

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
actually really common many of us are

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
already using assistive technology right

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
now your eyeglasses or contact lenses

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
however as useful as these things are

137
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
they don't really have a bearing on how

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
we interact with a computer

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
so i want to focus on some assistive

140
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
technology that does some input and

141
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
output devices

142
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
let's start with this

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
this is a refreshable braille display

144
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,199
with a perkins style brailler keyboard

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
it's a big mouthful of a name

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
this could be used by someone who is

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
blind or visually impaired instead of or

148
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
in addition to a keyboard and monitor

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
so the paddles at the top are part of

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
the braille input keyboard while the

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
white dots in the middle are there for

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
reading text

153
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
another example is a foot operated

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
keyboard and mouse could be used by

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
anyone who has limited or no ability to

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,759
use their hands to type somebody who has

157
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
really severe corporal tunnel someone

158
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,240
who's lost a hand for whatever reason or

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
just doesn't have fine motor skills with

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,800
their hands

161
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
and next up there's something called a

162
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
puff and sip device

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
which is used by typically someone who's

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,919
quadriplegic and has no fine motor

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,039
control

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
it can also be used to replace a

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,759
keyboard and mouse

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
and the last piece of assistive

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,039
technology i want to talk about is

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
called a screen reader

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
screen readers are software used by

172
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,240
people who are print disabled which

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
typically is blind visually impaired

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,120
security dyslexic or any of a number of

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,639
other things

176
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
it outputs on-screen text as speech as

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,039
audio and allows users to navigate with

178
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,800
just the keyboard if they should choose

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,479
to do so

180
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,720
um before we go any further i want to

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
show you just how different using

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
assistive technology can be so what i'm

183
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
about to play for you is a recording of

184

someone using screen reader i'm first

185

going to play it without the video and

alright so before i play that with the

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,000
video i want you to think to yourself if

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
i were using a computer that way would i

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
know what the user was actually what the

201

interaction with the computer actually

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
was

203
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960

216
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
all right so think to yourself

is that what i thought was going on

218
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
so i also want to emphasize that what

219
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,799
i've shown is really only a very small

220
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
selection of the assistive technology

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
available and that there are many more

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
options

223
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
each of the alternative methods has its

224
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
own various advantages and disadvantages

225
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
for example a screen reader is really

226
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
hard to use to skim text

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,640
but typing input is really fast

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
in contrast a puff and sip may allow

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,399
someone to skim quickly but might be

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
very slow to type

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
assistive technology is really tuned to

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
the person its attempt it is assisting

233
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
and to that person's abilities

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
so it's as variable as disability itself

235
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
which really is to say very extremely

236
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
two people with the same capabilities

237
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
may use entirely different assistive

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
technology because that's just what

239
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
works for them

240
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
all right

241
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,680
so

242
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
let's

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
continue background with captchas

244
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
caches are small puzzles that are simple

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
for humans to solve and hard for

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
computers this is often called ai hard

247
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
human easy

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
they're used to ensure that

249
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
often they're used to ensure that a

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
request for something comes from a human

251
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,120
and not any kind of automation robot

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
you'll bear with me for a little bit of

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
history captcha the term captcha is a

254
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
backing for completely automated public

255
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
turing tests to tell computers and

256
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
humans apart

257
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
the name is from a paper called captcha

258
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,839
using ai hard problems for security

259
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,399
which was published in 2003.

260
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
that paper led directly to recaptcha the

261
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
first version of what you see here

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
there were other things that were caches

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,839
first just they didn't have that name

264
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
recaptcha was one of the first if not

265
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,839
the first to actually make captures do

266
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,120
useful work

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
it got humans to label hard to read

268
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,240
portions of text in order to train

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,959
optical character recognition systems

270
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,880
so what was particularly brilliant about

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
recaptcha was how it aligned to diverse

272
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
problems

273
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
in this case websites and users wanted

274
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
to eliminate automation

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
and the authors of ocr software needed

276
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,279
better data recaptcha took these two

277
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
groups put them together so they could

278
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
solve each other's problems in a

279
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
mutually beneficial way

280
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,760
recaptcha was bought by google who

281
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
wanted better ocr eventually however

282
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
machine ocr got to be as good or better

283
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
than human making it no longer an ai

284
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,880
card problem

285
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
so next google looked around for another

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
ai heart problem and seems to have

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
settled on object identification street

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
photography

289
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
possibly for their self-driving cars

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
and then the revised recaptcha once

291
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
again into this now familiar i'm not a

292
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,000
robot checkbox this tracks the user's

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
behavior on the page it applies machine

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
learning and it uses that to make a very

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
good guess about whether the user is

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,079
human or automation

297
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
users only has to solve a puzzle if they

298
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,000
look like automation otherwise you check

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
the box and you move on with your life

300
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
no need to solve a puzzle

301
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
so recaptcha isn't the only captcha out

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
there but it is probably one of the best

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
known and it has tended to be at the

304
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
cutting edge of caches

305
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
so with a little bit of history and a

306
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
little bit of background that captures

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
let's talk about h-captcha

308
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
h-captcha is a commercial product put

309
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
out by a company called intuition

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
machines incorporated or imi

311
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
and it's used to prevent

312
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,160
automation on about 15 of the internet

313
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
according to the latest numbers that i

314
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
could find

315
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,279
as far as i can tell mostly that is

316
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,320
through their largest customer

317
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
cloudflare who picked them up around

318
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
april 2020 which is actually how i heard

319
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
about them

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
intuition machines is a blockchain based

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
data labeling and ai service company

322
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
so if you're a researcher who has a

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
large set of pictures of loads of

324
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
transport and you want to get them

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,000
labeled with what type of transport is

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
in each picture

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
you can pay intuition machines to get

328
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
labels attached to each picture

329
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
intuition machines crowd sources this

330
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
via age captcha

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,839
theoretically website owners get paid

332
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
for running age captcha and somehow

333
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
there's a blockchain in the middle

334
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
that's entirely not relevant to this

335
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
talk

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
so intuition machines claims on their

337
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
homepage that each captcha is three

338
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
things

339
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,519
private is and they don't track or sell

340
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,720
your data

341
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,959
secure as in it keeps on automation and

342
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
make sure the user's human and faster

343
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
and lower friction as in easy for users

344
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
so how does using age capture work

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,839
let's start by walking through their

346
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
visual timed workflow

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
uh i want to emphasize that everything

348
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
i'm about to talk about about this stuff

349
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
is how it stood a year ago when i did

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,200
this work

351
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
there have been some changes to date i

352
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
will be trying to call those out as i go

353
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
i also have a section later on where i

354
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
will explicitly call those out as

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
changes

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,959
so

357
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,200
you end up on a website

358
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
you start by filling out the form you

359
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,440
check the box labeled i am human

360
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
at this point the software looks at some

361
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
criteria

362
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
and takes a guess about whether or not

363
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
you might be a bot

364
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,519
the criteria that the system looks at

365
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
are an intuition machine secret

366
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
but there might be things like your ip

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
address if it's been able to put cookies

368
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
in your browser before your behavior on

369
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
the page so on and so forth

370
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
if you look like automation you get

371
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
shown a challenge

372
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,000
my personal experience across age

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
capture's website ebay again a year ago

374
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,519
when i was doing this cloudflare

375
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
and some other sites where i've run into

376
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
it is that when i see h captcha i get a

377
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
challenge

378
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,120
h captcha at least in part exists to get

379
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
data labeled so there's something of an

380
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,639
incentive to show as many photos as

381
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,440
possible to as many users as possible

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,880
of course it's also possible that

383
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
something about my profile is just

384
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,279
inherently suspicious

385
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,040
so let's continue with this visual timed

386
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
workflow

387
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,079
you'd then be presented a challenge like

388
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
this select all the images that contain

389
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
a boat you click them you click next

390
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
you repeat for a new set of images you

391
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,560
click verify

392
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,199
and finally that modal dialog goes away

393
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,360
box checks you're certified as human by

394
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
age captcha and on you go

395
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
so let's say you can't use that visual

396
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
time workflow perhaps you're blind you

397
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,160
can't identify images or you're

398
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
quadriplegic and you can't select the

399
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
images quickly enough

400
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,959
how do you get through age catches

401
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
challenge

402
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
you use their accessible workflow so

403
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
let's start walking through that again

404
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
as it stood a year ago

405
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
it starts in the same place with a form

406
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,760
to fill out and the iron human box to

407
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
check so you check the box

408
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
and that pops a challenge well you can't

409
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
do it

410
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
if you're lucky you don't spend a lot of

411
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,800
time trying and instead you start

412
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
looking for any kind of accessible

413
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
option

414
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,839
eventually you might find the burger

415
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,440
menu in the bottom left-hand corner of

416
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
that modal dialog and from there there's

417
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
an accessibility menu item you click on

418
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
that

419
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
brings you to a page where you can put

420
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,120
in your email to sign up for

421
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,199
accessibility access you submit that

422
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,240
form

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
it says it's going to send you an email

424
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
so you go check your email eventually an

425
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
email that looks like this shows up

426
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
um calling out a change

427
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
there's that thing that looks like a

428
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
button it's actually a link it's not a

429
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,079
button

430
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
but now they are explicitly putting the

431
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,519
text of the url below it so that if for

432
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
whatever reason you can't click a link

433
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
that looks like a button you can still

434
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
get through

435
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
so it's labeled get accessibility cookie

436
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
you click that

437
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
which means you do web page it looks

438
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,959
like this

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,120
you click set cookie

440
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,560
and a little notification lets you know

441
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
that the cookie is set

442
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
when i first tested this it seemed like

443
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
that cookie said announcement didn't

444
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
work i was to screen readers

445
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,759
when h capture reached out to me they

446
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,959
told me that this is something that they

447
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,320
regularly test and now this week i have

448
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
been able to go back and re-verify today

449
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
this works the cookie set text analysis

450
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
for your screen reader or browser you

451
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
know whatever software you're using is

452
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,959
as far as i was able to test

453
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,560
so whatever else may be the case age

454
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,399
capture does test for and fix

455
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
accessibility issues

456
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
anyway

457
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,320
you have a cookie you go back to the

458
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
form you were working on which has

459
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
probably timed out so you fill it in

460
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
again you check the item human box and

461
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
this time it just works

462
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
this actually seems like a pretty

463
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,279
reasonable process right at least to

464
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,360
cover the entire gamut of potential

465
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
assistive technology and disabilities

466
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
that might have trouble with the visual

467
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,639
time workflow

468
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,639
the process is seven or eight steps

469
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,480
assuming everything works properly some

470
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
of which involve waiting

471
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
the visual time workflow is three steps

472
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
that's a pretty huge difference

473
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,519
especially in comparison to other

474
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
catches which have accessible challenges

475
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,199
that add

476
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,079
one or no extra steps

477
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,599
however i also need to point out that

478
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
this is only the first time workflow it

479
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
does not always take so long

480
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,319
that cookie is good for some days one

481
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
set so you only have to deal with that

482
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
dashboard rarely

483
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,760
in the past i believed it was 24 hours

484
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
i've been informed by age capture but

485
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,039
that's not correct

486
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,039
once you have that age capture email

487
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
that we talked about earlier you can

488
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,919
always use that to get back to the

489
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,679
dashboard so you get to skip the sign-on

490
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,799
process

491
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,160
that makes this process a lot less

492
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
painful the second and subsequent times

493
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
through

494
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,880
still

495
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
it's pretty painful

496
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
so let's go back to what h capture said

497
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
it is and mark that

498
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,559
it's faster or lower friction except for

499
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
people with disabilities

500
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
now i've been told by age captcha that

501
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
they want to reduce the step count in

502
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
this workflow

503
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
but they didn't really have any

504
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
specifics about that that they wanted to

505
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
share with me

506
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
some other things that they have

507
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
proposed are very interesting but i will

508
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
get to that later on when we talk about

509
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
the future

510
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
so there's two big problems in how this

511
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
workflow works at least compared to the

512
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
visual time workflow

513
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,919
we're going to call the first one the

514
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,320
privacy problem

515
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
this is a screenshot of age captions

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
accessibility dashboard where you sign

517
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
in with that link that they send you

518
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
and in that upper right hand corner in a

519
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,559
red circle is at least part of the email

520
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,240
that i used to sign up for accessibility

521
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,520
yeah

522
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,120
that has some pretty significant privacy

523
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
implications it means that at least

524
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
theoretically every cookie h-caption

525
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,440
hands out via the accessible workflow

526
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
they could tie back to a specific email

527
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
effectively to a component of the

528
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
permanent identity of an individual

529
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
because age capture embeds in so many

530
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
places across the web they can follow

531
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799
that cookie and therefore that user

532
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,400
with most captchas if you don't want to

533
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,120
be tracked you can just bite cookies

534
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
but not with the accessibility workflow

535
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,919
for age captcha each cookie comes

536
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
potentially pre-tied to a user identity

537
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,039
i have been personally assured by the

538
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,200
person i spoke to at age captcha who i

539
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
do believe is in a position to know that

540
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
their infrastructure doesn't allow them

541
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,039
to tie cookies to users

542
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,559
however it's not something i can

543
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,919
personally verify

544
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
it also doesn't rule out such tied by

545
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
third parties or by them being compelled

546
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,720
to tie cookies to identities by a

547
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
government

548
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
so

549
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
let's go back to what they say they are

550
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
we're going to strike privacy we're

551
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
going to say private except for people

552
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
with disabilities and we're going to put

553
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
a big question mark after that to

554
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
indicate that we've been told it's

555
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
private but that we're not yet able to

556
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,480
verify that

557
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
i said there were two problems that was

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
privacy let's deal with security

559
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,400
i'm not the first person to look at

560
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
security there's a paper called a

561
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,919
low-cost attack against the age capture

562
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,120
system

563
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
which used their images as training for

564
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
machine learning was able to pass with a

565
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,600
95 success rate

566
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
h capture and cloudflare both dispute

567
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
the accuracy and methodology of the

568
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
study age capture in particular say the

569
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,320
researchers hit something they call an

570
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
anti-drain capability and that passing

571
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
the capture doesn't necessarily mean

572
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,520
passing the evaluation of being human

573
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
basically what they're saying through

574
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,960
their public statement here is that they

575
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,799
detected the researcher's automation

576
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,919
they passed them through the captcha

577
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
anyway

578
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
and

579
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,360
that's supposed to work

580
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
as far as i'm aware there's been no

581
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,600
re-evaluation or repetition of the study

582
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
so

583
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
take it for what it's worth

584
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
i would call it disputed at this point

585
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
so we'll go back to what they are and

586
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
we'll put a question mark next to secure

587
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
in my opinion we as members of the

588
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
public right now really don't have

589
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
enough information and the truth there

590
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
so quick pop quiz before we go into the

591
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
second problem

592
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
where does the accessible workflow

593
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,919
actually verify that the user is human

594
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,919
show event

595
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,679
yeah show of hands

596
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,240
for those uh so a is it when the user

597
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
clicks a button

598
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
b when the user enters their email

599
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,240
c when the user opens a link in an email

600
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
or d

601
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
whenever you want

602
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
just check the user agent of the browser

603
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
i can't see the room but those of you

604
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,760
who didn't raise your hands were

605
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
actually the most correct there's no

606
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
part of that process that actually does

607
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
a verifiable check that you're human

608
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
um that means that no part is ai hard

609
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,720
and no part is difficult to automate

610
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
so this video that i'm about to talk

611
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
over is of some quick automation i put

612
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
together to prove that this process can

613
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
be automated

614
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
it's not anything particularly fancy

615
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,760
it's just x do tool driving mouse a

616
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,200
little custom python to run a mail

617
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,559
server

618
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
and as you can see or we'll see in a

619
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,559
moment is perfectly capable of running

620
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,760
through the entire accessibility

621
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,000
workflow on its own

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
putting this together is actually pretty

623
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,280
darn interesting when you hit a counter

624
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,919
measure any part of the system simply

625
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,120
kicks back a contact support error

626
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,559
debugging without any feedback other

627
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
than you hit a counter measure but you

628
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
can't know what it is is

629
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
pretty fun

630
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,440
so

631
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
one other thing that was a challenge to

632
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
me personally was handling this incoming

633
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,080
email

634
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
i had never dealt with handling incoming

635
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
email before in a programmatic way it

636
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
was originally trying to set up an email

637
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
server that would pipe the body of the

638
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,520
email to custom python script which did

639
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,120
not work out

640
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,280
but i can say that python has a good

641
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,000
module called smtpd that is

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,360
got great callbacks for handling

643
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
incoming email messages

644
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
all right at this point we're going to

645
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
take another version age capture does

646
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
have counter measures to automation

647
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,720
and that appear at least to be mostly in

648
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
the form of rate limiting

649
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
so at least that i've been able to see

650
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
and hit myself

651
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
each cookie that you get from the

652
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
accessibility workflow can only be used

653
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,840
so many times each account only gets so

654
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
many cookies per day

655
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
each ip address can only sign up for so

656
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
many accounts per day and each domain

657
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,919
can only sign up for so many accounts

658
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,039
per day

659
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
but domains are cheap rotating ip

660
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,320
address is easy

661
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,919
and so i can't verify how effective

662
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
these are in the real world

663
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,080
so we'll go back to what age catch is or

664
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
was a year ago we're going to strike

665
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
secure and say accept that it appears it

666
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
can be automated

667
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
h captcha's initial written response to

668
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,600
me of course said that i'd most likely

669
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
been caught in a similar anti-drain

670
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
capability and was being allowed to pass

671
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,159
even though they detected my automation

672
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,480
this is a pretty convenient answer when

673
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,559
researchers start poking your stuff we

674
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
detected you attacking us and we decided

675
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,280
to let you believe that you were

676
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
successful

677
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
as a security researcher that means that

678
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
i can't verify either way whether or not

679
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,480
i had been successful or not

680
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
so for now we're saying it looks like

681
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
the automation was successful and any

682
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,840
true verification

683
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,279
would have had to cross the line into

684
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,520
real attacks on the system

685
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,039
which we can't do as technical

686
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
researchers

687
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
so

688
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
by now i hope i've convinced you that

689
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
their accessibility workflow is

690
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,799
or appears to be broken

691
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,080
all the work i did on it was under their

692
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,919
bug bounty program so i've disclosed it

693
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,279
to them and i've disclosed it to

694
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,360
cloudflare who run a second instance of

695
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,919
the age capture software

696
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,760
both of them was declared declared that

697
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,960
it was not an issue due to the

698
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
mitigations that they had and declined

699
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,320
to disclose or it wasn't an issue due to

700
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,080
resources required to circumvent the

701
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
captcha

702
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
um i'd actually like to give a positive

703
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
shout out to cloudflare

704
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,200
it's not their software they had it

705
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
pretty well and they had a very

706
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,279
well-written reason for why it wasn't a

707
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
security issue but they still paid out

708
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
on their bug bounty

709
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,400
so

710
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
i've alluded to it but one big question

711
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,840
that this raises that i'm not going to

712
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
focus on

713
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
is how should bug bounties deal with

714
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,279
non-verifiable systems where there isn't

715
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,840
a binary between it worked and it didn't

716
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
work

717
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,039
and how should that be done especially

718
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
when the party responsible for the

719
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,799
verification of the security issue is

720
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
also the one that pays out on the bounty

721
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
this is not a criticism of age captcha

722
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
this is looking beyond it to the

723
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
industry as a whole

724
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,080
so please take it in that sense

725
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
so let's talk about what's changed that

726
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,039
i haven't already mentioned

727
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,559
one thing i was told about is something

728
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,520
that age capture calls their 99.9 mode

729
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,279
in this mode the captcha is entirely

730
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,960
invisible unless there's a reason to

731
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
challenge you

732
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,559
the name comes from their goal of only

733
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
challenging a tenth of a percent of

734
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
legitimate users

735
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,960
so when you see h captcha

736
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,679
congratulations you're very lucky

737
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,000
now i haven't been able to verify

738
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
anything about how well this works or

739
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,039
anything like that beyond the text

740
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
that's on their enterprise level

741
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
marketing page

742
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
if you know how to write browser

743
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,039
extensions i can monitor for things like

744
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
this i'd love to hear from you because

745
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
that's my next step with this work

746
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
speaking of age capture being often

747
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,760
invisible i was talking about this work

748
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
with a friend of mine who made a rather

749
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
brilliant

750
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
with hcapture being invisible except

751
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,279
when it thinks in your automation it

752
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
quickly becomes the annoying thing that

753
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
always makes you do a stupid puzzle

754
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
because you only see it when it makes

755
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
you feel poggle

756
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,240
in contrast recaptcha at least lets you

757
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
know it's there which means that when it

758
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
makes you do a puzzle it's a little more

759
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
tolerable because you know that you've

760
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,600
passed through it a few times before

761
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
so other good things that i heard from

762
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,279
them but

763
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,960
not being a company insider can't verify

764
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
first thing that i've heard and i really

765
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
hope this one is true

766
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,000
their training set for what is human

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
includes users of various assistive

768
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
technologies

769
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,559
this implies that these users are not

770
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,799
getting picked out as automation at

771
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,080
least because of their assistive

772
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,120
technology i hope

773
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
i was also told that they do run manual

774
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
testing of their entire system with some

775
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
frequency both in-house and via

776
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
third-party accessibility testing

777
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,919
services

778
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,200
though the person i was talking to

779
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
didn't remember exactly how frequently

780
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
um

781
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
from the point of view of assuring more

782
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,039
or less equal access these are both

783
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
really great things this means that my

784
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
largest criticism of age caption at this

785
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,080
moment

786
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
is that their accessibility workflow is

787
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
significantly longer than their visual

788
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
timed workflow

789
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,440
so

790
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,880
in the past

791
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,400
in checking some of this over again to

792
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,679
see if things are still vulnerable i

793
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,640
thought that they'd shut down their

794
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
automated registration because i

795
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
couldn't sign up for accounts i was able

796
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
to run through an accessibility signup

797
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,360
myself this week it does still work

798
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
so this is a place where i think i hit a

799
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
counter measure and was entirely unaware

800
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
of it

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
however hitting that counter measure in

802
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
the past did let me test a more manual

803
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,159
process where you get in touch with

804
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,600
their support

805
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
in that version you have to email

806
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
support and wait for a human support

807
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
person to handle your ticket

808
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,360
when they do this or when i did this

809
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,440
they asked for my ip address my browser

810
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
what website i was on and what about age

811
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
caption didn't work for me

812
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,760
as someone who wrote an email saying hi

813
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,279
i need to sign up for an accessibility

814
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
account that last bit is particularly

815
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
critical

816
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,919
it doesn't quite require disclosing a

817
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
disability but it does get pretty close

818
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,080
then i can't see the photos isn't the

819
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,919
same as saying i'm blind but it has the

820
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,760
same effect

821
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,600
all that said i've been told that this

822
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
is a place that they are willing and

823
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,240
trying to improve i've been told that

824
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
they have changed how they ask this

825
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,559
question

826
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,240
and they have been asked for feedback on

827
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
how to better ask the question

828
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,080
so if you have thoughts on this i would

829
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
also love to hear those thoughts because

830
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
i can convey them through 2h capture

831
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
themselves

832
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
so enough about h caption let's take a

833
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,440
step back and look at the bigger picture

834
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
how'd this design come from well okay a

835
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,720
little more about age capture how did

836
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
this come to be

837
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
um i want to be clear that this section

838
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,760
is derived entirely from their public

839
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,320
writings despite my opportunity to talk

840
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
to them i did not ask them about how to

841
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
do how

842
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
about their engineering process

843
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
no private information

844
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,320
so hcapps is data labeling service they

845
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
need data to label

846
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,960
computers typically put out only audios

847
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,279
and audio and visuals not so much for

848
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,880
the other senses

849
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,200
so captures will tend to be either audio

850
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,000
or visual captures

851
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,919
most capture services that provide any

852
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,919
kind of accessibility provide it as an

853
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,679
alternative audio capture for those who

854
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,880
cannot complete visual captures

855
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
each captcha or at least their support

856
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,679
folks believe and this is a direct quote

857
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
that audio options provide virtually no

858
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,240
security end quote and that google's

859
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,159
recapture disables audio captures if it

860
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,720
believes traffic is suspicious

861
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
i found no evidence for the part about

862
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
recapture disabling audio captures

863
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
despite a ton of questions across the

864
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
internet asking how to do that

865
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
so i think that this belief that audio

866
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,600
captures are low security is what led

867
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
hcap should choose to do a visual only

868
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
capture after all it will be very high

869
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
security

870
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
but somewhere along the way someone

871
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,760
realized they need to make this

872
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
accessible

873
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
to that credit it really does appear

874
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,399
that they implemented this accessible

875
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,520
workflow before launching the product

876
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
however discovering the accessibility

877
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
requirement might have been a good time

878
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,480
to step back and reconsider no audio

879
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
captures or at least the level of

880
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,679
difficulty and involvement that is

881
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
involved in their accessibility workflow

882
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,159
so

883
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
somehow they came through and came up

884
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,559
with this long accessibility workflow in

885
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,159
order to avoid audio captures

886
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,360
so it doesn't quite work what's next

887
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,279
outside of the current state each

888
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,880
captures as they're moving to a new

889
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
text-based challenge system this is the

890
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
system i alluded to earlier that's both

891
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
accessible and protects the privacy of

892
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,360
users of the accessible workflows as

893
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,559
much as the of other users

894
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
let me rephrase that this workflow will

895
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,120
be equally private to all to the other

896
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,880
workflow

897
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,919
so

898
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,039
this workflow text based challenges has

899
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,880
you answer questions like this one what

900
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
object can tell time and makes its

901
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
determinations based on that

902
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
the person who spoke with that age

903
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,039
capture said direct quote ensuring that

904
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,720
this translates well in every language

905
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
cultural context and device state across

906
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
our scale is a daunting task end quote

907
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,440
and i believe it this has a lot of

908
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
challenges around culture and language

909
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,919
however if this is done well it's going

910
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,760
to be amazing for certain populations

911
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
with disabilities

912
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,279
it's one of the very few if not the only

913
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,559
captcha that would actually be

914
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,679
accessible to people who are deaf-blind

915
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
it could be bad for others for example

916
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
those who are cognitively impaired

917
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
in some ways it's a game changer and

918
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,679
once it rolls out it means age caption

919
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,440
is going to be the best capture on the

920
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,039
market in terms of accessibility and

921
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,720
privacy or

922
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,159
in terms of accessibility privacy and

923
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,399
the combination of both

924
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,360
enough so that once this rolls out i

925
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
will recommend using them

926
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,519
h captcha has told me that they are

927
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,519
still actively working on this this is

928
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,799
in beta and it's something that

929
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,960
customers can opt into for their

930
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,919
captchas so if anybody in the audience

931
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,000
is an h capture customer and you're not

932
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,320
using this please please please go in

933
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,600
turn it on

934
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,679
and

935
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,880
excuse me

936
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
go and turn it on and make sure it's

937
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,519
available for the users of your website

938
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,200
i've been told that this will be wrong

939
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
has been

940
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
in beta for about eight or nine months

941
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
it should be rolling out in the next few

942
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
months

943
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
depending on the current uptake and how

944
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,760
that affects the speed of their ability

945
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
to validate the data set

946
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
so closing thought on age captcha they

947
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
are really close to being a

948
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,279
best-in-class accessible effective and

949
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,240
privacy-first anti-automation product

950
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
once that text-based challenge rolls out

951
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
for all of that all of their captions

952
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
they are going to be the best product

953
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
out there for things that are accessible

954
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
effective and privacy first for

955
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,279
protection from automation

956
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,279
so watch for that to happen

957
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
okay now i'm really done with age

958
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,279
captcha what about others

959
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,799
we're starting to see decoupling of

960
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,799
automation detection from any heart

961
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,440
problems in order to two other methods

962
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,000
of differentiating human from automation

963
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
so this raises the question do we

964
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,640
continue using our human easy problems

965
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
what do we do when these are exhausted

966
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
and are there other more effective ways

967
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
to handle automation on the internet

968
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,159
and how will any future solution

969
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,519
interact with accessibility

970
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
so let's start with what i wouldn't use

971
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,279
nothing that is a visual only caption

972
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,640
you know type the letters type the

973
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,720
numbers whatever these are just

974
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
inaccessible for certain people

975
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,799
and they're easily solved by automation

976
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,919
at this point

977
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,679
so they're providing pretty minimal

978
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,679
security authority

979
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
at this point i would like to take the

980
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,200
opportunity to call out an internet

981
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
darling wikimedia

982
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,240
they use one of these caches visual only

983
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,960
they've also got a bug that's 16 years

984
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,360
old pointing out that it's inaccessible

985
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
people have written code people have

986
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
written whole new captions they've even

987
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,559
considered moving to age captcha but

988
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,159
they haven't changed that

989
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
as far as i can tell this is simply due

990
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
to lack of institutional will

991
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,919
instead they come up with a process

992
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
where users reach out to admins manually

993
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
similar to a lot we talked about with

994
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,840
age captcha but even longer even

995
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,399
worse

996
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,200
so

997
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
other things i wouldn't use

998
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
anything that is this slide the puzzle

999
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
piece capture

1000
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
as simple as they look if they're not

1001
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,719
providing an alternative they exclude

1002
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
anyone who can't operate a mouse

1003
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
and many of them are built by companies

1004
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,639
that are located in places without

1005
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
strong disability access laws so don't

1006
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
expect to see any accessible options

1007
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,279
from them soon

1008
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
so all of that is a long way of saying

1009
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,639
hcats is actually one of the better

1010
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
capture options when you're examining

1011
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,800
security accessibility and privacy

1012
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,760
they've at least thought about

1013
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,359
accessibility which is more than can be

1014
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,760
said for many of their competitors

1015
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
they've got a very strong story around

1016
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,960
privacy if you can use the visual time

1017
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,159
workflow

1018
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,239
in my current estimation

1019
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,639
with accessibility as a top priority

1020
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,239
they are the second best captcha

1021
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,480
currently available and again as soon as

1022
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
that text-based challenge rolls out they

1023
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,399
will be the best

1024
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560
honestly the fact they're so close to

1025
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
being the best is what makes it all the

1026
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,839
more frustrating that their

1027
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,040
accessibility is currently so long and

1028
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,320
in my opinion problematic

1029
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,640
we've already talked about recaptcha and

1030
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
the i'm not a robot checkbox so looking

1031
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
more towards the future

1032
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
this represents another option using

1033
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,520
patterns and machine learning to

1034
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,480
determine if user is automation or human

1035
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,760
however there's always going to be

1036
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
marginal cases which have to fall back

1037
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,359
to something if you're using only

1038
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,640
machine learning

1039
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,079
probably that means falling back to one

1040
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,040
of these air human easy problems

1041
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,240
it increases the difficulty of

1042
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
circumventing the captcha

1043
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
because now the automation has to at

1044
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,760
least behave like a human

1045
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
have a full browser probably operated

1046
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,440
human speed but

1047
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,520
this doesn't actually stop automation it

1048
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,839
just slows it down

1049
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,359
so at this point i want to make my

1050
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,680
radical proposal the age of the couch is

1051
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,000
over it's time to replace it

1052
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,079
i base this on two things first

1053
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,160
shrinking category of ai hard human easy

1054
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,000
problems quite frankly i think we're

1055
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
just running out of problems in this

1056
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
class as ai becomes better and better at

1057
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,599
solving more and more problems

1058
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
second quite honestly the fact that

1059
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
capture farms exist

1060
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
means that these characters aren't even

1061
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,480
particularly reliable today we've got

1062
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,119
humans solving them some sources have

1063
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,280
even placed the cost as low as a dollar

1064
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,960
for a thousand solves of captions

1065
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,079
so

1066
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,839
what's next captures are used for a lot

1067
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
of purposes broadly speaking i split

1068
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
these into two categories they're bot

1069
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
prevention and there's data integrity

1070
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,880
protection

1071
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
bond prevention includes a lot of things

1072
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
but primarily it's about the fairness of

1073
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,520
resource usage in this case websites are

1074
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
showing a captcha if user's doing

1075
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
something that may be unfair to other

1076
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
users

1077
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,640
for example if they're requesting too

1078
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,079
many pages too quickly you're trying to

1079
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,160
log in too often which might be an

1080
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,880
attempt to guess passwords

1081
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,800
in this case caches are often a

1082
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
primitive form of rate limiting so

1083
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
why not go straight to actuary limiting

1084
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
as a living example of this project

1085
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,839
gutenberg is perfectly happy for you to

1086
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,760
download their full library as long as

1087
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
you do it slowly enough not to impact

1088
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
other users

1089
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,160
then actually hand out a curl command

1090
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
line to allow users to do that

1091
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
so data integrity protection is more

1092
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,880
about making sure that only good data is

1093
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
getting into systems

1094
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
spam protection

1095
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
this is a much harder problem partially

1096
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
due to the flexible nature of what is

1097
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,359
and isn't spam a post about photo

1098
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,200
editing stuff on a photography forum

1099
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
probably not spam

1100
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
on a knitting forum

1101
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
probably is there

1102
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
the nerd in me wants to suggest ai as

1103
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
the solution to this but honestly it's

1104
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,480
probably too complicated for most sites

1105
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,960
to set up i'm just doing absent someone

1106
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
creating a really good way of building

1107
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
user-friendly generalized ai anti-stand

1108
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
systems which

1109
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
is a tall order

1110
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,160
problem's complicated if a site or

1111
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,440
service requires payment you could

1112
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,520
require a valid credit card if not

1113
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,200
perhaps a valid email from a trusted

1114
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
provider

1115
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
but what these solutions have in common

1116
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
is making the validation of the user

1117
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
someone else's problem

1118
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
you're thinking that sounds like it

1119
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,560
might be federated or social assignment

1120
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,960
it kind of does to me too

1121
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,200
beyond this i'm not honestly sure what

1122
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,119
you can do beyond paying a company to

1123
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,560
do this determination for you

1124
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,320
um basically i'm not sure what a website

1125
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
owner without a high degree of technical

1126
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,720
expertise can do

1127
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,480
personally though i'm beginning to think

1128
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,839
something hardware based is the way to

1129
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,720
go

1130
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,040
and it turns out i'm not alone

1131
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,240
cloudflare rolled out something that

1132
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
they call cryptographic attestation of

1133
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
personhood in 2021.

1134
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,240
this uses fido security keys in order to

1135
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,560
verify the user cloudflare claims that

1136
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,160
this lets you anonymously test to be a

1137
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,640
real person being a real person

1138
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
without having to solve any puzzle and

1139
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
it takes about five seconds basically

1140
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
you have a fido key it challenges you

1141
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
you press your button and off something

1142
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,839
goes

1143
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,280
and they don't get any more information

1144
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
than you are one of

1145
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,079
the keys in a set of no smaller than 10

1146
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,000
000.

1147
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
however it's pressing a button it's

1148
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,839
vulnerable to what cloudflare calls the

1149
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,839
drinking bird attack

1150
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
basically these tokens verify that a

1151
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,040
button is being pushed not that there's

1152
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,760
an actual human there pushing the button

1153
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
to cloudflare this isn't an issue they

1154
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,800
point out that the attestation process

1155
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
on the devices which includes some

1156
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
public cryptography

1157
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,079
takes long enough that it's actually

1158
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,480
slower than most modern capture forms

1159
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
so therefore this method may not

1160
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
perfectly prevent automation but it does

1161
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,599
slow it down compared to current

1162
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
solutions

1163
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
as i was prepping this talk i was

1164
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,240
thinking that's really neat but why do i

1165
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
need a separate device why not build

1166
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,960
this into the laptop or the phone

1167
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,880
as it turns out cloudflare got there

1168
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,760
first

1169
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
on june 22nd this year they rolled out

1170
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
something they called private access

1171
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
tokens

1172
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,079
for now this only works with apple

1173
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,359
devices

1174
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,960
however what does is allow the

1175
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,520
attestation of personhood without any

1176
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
dedicated device

1177
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
in this process you go somewhere

1178
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,359
cloudflare asks apple to attest to your

1179
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,320
device

1180
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,000
cloudflare learns your ip address what

1181
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
web page you want to visit but no device

1182
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
ids

1183
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
on the flip side apple learns the device

1184
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,800
ids but nothing about what website you

1185
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
want to visit

1186
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,480
uh in cloudflare's estimation this is

1187
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
quicker and more privacy protecting than

1188
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,880
their previous solutions

1189
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,960
and it's built using open standards so

1190
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
expect other manufacturers to start

1191
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,960
providing it soon i hope

1192
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,640
the person i spoke with at age capture

1193
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,319
said that they actually have hooks built

1194
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,160
in for protocols like this and they're

1195
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,800
hoping to roll this same

1196
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,319
private access token out to their

1197
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,400
customers shortly i think it was private

1198
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,720
access token

1199
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,680
nor is h capture alone

1200
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
or apple or cloudflare it seems there

1201
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,400
are indicators that most or all of the

1202
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
major players in the attestation of

1203
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,200
personhood or capture space

1204
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,040
including apple and microsoft are

1205
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,800
looking at things like this where you

1206
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
don't have to do anything

1207
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,200
so basically zero interaction

1208
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,319
verification of humanity

1209
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,640
so let's come back to accessibility how

1210
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,040
does this relate to that well a lot of

1211
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,359
these hardware-based solutions are

1212
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,440
minimal or no interaction

1213
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
this actually works out really well for

1214
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,240
people with disabilities if you don't

1215
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
need to interact with a device

1216
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,240
it's inherently equally accessible to

1217
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,319
everybody

1218
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,000
minimal interaction like the ones that

1219
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,359
require pressing a button could still be

1220
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
a problem for some people such as people

1221
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,280
who are quadriplegic

1222
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
so i'd like to see manufacturers

1223
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,119
make tokens that are usable by those

1224
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,880
people

1225
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,119
so given the option though i'd really

1226
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
recommend going with some kind of zero

1227
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,440
interaction attestation protocol

1228
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,359
it's inherently accessible it will

1229
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,119
reduce friction for users at the same

1230
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,400
time

1231
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,280
basically it's a win all around

1232
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,359
finally to wrap up this section on the

1233
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,680
future i believe the captcha at least in

1234
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
the form of solving a puzzle is going

1235
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,880
away

1236
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
it's just a matter of when and how

1237
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,599
a future where automation doesn't flood

1238
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,680
the internet with spam your device can

1239
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,440
automatically be verified completely

1240
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
privately

1241
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,720
and you never see a cacha sounds pretty

1242
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,200
darn nice doesn't it

1243
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,119
all right as i wrap up when you go on

1244
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,200
towards questions and then you all go on

1245
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
towards your next talks what do i want

1246
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,480
you thinking about

1247
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,040
three things first when doing design

1248
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,560
make sure you're considering all users

1249
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,079
and requirements

1250
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,319
adding accessibility at the end is

1251
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,240
probably part of what made age captcha's

1252
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,359
process take so long

1253
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,119
second be aware of what happens at the

1254
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,359
margins i spoke a lot about human easy

1255
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,760
problems but for whom are these problems

1256
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,040
actually easy is it actually all humans

1257
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,200
every design decision that is made is a

1258
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
trade-off even the ones you think

1259
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
probably aren't

1260
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,400
a fancy searchable drop down box might

1261
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,319
be inaccessible to a screen reader user

1262
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,240
so for every decision that you're making

1263
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
consider who's at the margins and how

1264
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,880
that decision is affecting them

1265
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
third design for a mainstream that works

1266
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,319
for everyone when it comes to

1267
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,000
accessibility trying to create and

1268
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
maintain parallel workflows or products

1269
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,319
is a pretty good way to end up breaking

1270
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,079
your entire system

1271
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,040
and if it helps to think of it this way

1272
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,839
inaccessibility separate is never equal

1273
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
and at this point i am very happy to

1274
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,040
answer your questions

1275
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,440
all right so if anyone has any questions

1276
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,720
go ahead and go up to the mic and you

1277
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,000
can ask him directly and he'll be able

1278
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
to hear you i don't know if anyone has

1279
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,040
any questions for

1280
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,920
for steven today

1281
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,839
uh we also don't have any questions on

1282
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,800
the chat stephen up we might uh one

1283
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,880
typing on the chat yeah i see that right

1284
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,839
now

1285
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,839
still typing

1286
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,240
gives everybody in the room a chance to

1287
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,240
think

1288
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,680
i mean on a personal curiosity are there

1289
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,040
any other strategies that are being

1290
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,359
explored in terms of this type of

1291
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,319
validation outside of you know text and

1292
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,520
visual and sound based

1293
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,280
the hardware-based tokens are are the

1294
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,440
biggest one that i am aware of um

1295
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
honestly i would say at this point there

1296
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,319
seems to have been something of an

1297
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,079
industry realization that the capture as

1298
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,400
it stands as a puzzle isn't the way of

1299
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,760
the future

1300
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
um and it seems like every time i turn

1301
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
around there's somebody proposing

1302
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,040
something new

1303
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,560
um so

1304
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,319
while i can't think of anything else

1305
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,480
that isn't hardware based right now

1306
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,280
i'm sure there's something out there

1307
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,960
all right we have the question in the

1308
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,880
chat you talked about would be

1309
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,720
accessible privacy first captchas but

1310
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
with caveats

1311
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,160
what do you recommend for one right now

1312
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,680
before the next generation solutions

1313
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,319
come online

1314
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,280
okay

1315
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,960
yes um

1316
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,319
so

1317
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,200
right now i think if you want a captcha

1318
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,160
that is accessible that is verifiably

1319
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,359
private or at least privacy first

1320
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,440
there really isn't a perfect solution on

1321
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,920
the market

1322
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,359
for

1323
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,520
for accessible anything that's providing

1324
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,240
both visual and audio should be good

1325
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,560
enough

1326
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,319
with the knowledge that the first time

1327
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,920
through age capture is very high

1328
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,000
friction you can certainly consider them

1329
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,520
i think they're doing a

1330
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,960
they're trying is is uh what i will say

1331
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,200
um but i really do want to emphasize

1332
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,079
that

1333
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,480
when age capture comes online and it

1334
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
brings their text based challenge online

1335
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,319
they will be the clear winner there will

1336
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,079
be no question about it if you want to

1337
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,280
captcha

1338
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,839
after that's online go to age capture it

1339
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,920
will be accessible they will be privacy

1340
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,800
first they will be verifiably private if

1341
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,000
you want to you know dig through

1342
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,280
protocols and run a browser extension

1343
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
and they're going to have that for

1344
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,359
all of their users so it won't matter if

1345
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,880
you're someone who needs assistive

1346
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
technology or someone who doesn't you

1347
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,119
will have the same level of experience

1348
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,520
with their captcha once text based

1349
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,319
challenges online

1350
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,160
uh another question what are some

1351
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
affordable options for people who want

1352
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,480
to implement captchas on their personal

1353
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,880
sites or for something you know a small

1354
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,440
project are there affordable options or

1355
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,880
free options that are useful

1356
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,920
yes

1357
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,680
both h-capture and recapture i believe

1358
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,030
have free options right now

1359
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,280
[Music]

1360
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,599
if you're

1361
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,480
looking for something that's

1362
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,079
self-hosting i'm afraid i don't have a

1363
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,359
good answer for you just because i

1364
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,800
haven't done sufficient research into

1365
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,040
self-hosted couches

1366
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
mostly i've honestly been focused on the

1367
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,799
the commercial side

1368
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,680
excellent well are there any other

1369
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,000
questions from the room or from the chat

1370
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
well it looks like we might have another

1371
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,200
question coming in on the chat

1372
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,319
thoughts about talks about fighters and

1373
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,359
pass

1374
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,960
um

1375
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,880
i haven't dug into the crypto privacy

1376
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,319
pass so with that caveat

1377
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:40,650
um

1378
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,960
[Music]

1379
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
privacy pass is a little complicated

1380
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,240
right now um in my opinion

1381
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,760
the reason i say it's complicated right

1382
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,640
now is that it works quite well if you

1383
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,240
don't if you can use the visual time

1384
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,160
workflow

1385
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,480
um i actually went back and re-verified

1386
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,960
this week right now with the accessible

1387
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,440
workflow um that i just talked about it

1388
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,520
doesn't work so you cannot use privacy

1389
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,119
pass

1390
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,040
and if you i have seen um some sites

1391
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,200
that have their their beta of the

1392
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,440
text-based challenge excuse me h-capture

1393
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,880
is beta of the text-based challenge

1394
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
but privacy passes challenge for

1395
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,520
captchas is not one of them

1396
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,480
um

1397
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,839
so

1398
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,440
right now privacy pass is useful if you

1399
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,760
can use the visual time workflow

1400
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,040
if you can't then that's

1401
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,319
in all honesty that's a place where

1402
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,720
right now age captcha is impacting the

1403
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,240
privacy of people who need to use the

1404
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,240
accessible workflow in a negative way

1405
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,680
um

1406
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,720
so complicated feelings

1407
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,880
or complicated answer that boils down to

1408
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
they need to turn on the text based

1409
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,800
challenge for privacy pass and once that

1410
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,640
challenge is turned on

1411
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,119
have at it verifiably private

1412
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,319
you know blinded tokens is a great thing

1413
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,079
it just needs to be actually accessible

1414
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,440
before i can fully recommend it

1415
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,160
excellent all right well thank you so

1416
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,599
much for your time steven we really

1417
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,760

1418
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,280
thank you

1419
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,359
and if anyone wants to follow up with

1420
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,599
stephen again the matrix chat will be

1421
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,359
open for the rest of the conference and

1422
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,040
beyond so you can interact directly with

1423
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,960
stephen for any further questions or any

1424
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,480
materials from his presentations for the

1425
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,599
chat

1426
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,760
and so thank you again stephen uh come

1427

back in

1428
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
10 minutes for the next chat botnets are

1429
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,400
the best way to measure user hostile

1430
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
behavior on the internet

1431
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,960
thank you for being attending

1432
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,640
