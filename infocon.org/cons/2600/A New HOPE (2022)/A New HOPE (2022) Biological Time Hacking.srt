1
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,799
good morning everyone

2
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
welcome to the third day of hope

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
and we're very glad everyone's here and

4
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
we're looking forward to the closing

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,240
ceremonies tonight please join us

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
it'll be a blast

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
and on to our next speaker

8
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
everyone in this room has pushed their

9
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
bodies too far at some point in their

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,920
lives

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
and everyone here knows what happens

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
when your body nopes out

13
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
for example if you go without sleep you

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,759
collapse

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,439
our next speaker though has a novel

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
solution to optimizing performance of

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
our bodies in this

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
hectic chaotic modern world

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
please welcome kenji larson

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
thanks very much

21
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,880
so my talk is biological time hacking um

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,479
i make a lot of devices and i have a lot

23
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
of projects and i basically never have

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
enough time to do all things i want so

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
um and because i make devices sometimes

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
people say you know what you really

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
should do is just build a time machine

28
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
well i don't really know how to do that

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
but um i thought about it a little bit

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,280
and i realized you know the type of time

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
machine where you travel around in time

32
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,959
go back and forth and do things not only

33
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,319
a lot of problems with that just in

34
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
general but

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
it's not the kind of time machine i want

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,200
the time machine i want is one that

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
produces more time

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
right so um but let's take a look

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
the components here are biological time

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
and hacking now

41
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,400
i say biological because i actually

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
pretty obsessed with process in general

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
and i realized uh there are other types

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
of time hacking that you can do

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
organizational time hacking

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,040
uh psychological time hacking i have

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,519
plenty to say about those things but

48
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,720
the one the like underserved type of

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
time hacking is really biological so

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
that's what this is about

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
hacking is an important

52
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
part of this talk not just because of

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
this conference but also

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,200
it's about using your time for your

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
purposes and i think that's really

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
important because uh what i'm not here

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
to tell you is

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
uh you know eat regular meals get some

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
exercise sleep well and you know you'll

60
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,599
add like seven days to the end of your

61
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,480
life

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
you know that's not really my purpose so

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
my purpose is if you want more time in

64
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
the day or for a particular week because

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
you've got a project to do or you have

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
some uh idea of how you want to spend

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
your time then you should just do that

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
but this is not a talk about your health

69
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,519
it's not a talk about uh uh uh

70
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,000
you know about uh not trying to die or

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
something like this it's really just uh

72
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
however you would like to use the time

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
you have or you think you have uh here's

74
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,360
how to do it more efficiently and so um

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,599
i think time is actually our most

76
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
valuable asset and we our language

77
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
really uses a lot of that stuff

78
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,599
a lot of um

79
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
excuse me a lot of

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
phrases that are equivalent

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
to things that have value so you hear us

82
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,439
spending time you hear us saving time

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
and you've heard time is money

84
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
well

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
i think there's some differences

86
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,000
this is the arrow of time it only goes

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,798
in one direction never goes back

88
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
here's the arrow of money as you may

89
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,160
have seen recently i put a little

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
positive note at the end so hopefully

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
things go but the point is that money is

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
flexible you can get

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
you can lose your money and you can get

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,479
more money back

95
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,160
but once you've lost your time you can

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
never get that back that is just spent

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
so in my opinion time is much more

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,759
valuable

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
than money time is not equal to money

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
so let's look at

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
this year here's a representation of

102
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
this year this is every day this year

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
all of the red squares indicate uh

104
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
days that are gone by the yellow square

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
is uh where we are today and the blue

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
squares indicate all the rest of this

107
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
year and

108
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
that's the future now

109
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
the funny thing about that is that while

110
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
the past has been determined the future

111
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,120
has not so therefore you actually can't

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
count on all of these blue squares it's

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
actually uh you know i i might get hit

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
by a bus tomorrow and not have all of

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
these blue squares so i think it's very

116
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
important uh for me to maximize my use

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
of time in the ways that i want to and

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
by the way it doesn't mean that i just

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
have to be working on project i can be

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
use that time for relaxing or something

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
else so just to be clear freedom of

122
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,680
choice for your use of time

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
but let's look at this year in the

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
context of my life

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,320
here we are

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
these are all the days of my life

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
uh and in the past you can see all red

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
you can see i'm way over the hump as

129
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,520
as per expect expected time the blue is

130
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
the future that is predicted by average

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
lifespan in the u.s okay not totally

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
relevant maybe for me but uh

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,840
so but again it could be much much

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
shorter and it could be much much longer

135
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
the green squares indicate the future

136
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
that is past the average so it might be

137
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,479
a

138
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,800
you know some kind of awesome future uh

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
where i live long many people live to

140
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
100 nowadays so that might be a

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
possibility for me but again

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
i might meet that bus tomorrow so

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
um

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
the other thing that can happen in the

145
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
blue area or the green area is that i

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
live long enough to

147
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
allow technology

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
to provide things like 3d printed organs

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
pharmaceuticals you know other types of

150
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
science and technology and technology

151
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
innovations that allow me to increase my

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,199
health span and my lifespan and that way

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
i'll get more time but i'm not going to

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,479
tell you about that because that's not

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,680
hacking

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
this i'm trying to hack the system that

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
we have right now and hopefully i'll

158
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,639
live long enough by doing that to get to

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
that future

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
here's this year think about it

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
okay the things we spend time on

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,680
breathing

163
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
eating drinking

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
eliminating the things we've consumed

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
sleeping and also focusing now focusing

166
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,800
is actually something that has

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
biological inputs you can absolutely be

168
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
distracted if you didn't sleep right uh

169
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
and it impairs your ability to focus so

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
we'll talk about that from a biological

171
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
perspective but then there's all the

172
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,639
things that you might be focusing on

173
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
work vote your vocation hobbies

174
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
your obligations self-actualization

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
relaxation uh you know socializing any

176
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
any any anything you basically uh can

177
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
think of that you do during your life

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
but the difference is that things on the

179
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,639
left are biological inputs

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
there are things that you absolutely

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,039
must do your body will absolutely not

182
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,120
continue if you don't do these things

183
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
that even includes focusing the brain

184
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
needs information to stay lively

185
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
etc

186
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,120
these other things

187
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
are things you choose and when i say

188
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,479
that i don't mean there are always

189
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,400
things that you actively choose like you

190
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
know you're dealing with some car

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
accident you just got in through no

192
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
fault of your own okay you didn't choose

193
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
that but you did choose to drive that

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
day you know from meta level these are

195
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
the activities that you do in your life

196
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
as opposed to the activities on the left

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,039
which you can't help but do and which

198
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
uh and which are actually uh

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
higher in priority for the body so

200
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
whatever you decide to do on the right

201
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,319
can be absolutely interrupted at any

202
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
time by the things on the left that your

203
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
body decides is more important than your

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
choices and that's why

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,199
biological time hacking is actually a

206
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
really important place to look

207
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
all of these things have a process in

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
time where you have a warm-up kind of

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
period where you're doing stuff you

210
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,799
might be acquiring matter acquiring

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,919
ingredients um or just focusing on you

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
know you know where are you going to get

213
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
your mindset and so forth and then you

214
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,760
have a process and that process can be

215
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,480
uh digesting food it can be reading the

216
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
book you've decided to read you know

217
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,080
you've gotten the book now you've read

218
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
the book and then there's some kind of

219
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,920
clean up or regroup and then you're

220
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
ready to do the next thing or the same

221
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
thing again uh you put the book down and

222
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
then pick it back up whatever it is so

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
all of these things have a serial time

224
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,959
structure notice this is the arrow of

225
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,920
time

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,399
uh depicted

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,680
let's take a look at breathing for

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
instance first you inhale

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
some gas exchange in your lungs

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
then you exhale

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
okay easy

232
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
uh but let's look a little closer

233
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
because actually there's two processes

234
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,959
there in terms of biology one is that

235
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,959
you need to get oxygen your body

236
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,120
requires oxygen so you're obtaining the

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
oxygen by inhaling

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,399
and then when the

239
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
oxygen is in your lungs it is absorbed

240
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
into the blood and then basically in

241
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
order to

242
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,959
uh obtain more oxygen you now have to

243
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
reset the whole body that includes doing

244
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,600
the

245
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
entire other exhale process but

246
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
basically have to reset your body to be

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
able to inhale again so that's the

248
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
cleanup aspect but concurrently i

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
shouldn't say concurrently but really

250
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
after the inhale portion the reset lungs

251
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
part actually has another processing

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,600
contained which is to get rid of your

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
waste gas so your co2 is again the air

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
is in your lungs it is now uh being

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
exchanged with the blood the carbon

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
dioxide comes out and now you and now

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,079
you have uh gotten rid when you exhale

258
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,959
of the

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,079
co2 but in order to get rid of more co2

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,680
guess what you have to

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
inhale again you have to reset the the

262
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,839
body in in to be able to do that so i

263
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
don't spend too much on that but you get

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
what's what's happening here

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
the main point here is that these

266
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
processes are mutually exclusive you

267
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
cannot inhale while exhaling

268
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
uh and they are serial in time

269
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
so there's no parallelism here you can't

270
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
you there's nothing you can do you just

271
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
simply have to do them one or the other

272
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,880
and you alternate now fortunately for us

273
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
breathing is autonomic we don't have to

274
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
think about it at all so the beautiful

275
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
thing is that we can do breathing in

276
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
parallel with everything else that we do

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
eating and drinking and eliminating that

278
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
which we've consumed is similar process

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
if you think of it that way you obtain

280
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
the matter you have to digest the matter

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
incorporate it into your body and then

282
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
you

283
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
let go of the waste processing same

284
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
thing exactly

285
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,519
this on the other hand

286
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
is a little bit different because

287
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
the

288
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
whereas you have

289
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
essentially one orifice for uh breathing

290
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,959
you have

291
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
other orifices and uh they

292
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
it doesn't enforce a mutual exclusion

293
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
now you could ingest while eliminating

294
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
you know parallelism save a little time

295
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
i guess so there's there's one hack for

296
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,079
you uh

297
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,480
it's not a major one not a major one so

298
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
we'll get to that

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
sleeping is the big one sleeping is the

300
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
big one third of your life spent

301
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
sleeping

302
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
and this is one of those biological

303
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,519
things that we need to do but it

304
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,120
absolutely enforces

305
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
your body not being able to do all those

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,639
other things that you choose unless of

307
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
course you chose to sleep which is fine

308
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
but um

309
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
the prep is you get tired you're sleepy

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
you know you go to sleep then you're in

311
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
your cycles of sleep and then you know

312
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
hours pass there's see here's the rich

313
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,720
treasure trove of time hours are passing

314
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
while you're sleeping and then you spend

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
some time waking up and you know it

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
might be a little groggy or whatever

317
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
okay there's a process

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
this process is actually

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,040
many many processes together some of

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,279
which aren't fully understood we think

321
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,800
that there's a period of time where you

322
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
just relax and unfocus a little bit and

323
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
which is why you can't get to sleep if

324
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,360
you're stressed and thinking about

325
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
something you're not you're still

326
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,639
focused on the thing you need to unfocus

327
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,720
first then you need to unlearn some of

328
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
the irrelevant details from the day so

329
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
your important memories are

330
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,720
remain permanent you can also um you

331
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,519
know

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
rebuild energy in some of your cells

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
that you've expended during the day and

334
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
there's some cellular repair you know

335
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
sleep is really important you need it

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
for repair

337
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
uh and then

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
when you wake up then you're energized

339
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
you're arrested you're attentive and

340
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,839
this is a cyclical thing that happens

341
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,639
once a day but um

342
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
but you can hack that so we'll talk

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
about that

344
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
focusing same thing when you're

345
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
acquiring what you're going to about to

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
be focused on there's a process you know

347
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
like oh where's my pen and where's my

348
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
paper and you know or where are my

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
glasses all these things you have to do

350
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
to sit down to do your task and you do

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
your task and you might be this task

352
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
might be anything

353
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
that you choose to do so there's choice

354
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
but there's biological aspects to this

355
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
if you uh you can do things to increase

356
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
your focus like take things like

357
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,839
caffeine or

358
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,279
l-tyrosine uh and by the way when i say

359
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
these things it's an option for some

360
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
people and maybe not an option for other

361
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
people everyone is different and age

362
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
dependent there's all these reasons why

363
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,560
so you have to do what makes sense for

364
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
you and what you know also

365
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,519
sensitivities to things like caffeine

366
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
for instance are different for for

367
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
people i'm highly acclimated to using

368
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
caffeine so it's no problem for me but

369
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,920
someone who doesn't drink let's say

370
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,399
coffee regularly may not may have may

371
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
have a harder time they may be jittery

372
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
and stuff and then they can't focus it

373
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
might be counter purposes so i'm not

374
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,040
making any recommendation

375
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
uh but i'm just saying there are things

376
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
you can do to

377
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
uh to

378
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
like biologically do to increase your

379
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
ability to focus

380
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
um and then when you put the task down

381
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
you park it and go on to the next thing

382
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
and we'll we'll get into to that that's

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
important um but

384
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
here's a real problem

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
here is a huge time waste during the day

386
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
is context switching you're sitting down

387
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,199
you're doing your task and you are

388
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,320
interrupted

389
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
well you've you've instantly parked what

390
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
you've done to go deal with whatever

391
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
just happened the you know some

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,000
something fell whatever someone came in

393
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
the door your phone rang whatever it is

394
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,959
or you know smart mess smartphone

395
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,040
notifications you looked at it now where

396
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
was i i don't remember

397
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
it can be up to 20 minutes before you

398
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
can then re-acquire all of the things

399
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,040
that you were focusing on to to then

400
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,519
actually do the task again so if you are

401
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,279
reading and you get uninterrupted it

402
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,120
might only be one minute but it could be

403
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
20 minutes before you really have the

404
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,440
mental capacity to pick up where you

405
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,959
left off now where was it again did i

406
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
even read that last paragraph you know

407
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,720
this type of thing 20 minutes so if you

408
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
think about our modern life with all the

409
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,120
interruptions

410
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,519
this is where a lot of it occurs a lot

411
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,759
of it

412
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,440
optimizations are available here too i

413
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
mentioned

414
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
that you can use stimulants

415
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
uh to increase focus and other things

416
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
also you know uh

417
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,079
be well rested

418
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,680
um

419
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
dietary other dietary things you can do

420
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
to increase your focus and talk about

421
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,519
that a little bit later on but

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
essentially uh

423
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
there's two things here one is to

424
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
prevent interruption so that the total

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,639
time the the total time of acquiring

426
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,759
goes down

427
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
in a serial test because you're doing

428
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,240
this

429
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,560
numbers numbers of times even small

430
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
savings is important and then shortening

431
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,839
the total time of the task by being more

432
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
uh more focused or more able to do the

433
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
task so i have other things

434
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,480
to talk about there with

435
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
physical coordination hand-eye

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
coordination you can make yourself more

437
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,880
efficient that way we can talk about

438
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
that at the end

439
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
try to leave i'm going to try to leave a

440
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
bit of time for uh

441
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,000
q a

442
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
the important thing here is serial

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
versus parallel if you have something

444
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
that happens over and over and over

445
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,839
again even shaving a tiny bit of time

446
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,240
off of that uh matters

447
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
so if you think about like um

448
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
like so for instance

449
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,519
i drink a lot of coffee maybe five cups

450
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,120
a day maybe more

451
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,639
but what i realized was that i was

452
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
waiting about two minutes each time

453
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,160
for

454
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
a cup of coffee so that amounts to about

455
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,759
10 minutes a day when you're standing

456
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,360
there waiting for the coffee it's only

457
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,039
two minutes and that is an insidious tax

458
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
because what happens is yeah it's like

459
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
two minutes i'll wait whatever it's fine

460
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,760
but the thing is 10 minutes a day

461
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
300 minutes a month

462
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
now you're talking real time right now

463
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
add that up over remember the big thing

464
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,079
with um all the days of my life that's a

465
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,079
long period of time waiting for coffee

466
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
so i'd rather not do that uh so i would

467
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,039
rather actually shave off a little bit

468
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,400
of time can i make it one minute can i

469
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
make it half a minute i did i'm a device

470
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,240
maker so i made a coffee maker that

471
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
detects my presence and

472
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
starts its routine

473
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
before i get there and so shaved a

474
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
little bit of time and i like that

475
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,559
so

476
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
parallelism is really important if you

477
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
can do two things at the same time like

478
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
if i could do something while i was

479
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,039
venue for the coffee then i wouldn't

480
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
have to do them serially and so i mean

481
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,320
that's just obvious i think so um

482
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
okay we'll get to the next so here are

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
the things that body needs to take in

484
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
oxygen

485
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
nutrients and i'm going to divide this

486
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960
into water and then all the other matter

487
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
and i do that because

488
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
matter actually is a little bit harder

489
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
to take in and takes a little bit more

490
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
cognitive load than drinking liquids

491
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
and that's going to be an important

492
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
hack

493
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,400
light

494
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
super important

495
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,039
might not even realize this because we

496
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
don't even talk about it anymore because

497
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
we have light whenever we want it on

498
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
demand night or day it doesn't matter

499
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
but the body is really really really

500
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
sensitive to light

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,960
and

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
the fortunate thing is

503
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
light is on demand we can control it if

504
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
we want to and so this is where a lot of

505
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
the big hacking is because your body

506
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
responds to light in different ways and

507
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
i'm i think you've probably heard a lot

508
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
about this with circadian rhythm and

509
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
blue blocking glasses and

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
you know in the literature but um i'll

511
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
tell you exactly what it's about

512
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
because this is where you can achieve

513
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,160
most of the time

514
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
and then information

515
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
information is very important to keep

516
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
the mind going and

517
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
and all the biology around the brain

518
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
going and when i see information it

519
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
actually goes right back to light

520
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
because

521
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
the brain is the thing that takes up the

522
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,640
most of the human body's energy and the

523
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
visual cortex of the brain is is the

524
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,039
piece of the brain that takes up the

525
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,640
even more i mean or not even more but

526
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,799
the the lion's share of all that because

527
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,880
it's processing so much information

528
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
so let's take a look versus time spent

529
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
oxygen breathing great we already

530
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
established breathing is highly

531
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,480
parallelized we don't even think about

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
it so great nothing to think about there

533
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
uh

534
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,880
with water with drinking you can take a

535
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
sip of something you're jogging you're

536
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
biking whatever reading a book you take

537
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,200
a sip you don't even think about it it's

538
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
fairly parallelized you do have to

539
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
obtain the liquid at some point and you

540
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
know set it up and whatever fine

541
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,559
try to shorten that time

542
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,200
eating a lot harder a lot harder you

543
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,799
have to correlate a lot of different

544
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,400
things and then if you couple it with a

545
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,480
social interaction then you have to

546
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
manage other people's schedules and then

547
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
there's ordering and or you know or

548
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
cooking or whatever it is that you're

549
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,480
trying to do it's going to take some

550
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,799
time however that might be what you

551
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
might want to spend your time on so

552
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
please do but then you can maybe you

553
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,240
want to maximize the amount of time that

554
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
you spend eating because you get this

555
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
double benefit now you're parallelizing

556
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,159
might be socializing but you also might

557
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
be getting nutrients

558
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
light everything we do right we're

559
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,080
always

560
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,400
bathed in light even at night

561
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
there's light there's some kind of light

562
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
either

563
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
all kinds of lights actually we'll get

564
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,159
into that actually

565
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,720
uh and information also everything

566
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
so

567
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
this is where the hacking comes in

568
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,280
because you can

569
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
since everything is is impinging upon

570
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
this any change you make to almost

571
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
anything

572
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
can help you here

573
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,440
so this is called the circadian rhythm

574
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,960
circa means approximately uh diem is day

575
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
so about a day so this cycle is about a

576
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,640
day about a day long and definitely your

577
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
biological organism has this rhythm it

578
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
definitely does things and it does and

579
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
it's um

580
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
it happens by light entrainment so we we

581
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,799
just we are

582
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
biological organisms as are many other

583
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
animals that uh

584
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
uh follow this cycle uh they might do

585
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
different things during this cycle but

586
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,039
the light dark light dark of day night

587
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,720
day night is actually extremely

588
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
important and totally totally baked into

589
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,159
our body and our organism and our brain

590
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,679
brain also part of the body just to be

591
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
clear so highly biological

592
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
um this is a very interesting graphic

593
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
because

594
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,760
it really shows you that there are real

595
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
really different spots during the day so

596
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,200
for instance in the when you after you

597
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
wake up and you are awake

598
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,799
that's the period of time when you have

599
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,240
the most energy because you haven't

600
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
spent it yet you just spent all this

601
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,159
time sleeping and so this is a great

602
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,640
time for cognitive tasks high alertness

603
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
you can see and then you might so you

604
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
might want to choose tasks that you're

605
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
going to do or want to do that couple

606
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
with this type of activity in the

607
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,520
morning

608
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
and then in the afternoon you have much

609
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
more cardiovascular efficiency but maybe

610
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
you have less analytical ability at that

611
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
time so you might want to choose tasks

612
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
that

613
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
map to that better during the afternoon

614
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
and that that's working with your cycle

615
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
and i just want to say that this is a

616
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
even though it says midnight and noon

617
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,679
that's really a throwback in a way to

618
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
our roots which is that yes it used to

619
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,240
be midnight and noon but

620
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
we have rooms where we can block the

621
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
shades you know block the sun out and

622
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
put on any kinds of light that we want

623
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
and um

624
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,679
and therefore it doesn't have to be

625
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
doesn't have to be uh

626
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
uh

627
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,360
mapped to daylight it could be mapped to

628
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,640
our artificial control of light but

629
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
here's the problem modern life uh

630
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,720
has us having very dim days and very

631
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
bright comparatively bright nights

632
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,039
compared to the natural darkness of real

633
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,240
night

634
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
even with the moon

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
so

636
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,159
look around you

637
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
this is a kind of a dim room if you

638
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,919
think of how bright it is outside i mean

639
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
even on a cloudy day it might be

640
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
20 000 lux as a unit of measurement and

641
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,000
in here it might only be 200.

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,480
one percent five percent you know you

643
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
turn the lights up a little and it's

644
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,799
five percent but it's never almost never

645
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,080
ten percent of what you're going to get

646
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
outside but guess what our biology

647
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
expects it to be really bright

648
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
there are cheats around this so we'll

649
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
get to that

650
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
but at night

651
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
we have all kinds of overhead lights

652
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
we've got screens and we've got phones

653
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,840
television all kinds of things that are

654
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,559
uh that are basically illuminating us at

655
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,400
times when we when our body does not

656
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,960
expect it and it has real uh real

657
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
consequences with our

658
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
sleep schedule

659
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,720
the human eye is the organ that actually

660
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
is coordinating this light information

661
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
even when the eyelids are closed

662
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
especially red light can penetrate

663
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,559
through the eyelids and get to the

664
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
retinas

665
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,480
and

666
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
even though the skin for instance is

667
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
light sensitive you obviously can go get

668
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
a tan so your this giant organ of the

669
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
skin is responding to light it is

670
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
photosensitive uh and there are things

671
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
that you that you get from that vitamin

672
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
d and stuff like this that vitamin d

673
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
affects um

674
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
it's really the eye

675
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
that gives you this chronology

676
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,760
information not the skin

677
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,480
so managing your eyesight and what

678
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,919
you're looking at and what types of

679
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
lights you take into your eye directly

680
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
or indirectly because it's not about

681
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,600
image recognition it's not about

682
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,640
focusing and seeing something clearly

683
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,559
it's actually just about what photons

684
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,320
are hitting the receptors in your retina

685
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
focused or unfocused

686
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
there's your retina and

687
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,960
in this retina are a few different kinds

688
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
of photoreceptors

689
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
you may have all heard of rods and cones

690
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
rods are the things that basically

691
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
perceive brightness and cones are the

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,000
things that basically perceive color i

693
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,679
can get into the mechanism of that if

694
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,960
you like later

695
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,039
but then this is other one that you

696
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,240
probably haven't heard of which are the

697
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,320
iprgcs that's there that stands for uh

698
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,799
intrinsically photosensitive retinal

699
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
ganglion cells so too bad they didn't

700
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
come up with a really short name like

701
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,720
rods and cones so i could talk about it

702
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,520
but these are the receptors that exist

703
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
that do not

704
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
support

705
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,440
optical vision you don't see anything

706
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
you don't it doesn't produce an image in

707
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
your mind but what it does do is it

708
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,080
tells the brain what time of day it is

709
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
what time of day your body thinks it is

710
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,520
here are the rods uh i'm sorry the cones

711
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
the color cones there's three types and

712
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,679
this is the color spectra that they can

713
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,720
absorb

714
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
you might notice there's a giant gap

715
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,720
there in the blue region

716
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
but basically mixing these three colors

717
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,840
gets you the i can see about 10 million

718
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
separate colors about which is

719
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
interesting because most of our screens

720
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
can do 16 million but

721
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
can't see all of the differences at the

722
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,799
lowest levels of resolution or the

723
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,960
highest levels

724
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,039
but this is a photo pigment called

725
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,120
melanopsin and that's the thing that is

726
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,520
absorbing light in a different uh

727
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
frequency range so if you take a look

728
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,919
here the melanopsin curve is in between

729
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,720
the s cone and the m cone and that is

730
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,039
the thing that is the blue light that

731
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
everyone thinks is so bad that that you

732
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
need to wear blockers for the truth is

733
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
and by the way that's at approximately

734
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
peaks at around 480 nanometers

735
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,200
wavelength it goes from about 464 to 482

736
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
uh in the literature

737
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
there isn't i mean there's probably just

738
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,720
variation as well

739
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,600
um

740
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,480
but this is the area where

741
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,840
your body is

742
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
understanding that it's daytime and you

743
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
should do things like

744
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
secrete melatonin or suppress melatonin

745
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
secretion you are able to become sleepy

746
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,279
or become very alert

747
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,840
adenosine in your body also a cruise

748
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,320
when you're sleeping uh and

749
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,919
when you're awake uh it it gets depleted

750
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,360
uh actually there's an interesting thing

751
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
about this uh caffeine is an adenosine

752
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,440
antagonist and so what that means is it

753
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,399
will

754
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,840
prevent you

755
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
from prevent the adenosine from doing

756
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,919
its sleepiness trick on you and that's

757
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,240
why you can stay awake if you just keep

758
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
drinking the coffee

759
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,120
you that adenosine is not free to make

760
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,000
you sleepy the moment the caffeine wears

761
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
off and is metabolized all of a sudden

762
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,840
all the excess adenosine is there and

763
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
now all of a sudden you have that 3 pm

764
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,760
afternoon crash that's what it's about

765
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,399
so understanding these mechanisms and

766
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,240
and mixing them with the use of the

767
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,679
correct use of light uh is a great way

768
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
to uh find more time because when i'm

769
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,320
crashed out in three in the afternoon i

770
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
can't do anything that i choose it's

771
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,000
really my biology saying you can't do

772
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
anything else now your adenosine has

773
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,120
taken over

774
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
so

775
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,440
this blue light is uh being absorbed by

776
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,279
the melanopsin and

777
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,440
being converted into circadian

778
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,360
information for the brain

779
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
and it's the thing that tells you to be

780
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,039
alert

781
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,240
so

782
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,399
in the morning you actually really do

783
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,320
want blue light

784
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,559
and if you have bright blue light not

785
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,080
200 lux but 20 000 lux you will be

786
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
quite alert and it's a purely biological

787
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,600
effect

788
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,080
but you can use it you can intentionally

789
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
have a seasonal affected disorder lamp

790
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,320
that produces 10 000 lux

791
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,440
and

792
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
and

793
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,840
have a better mood higher focus but just

794
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
general alertness and attentiveness and

795
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,840
be more efficient about your day and

796
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,760
your tasks will go faster as well

797
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,440
at night however

798
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
you don't want to get excited by this

799
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
blue light and that's where the blue

800
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,120
blockers come in and the night vision on

801
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,799
your computer and on your phone if you

802
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,919
have that

803
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,679
it's very good to use those things

804
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,200
because you don't want to trigger your

805
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,279
body to say hey is it daylight maybe i

806
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,880
should wake up and then that makes your

807
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,559
sleep less efficient and then you might

808
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,559
need more cycles of sleep

809
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,880
to get the energy restoration that you

810
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
need

811
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,120
so this sleep and light is what's called

812
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
a zeitgeber that's uh from the german

813
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
and means literally time giver and

814
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,799
originally it was used as uh i'm going

815
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,559
to give you the time like a metronome

816
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,320
and the sun going up and down is the

817
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,480
metronome beat for your body but i like

818
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,159
to think of it as the time giver it's

819
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,480
the thing the technique that allows to

820
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
give you time

821
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,720
um and so we're back to this cycle you

822
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
can see uh you can tweak this quite a

823
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,399
bit if you if you extend certain periods

824
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,520
using the correct light

825
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600
but we'll talk exactly about it

826
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
um i just want to show you this there's

827
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,200
uh data that show that some people are

828
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,559
really differently sensitive to um

829
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,840
light than others uh could be 50 times

830
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
difference so

831
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
you might be extremely sensitive to

832
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,240
sunlight or just light in general and

833
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,559
there may be a great effect or you might

834
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,120
be able to be relatively insensitive to

835
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
light so not all these techniques are

836
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
going to work for everyone and the

837
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
amount of light you might need to

838
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,399
trigger one of these things might be

839
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,480
more or less depending on your own

840
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
biology

841
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,440
your individual biology

842
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,799
now

843
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,880
here's where

844
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,720
uh cutting up your time into manageable

845
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,679
modular sections is going to help you

846
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
90 minutes 90 minutes is your friend

847
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,320
that's that's the time period you should

848
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
think about

849
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
it governs a lot of processes in the

850
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
body the first one i'm going to talk

851
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
about is sleep

852
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,279
here is one sleep cycle

853
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
what happens here is you

854
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,279
are awake you're awake that's the w and

855
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,159
then you

856
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,640
get into certain levels of sleep use r

857
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,120
is um rapid eye movement sleep it's

858
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,760
where a lot of stuff happens uh but you

859
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
really skip it when you go to sleep in

860
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
the initial portions of sleep and that

861
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,480
that's really important to understand

862
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,840
because if you don't spend 90 minutes

863
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,159
sleeping you take a 15 minute power nap

864
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,480
they're very good there's ways to do it

865
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,840
uh

866
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,919
such as drink a cup of coffee right

867
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
before sleeping and then before it kicks

868
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
in you can then sleep and get your

869
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,480
energy restoration but then the caffeine

870
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,960
kicks in and will wake you up prior to

871
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
getting to that so if you only have time

872
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
for a very small amount of energy

873
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,120
restoration

874
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
that's a technique you can use and i

875
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,720
think that's called the japanese coffee

876
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,559
nap i think they invented it but

877
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,240
i did not invent it but i use it and it

878
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,720
works but the key thing here is that

879
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,640
this does not interrupt the circadian

880
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
cycle because you don't ever get to that

881
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
uh rapid eye movement sleep at the end

882
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
because you've interrupted it before 90

883
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
minutes however if you sleep for 90

884
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,679
minutes you can actually get to this

885
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,399
spot

886
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,279
and

887
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,120
not have to sleep

888
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,559
as much

889
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,640
at night in a big sleep because you've

890
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,840
already done some of this work

891
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,960
here's a

892
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
hours of sleep overnight

893
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
seven eight nine hours you know it

894
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,440
varies and the cycle time varies but by

895
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
the way when i said 90 minutes it's not

896
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,200
exactly 90 minutes it's about 90 minutes

897
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
so it depends it's going to depend on

898
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,000
you it's going to depend on a variety of

899
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
things including like what you ate and

900
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,559
how much you know metabolism you you've

901
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
got this type of thing so there's some

902
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,679
variants but 90 minutes is the

903
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
approximate gauge

904
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
what's interesting here is that there

905
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,600
are many of these 90-minute cycles

906
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
during sleep and

907
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,120
my hack i'm just going to just tell you

908
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,519
right right now is to understand

909
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,000
how many of these things

910
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,559
you have and then when you're close to

911
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,000
wakefulness you can see in the middle of

912
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,760
this chart you're actually awake a

913
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
little bit you might not remember it

914
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
because you know you wake up and oh

915
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
nothing and you go right back to sleep

916
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,480
you spend almost no time awake but that

917
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,640
is your opportunity right there

918
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,519
to

919
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,080
actually just wake up if you want to and

920
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
there's ways to do that which we'll talk

921
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,799
about

922
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,559
and then you can sleep a lot less but

923
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,399
anyway the point is you're controlling

924
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,880
your sleep but don't try to wake up at

925
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,159
you know 120 minutes in it really has to

926
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559
be a multiple of around 90 minutes and

927
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,320
you can tune that in for yourself as you

928
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,279
as you figure yourself out

929
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,200
so yeah

930
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
approximately third of your life

931
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,519
just sleeping you can't do anything

932
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,120
while you're sleeping

933
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
or can you

934
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,679
well

935
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,279
there are opportunities for parallelism

936
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,840
during sleep

937
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,519
so of all those things that i mentioned

938
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
you probably can't do things like your

939
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
hobbies or any of that stuff but

940
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,440
there are some things you can do you can

941
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
actually um

942
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,279
go to the bathroom while you're sleeping

943
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,000
and when i say that i i mean like not

944
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,120
you know while you're in bed but like

945
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
you your natural body processes wake you

946
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
up at one of those 90-minute cycles when

947
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,960
you're near wakefulness and your body

948
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,559
says hey you know i gotta go and so what

949
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,360
do you do it depends but you you go

950
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
right uh and you go back to sleep it's

951
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,559
not a big not a big problem but the

952
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,560
thing is that occurred while you were

953
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,679
sleeping

954
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,800
and

955
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
yes you were awake while you were asleep

956
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,320
while you were in that sleep cycle so

957
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,239
it's a maybe a technical difference but

958
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,079
essentially during your big sleep cycle

959
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,918
you could do that and so you already

960
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,359
know that you can do that but the thing

961
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,199
that you shouldn't do is turn on the

962
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,719
overhead lights to see where you're

963
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
walking to because that's the thing that

964
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,239
triggers a circadian system and then the

965
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,918
rest of your sleep is kind of like not

966
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,199
as good and not as efficient and then

967
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,599
you will need more sleep but if you have

968
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,560
a nice

969
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,760
red light in the in if i i'll show you

970
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,599
later but a 650 nanometer red wavelength

971
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,839
and above it doesn't trigger any of that

972
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,639
blue stuff or any of the uh also there's

973
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,960
other frequencies where it's just um

974
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
brightness that can trigger the

975
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
circadian system but if you have a red

976
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
light at night and is bright you can

977
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,119
actually see because your red

978
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,599
absorbing cones can absolutely make a

979
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
visual image you can see everything and

980
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
it's bright and it's red but your

981
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,240
melanopsin your iprgcs that are

982
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,839
translating that into the circadian

983
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,880
rhythm

984
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
don't see it at all absolutely invisible

985
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,240
so it does not wake you up it keeps your

986
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,000
sleep efficient you can keep it short

987
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,160
and now guess what you're awake while

988
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
you're asleep so you can do certain

989
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,520
things

990
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
i found i tried to eat while i was

991
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
sleeping i tried to drink while i was

992
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
sleeping i had a very hard time with

993
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,520
eating because it's very cognitive

994
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,240
cognitively difficult to do these things

995
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,599
and also food is another diet gaber we

996
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
tend to feed while we're awake and in

997
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,200
the daytime and that tells the body when

998
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
you're eating something it tells the

999
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,960
body oh time to wake up so i found out

1000
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,560
that chewing things and creating a

1001
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
salivary response

1002
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,720
not good that doesn't work at all but

1003
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,400
you can drink stuff

1004
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
it just goes down doesn't matter and if

1005
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,400
you have water you can add a little

1006
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,240
sugar you can add a little protein as

1007
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
long as it's tasteless and doesn't have

1008
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,160
kind of uh you know a triggering effect

1009
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,280
for the brain

1010
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,119
uh i mean that works for me may not work

1011
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,760
for everybody but you can have something

1012
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,520
and if you do that then when you wake up

1013
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
guess what you're less hungry you might

1014
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,560
be able to skip breakfast which i do all

1015
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,680
the time and i don't think it's

1016
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
unhealthy to do so i eat lunch it's okay

1017
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,640
so uh and it's pl it's sufficient but in

1018
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
other words i've just freed up all that

1019
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,000
time to do something else focus on

1020
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
something

1021
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
there are opportunities for fewer sleep

1022
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,000
cycles because if you do it this way and

1023
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,560
you're efficient at going to sleep and

1024
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,520
uh and and getting up and then

1025
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,839
and then you are aware of your body's

1026
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,000
propensity to wake up

1027
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
in the middle of your in the middle of

1028
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,119
the long sleep at the wakefulness

1029
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,520
periods uh you can actually interrupt

1030
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
intentionally interrupt yourself there

1031
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
one way to do that is by doing the thing

1032
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,920
i just said which is drinking some stuff

1033
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,079
if you drink a lot of stuff your body is

1034
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
going to want to make you get up and so

1035
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,079
when you're up if you realize that you

1036
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,760
are up because you've gone to eliminate

1037
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,560
you can just stay up because you're

1038
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
if you've timed it right you've had

1039
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
enough sleep at that point and you can

1040
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
always choose to have a another mini

1041
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,599
sleep that's more than 90 minutes nine

1042
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,520
minutes or more uh

1043
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,440
later on in the day if you like

1044
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
it's up to you to however you like to

1045
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,160
optimize it's not always convenient to

1046
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
take a nap so

1047
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,520
but you can definitely do with less

1048
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,160
sleep or i can i should say rephrase i

1049
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,599
can do it leslie

1050
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,440
might be different for you

1051
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,040
um and then there are opportunities with

1052
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
sleep to increase the serial efficiency

1053
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,079
so uh i don't use blue blue lights in

1054
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,720
that in that uh uh period of time before

1055
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,839
going to sleep and therefore i can sleep

1056
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
very fast i don't i don't i also use

1057
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
some mental techniques to

1058
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,800
really not stress out and you know just

1059
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,920
try to

1060
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,839
go to sleep quickly

1061
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,680
and i can probably sleep in less than

1062
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,320
two minutes uh so all that so instead of

1063
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,040
like

1064
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,200
you know all of these uh you know

1065
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,720
all this time spent you know we're

1066
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,760
thinking about the day or just

1067
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,200
intentionally

1068
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,280
don't do that try to really you know

1069
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,760
have a nice meal relax start unfocusing

1070
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,079
ahead of time don't use any blue lights

1071
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:06,960
and

1072
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,240
and you the sleep pressure you your body

1073
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,720
naturally has because the melatonin has

1074
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,359
started to build up already will allow

1075
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
you to fall right asleep and so that

1076
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,359
becomes very efficient and then when you

1077
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,920
wake up you can use a blue light and

1078
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,599
that will

1079
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,680
more quickly bring you into alertness

1080
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,119
but guess what there's another thing you

1081
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,760
can do you can use the lights before you

1082
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,839
wake up i told you the eyelids

1083
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,079
translucent right the light goes in so

1084
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,800
what happens is if you if you can build

1085
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,520
a device that has a timer on it or or

1086
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
get one and start

1087
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
illuminating your room that you're

1088
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,440
sleeping in prior to you waking up the

1089
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,040
body will actually

1090
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,720
register this while you're sleeping so

1091
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,800
now you're waking while you're sleeping

1092
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
and so when you actually do get fully

1093
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,520
awake you are much more alert than when

1094
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,800
you were and then you can just go about

1095
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,839
your day you have to spend all that

1096
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,000
time becoming awake and i suggest that

1097
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
you actually delay caffeine

1098
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,040
once you wake up

1099
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,240
sometimes you wake up and you want to

1100
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,359
just get that coffee to get that

1101
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,280
attentiveness it's true but remember

1102
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
what i said about it being an adenosine

1103
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,160
antagonist that'll bite you later

1104
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,920
if you let the adenosine clear out for a

1105
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,520
little bit before you get that cup of

1106
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
coffee you're going to do better over

1107
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,079
the course of the day

1108
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,520
just back to this i want to show you you

1109
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,440
know you can try to interrupt at the

1110
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,520
different times uh and

1111
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,400
you have to see what works for you

1112
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
okay remember this

1113
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,359
focus

1114
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,480
focusing

1115
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,720
uh you can't focus on stuff for really

1116
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,359
more than 90 minutes just biologically

1117
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,079
sure

1118
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,599
you can thank you i focused on that all

1119
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,359
day long well not really you actually

1120
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,680
focused it on for 90 minutes max and

1121
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,119
then

1122
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,480
your body just can't because the

1123
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
chemicals in your body the dopamine

1124
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,680
and other things that you you have uh

1125
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,760
in your body while you're focusing just

1126
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,640
get depleted you need to relax after 90

1127
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
90 minutes so if you know this

1128
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
that's great

1129
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
don't schedule a task you think is you

1130
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,119
really need super focus for for you know

1131
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,760
three hours it's just not going to work

1132
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
you can chop it into two hour and a half

1133
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
blocks and then put something in between

1134
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,839
that allows you to replenish maybe a 15

1135
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,680
minute japanese coffee nap or something

1136
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,560
else

1137
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
so food again i mentioned to you it's a

1138
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
zeitgeber it tells you uh it tells you

1139
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,920
when uh along with light went what time

1140
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
of day it is and what your body ought to

1141
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,119
be doing but it's totally necessary

1142
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,640
obviously we need to have energy and

1143
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,280
this is how we derive it

1144
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
so yes it's a zeitgeber so be careful

1145
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,680
when you're using food

1146
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,920
with respect to the sleep cycle you want

1147
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,160
to have because they can run counter to

1148
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,680
each other or they can run together with

1149
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,839
each other and and so it's just about

1150
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,000
whatever purpose you want if you want to

1151
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,319
eat less or sleep less or eat more sleep

1152
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,240
more you can combine these things in a

1153
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
particular way

1154
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,119
and then

1155
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,800
there's caffeine for you

1156
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,160
there's uh caffeine and other stimulants

1157
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,000
and other substances like l-tyrosine are

1158
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
great for focus so you can do things

1159
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,520
quickly

1160
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
more quickly saving time i want to tell

1161
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,200
you one other thing that i do when i

1162
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,680
wake up is that i spend three minutes i

1163
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
know three minutes it's a long time

1164
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,680
every day right but i spend three

1165
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,560
minutes

1166
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,079
uh and i shine uh

1167
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,359
660 nanometer red and 860 nanometer red

1168
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,280
infrared light uh

1169
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,119
in the room not directly into my eyes

1170
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,880
but indirectly because i don't focus

1171
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
focus light on my eyes but uh i'm

1172
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,880
older so i um my

1173
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,119
retinal cells are not as

1174
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,079
uh

1175
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,640
efficient at creating energy as they

1176
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
used to be when i was younger

1177
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,560
and it turns out that there was there's

1178
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,720
some studies that show this that if you

1179
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,040
just have three minutes of red and

1180
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,319
infrared exposure to your retinas the uh

1181
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,640
your eyesight will improve because those

1182
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,520
cells that are really

1183
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
you know responsible for converting all

1184
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,760
this huge amount of information into

1185
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
brain information right

1186
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,040
light information into brain information

1187
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,440
for you uh it just has more energy so

1188
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,920
your visual acuity increases and i do

1189
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,359
that because my

1190
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,400
work is really highly visual all the

1191
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,440
time

1192
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
small wires circuits or all kinds of

1193
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,359
things code whatever i have to see

1194
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,319
and

1195
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,960
constantly using my eyes and so for me i

1196
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,079
believe that those three minutes per day

1197
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
translate to uh time savings of many

1198
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,119
more than three minutes per day because

1199
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,560
i'm not um

1200
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,640
because i can see and i when i first had

1201
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,560
to start to wear glasses it was a real

1202
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
time cost for me where where my glasses

1203
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
go you know i

1204
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,400
lose them on my lab table where i have

1205
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,119
to find them horrible time costs

1206
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,920
but

1207
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,119
visual acuity and focus uh

1208
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,359
helps me to focus also by the way

1209
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,119
if you it's a biological fact that if

1210
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,839
you have your hands in your view you can

1211
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,200
focus on the thing you're working on

1212
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
more that's just a hand-eye coordination

1213
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,720
thing it's wired into our brains so

1214
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
that's another biological thing if your

1215
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,079
hands are not in your view and you have

1216
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,520
that kind of work

1217
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,800
i don't know maybe you can try putting

1218
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,319
your hands in your view

1219
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,119
and it might stimulate more focus

1220
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,599
okay so main points increase parallelism

1221
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,839
of these actions make tiny improvements

1222
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,599
to the highly repeated serial actions

1223
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
maybe not the not highly repeated ones

1224
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,680
but certainly the highly repeated ones

1225
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,920
make small improvements and you'll buy

1226
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,440
you some time

1227
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
definitely use biology instead of

1228
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,119
decision making biology is always going

1229
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,599
to win no matter what you choose to do

1230
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,359
your body will say you can't do this now

1231
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,760
or you must do this now so more you

1232
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,839
tweak your biology the more success you

1233
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,359
will have at

1234
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,200
actually achieving these things again

1235
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,319
you can use organizational and

1236
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,000
psychological methods

1237
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,480
we can talk about that another time

1238
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,599
and understand which things work

1239
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,560
together

1240
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,079
which things work against each other in

1241
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,319
opposition you can use the opposition

1242
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,200
but you can also maximize the

1243
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,919
the synchrony

1244
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,079
just remember this cycle it's really

1245
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,960
important and you can tweak it

1246
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,839
okay so these are the minutes of my talk

1247
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,119
here we are now

1248
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,720
there's a few minutes now for questions

1249
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,800
and then the green represents the future

1250
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
with which is what you'll whatever

1251
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,599
you'll do with this information i've

1252
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,040
given you thank you very much

1253
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,440
if you have any questions for our

1254
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,200
speaker please come over to the

1255
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,319
microphone so that everyone watching

1256
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,759
online can also hear your questions

1257
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,079
no no please

1258
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,880
this is what i've chosen to do today

1259
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,160
uh so um my wife is a sleep doctor so

1260
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
i've been taking lots of photos of your

1261
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,359
slides and she's been getting kicked a

1262
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,040
kick out of your talk

1263
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,720
uh one thing and

1264
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,319
there was nothing she disagreed with so

1265
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,599
uh but uh

1266
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,599
but one if you go back one slide to the

1267
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,319
circadian rhythm yes this one she would

1268
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,400
like to draw the attention that if you

1269
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,200
notice there's times associated to the

1270
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,079
and rhythm yes which is artificial

1271
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,920
and humans

1272
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,839
dictate those numbers

1273
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
and we live in a society

1274
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
in which uh

1275
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
we have to inter face with people and

1276
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
what time they want to interface we have

1277
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,760
to comply with a lot

1278
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,160
there's an effort going on politically

1279
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,000
to get rid of daylight savings time

1280
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,040
which is fine but the big question is

1281
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,960
will be permanent daylight savings time

1282
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,200
or standard permanent standard time

1283
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,960
permanent standard time more lines to

1284
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,480
your circadian rhythm

1285
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,839
so she would like you to go to the

1286
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,880
website save standard time oh shoot

1287
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,400
either dot com or dot org i can't

1288
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,319
remember which so it's on my phone i

1289
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,920
might think about it anyway so sorry

1290
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,880
about that

1291
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,680
but uh uh that is an important point

1292
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,319
that uh daily savings time and the

1293
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,480
artificial numbers that we put on

1294
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,040
the circadian rhythm affects us uh

1295
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,280
personally so sorry about i don't know

1296
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,359
absolutely i agree i agree it's totally

1297
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,680
made up um and

1298
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,599
uh but the the thing on this chart is

1299
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,359
that it actually goes from midnight to

1300
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,040
noon and that's not made up because

1301
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,800
that's you know the words are made up

1302
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,240
but the fact that the sun is up versus

1303
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,760
sun is down that's the thing that's

1304
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,000
that's around this the numbers they are

1305
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,680
whatever they are i know that there was

1306
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,400
a

1307
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,280
a an attempt to go to decimal time in

1308
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
france in the 1800s or something so

1309
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,200
that's just totally made up not really

1310
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,280
worried so much about clock time as as

1311
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680
opposed to where you are in your cycle

1312
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,960
and there's also something i didn't talk

1313
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
about which is by phasic sleep which is

1314
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,359
something that i've tried uh it's where

1315
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,920
you again interrupt your your sleep

1316
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,800
cycles uh on one of the 90-minute

1317
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
portions and sleep a lot less but then

1318
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,560
try to do it more often during the day

1319
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,359
and i had some success with that um but

1320
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,920
it's really inconvenient to take the you

1321
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
know the other the small nap the small

1322
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,880
sleep there's the big sleep and the

1323
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
small sleep it's inconvenient to do it

1324
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,760
um

1325
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,839
in general but i found a way and the way

1326
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,720
was actually to go to metric time

1327
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,920
a hundred thousand seconds worth of day

1328
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
of my cycle

1329
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,520
in other words really um

1330
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,599
a little bit more than 27 hours was now

1331
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,839
the cycle for me and i had to figure out

1332
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,920
how to precess it so that sleep didn't

1333
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
occur during business hours so then i

1334
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,200
was sleeping on the weekends and that

1335
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
was okay because then i could do more

1336
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,040
stuff at night but uh very very

1337
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,280
inconvenient to deal with socially so i

1338
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,240
absolutely agree i don't do it anymore

1339
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,319
because i think i'm probably just as

1340
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,400
efficient now after honing

1341
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,760
some of the

1342
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,920
coffee and light techniques that i use

1343
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,559
so yeah totally made up and you should

1344
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,119
make it up for yourself

1345
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,040
yes related to the light i have an

1346
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,520
online question from sean leblanc

1347
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,359
what do you use to get those three

1348
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,680
minutes of that type of light

1349
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,720
you can just use a any red light therapy

1350
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,960
lamp that's available on amazon

1351
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,839
just look for 616 nanometers and 860

1352
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,800
nanometers uh try not to use highly

1353
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480
intense lights that shine directly into

1354
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,599
your light but

1355
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,440
it just just has to fall on your retinas

1356
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,000
that's it

1357
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,200
so is a 90-minute nap the best like

1358
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,920
during the day for us busy workers and

1359
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,640
maybe an eight-hour sleep or more at

1360
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,760
night or is there any value to a ten or

1361
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,240
a five-minute nap or such thing even

1362
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,160
possible

1363
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,359
um

1364
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,599
i can't speak to what's best because

1365
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,160
it's going to depend on your goals right

1366
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,359
i don't want to spend all my life

1367
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,680
sleeping or one-third of it sleeping i

1368
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,079
can settle for a quarter or a fifth or

1369
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,079
something like this so at least moving

1370
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,119
forward

1371
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,839
so i uh think that a

1372
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,720
90-minute nap can work if you're you get

1373
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,400
to that rapid eye movement

1374
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,319
stage and then you have techniques to

1375
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,119
then become attentive very quickly go to

1376
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,880
sleep quickly have that 90 minutes

1377
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
become attentive very quickly and um but

1378
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,119
i find that that's kind of hard to time

1379
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,440
so the five minute nap or the 10 minute

1380
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,040
nap as you said of course possible

1381
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,640
because if you're if you've trained your

1382
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,200
body to become very uh efficient at

1383
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,880
going to sleep you can absolutely do

1384
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,040
that and if i and then the trick is

1385
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,520
waking up how do you wake up after uh

1386
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,680
five or ten minutes so i tend not to use

1387
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,040
alarms because i don't want to interrupt

1388
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,880
my body from doing the thing that it's

1389
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
doing i want that five minutes that 10

1390
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,040
minutes to really be worthwhile so i'll

1391
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,240
do something like i mentioned to you

1392
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
before i'll drink a cup of coffee right

1393
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,280
before going to sleep and before it

1394
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
before it kicks in i'm asleep but then

1395
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,240
it kicks in and then i'm awake and then

1396
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,319
it's 15 minutes it works really well and

1397
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,160
you get a lot of you gotta you get a lot

1398
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,760
of uh

1399
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
the benefits of actual sleep out of it

1400
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,240
but not the rapid eye movement phase

1401
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,839
so then you'll have to go get that and

1402
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,359
you'll do that at the big sleep later

1403
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,800
but you can keep that big sleep down to

1404
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
six hours potentially four and a half

1405
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,000
hours

1406
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,680
so that's the benefit that's the hack

1407
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,800
there

1408
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,559
you're welcome

1409
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,640
yeah i i can attest to the 10 to 15

1410
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,200
minute nap really working for me

1411
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
um and i i kind of go to sleep long

1412
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,480
enough to wake up

1413
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,040
and that works um so you talked about

1414
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,880
what is it the blue light uh before you

1415
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,760
wake up yes um so

1416
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,720
um

1417
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,040
was that ten minutes before

1418
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,200
i start about 30 minutes 30 minutes 30

1419
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,559
minutes before i have this idea of

1420
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,960
making an alarm that will do that first

1421
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,599
um so what about exercise

1422
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,280
in the morning

1423
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,000
so exercise is is great it consumes

1424
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,480
energy but it also it also does a lot

1425
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,680
for um

1426
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,079
uh you know getting your blood flowing

1427
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,599
and your your breath and so there's a

1428
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,440
lot there's a lot more throughput of

1429
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,119
chemical activity going on when you

1430
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,440
exercise and there's a dopamine this

1431
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,200
dopamine response so you definitely feel

1432
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,280
more alert afterwards i think it's a

1433
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,800
great thing if you want to do that i

1434
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
don't like to do it in the morning

1435
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,480
because i want to spend my time that

1436
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,359
time uh with analytical tasks and not

1437
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,520
cardiovascular tasks so i tend to do it

1438
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
in the afternoon so it's it's really

1439
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,280
about what you want out of it if you

1440
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,680
think that you can benefit from um the

1441
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,760
high alertness that you get from uh hard

1442
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,240
physical exercise and by the way we're

1443
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,520
not talking about like the health

1444
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,839
benefits from from health from you know

1445
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,520
hard exercise there's that too but i'm

1446
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,559
talking about that i'm talking about

1447
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,960
just i'm alert now and i feel great and

1448
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,200
my body chemicals are all in swing

1449
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
and now i can do the thing i choose to

1450
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,119
do because it

1451
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,760
that maps very well to that then then

1452
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,720
you should do that whenever you want

1453
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,880
like in the morning

1454
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,160
i i find that for me uh you know i tend

1455
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,240
to do that more in the afternoon and

1456
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,800
that works for me um sorry to answer

1457
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,640
your question

1458
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,960
and one last question from the matrix

1459
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,599
chat from ob o'brien

1460
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,240
how much time should one allocate betw

1461
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,240
between the 90 minute attention focus

1462
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,400
so

1463
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,599
i would

1464
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,400
say

1465
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,040
90 minutes because that's the modular

1466
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,800
modular uh

1467
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,839
you know

1468
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,680
time factor for the body but really you

1469
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
can you can push it to 30 minutes i

1470
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,800
would say

1471
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,440
uh maybe you could push it to 15 minutes

1472
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,520
if you were trying to do if you actually

1473
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,880
did a a coffee nap or just a regular nap

1474
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
that you managed to figure out how to

1475
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,280
curtail in 15 minutes i think you could

1476
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,119
you get a little bit more recharge from

1477
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,200
that type of activity than you do from

1478
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
just switching your focus to something

1479
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,520
else or relaxing your mind with whatever

1480
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,559
you know however you want to do

1481
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,240
listening to music or whatever but the

1482
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,720
key point is to stop focusing so that

1483
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,920
you can then

1484
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,000
refocus because you can't just can't

1485
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
maintain all the dopamine levels the

1486
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,280
whole time you have to have a a break in

1487
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,920
order to be able to then uh rebuild that

1488
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,720
amount of focus later on so i think 15

1489
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,720
is the probably the minimum

1490
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,800
if you can do 90 you should do 90 that's

1491
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,200
what the body likes

1492
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,760
and thank you very much

1493
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,480
thank you so much i had a quick question

1494
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,720
sure

1495
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,160
how did you go about it

1496
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,040
is 90 minutes for you in other words

1497
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
what kinds of things are you looking at

1498
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,839
to be able to go
