31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
hi ron

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,840
welcome

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
pleased to see so many people here

34
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,880
especially given how many other great

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
talks there are as well

36
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,360
i'm tom crans i am an english guy with a

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
german name who lives in italy and i

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
have latvian citizenship

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,319
so

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,920
i like to give people's profiling

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,599
algorithms a proper proper workout

42
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,520
i'm talking about certification cyber

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
security certifications and the most

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,959
important thing is why should he listen

45
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,840
to me

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
so i've been kicking around the i.t and

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,200
security industry for over 30 years now

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,519
i've run my own consultancy i've worked

49
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
at big4 consultancies i've worked worked

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,080
at niche cyber security consultancies

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
i've spent a lot of time building teams

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,519
my own teams teams for clients teams

53
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
projects hiring people interviewing for

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
projects mentoring people as well

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
so over that time i've built up a

56
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
good feel for what works and what

57
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
doesn't when people apply for roles and

58
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
when you build out teams and part of

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
that is certifications

60
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
i'll dig into some some history of

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
certifications we'll look at what good

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and bad looks like we'll look at the

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
context of certifications within some

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,599
sort of very generic job roles that the

65
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
industry has and then we'll dig into

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
some specific things as well

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
if you're interested in more details

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
about how interviews work and how this

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
ties into the interview process i'm

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
doing a workshop later on for a couple

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
of hours which is an interactive dig

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
into

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
how i interview people how i interview

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080
with other organizations

75
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
and tips and tricks you can use to get

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
through interviews weed out bad

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
companies find good gigs that sort of

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
stuff so if there's any

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,799
interview related questions that you've

80
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,720
got with certifications the workshop's

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
probably the best idea for that we can

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
spend some real time digging into them

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,440
so kicking off

84
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
history of certifications the i.t

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
industry and security in particular is

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
quite immature especially we compare it

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,439
to

88
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
other industries like

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
medicine like civil engineering it's

90
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,080
very well defined what a civil engineer

91
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
is it's very well defined how you

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
certify how you qualify the same for

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
doctor the same for nursing stuff like

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
that security is very different

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
security is still very immature people

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
still can't define

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
what a pen tester does

98
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,238
for some people it's writing reports for

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
other people it's running tools for

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
other people it's actually getting your

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
sleeves rolled up and getting stuck in

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
and very manually hacking about with

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
stuff there's no real consistent

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
definition

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
so the big problem is

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
if you're an employer or if you're a

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
consultancy working for clients how do

108
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
you know the people you're hiring are

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
any good

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
similarly if you're applying for roles

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
how do you differentiate yourself from

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
everyone else

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
it's i've spent five years doing pen

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
testing great how do you differentiate

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
that in a cv how do you stand out

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
interview how do you make yourself stand

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
out

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
so certifications initially came from

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
the iit industry they sprung up in the

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
security industry as well as a way of

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
demonstrating a certain level of

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
experience you could say if i have this

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
certification i at least have this level

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
of experience and you can trust i kind

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
of know what i'm doing

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,960
problem was

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
it all kind of went a bit wrong

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
we've ended up with this now i'm sure

129
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,400
many of you may have seen some of these

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
these certification maps

131
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
this one is from 2020 it's got worse

132
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
since then i'm not going to pick on the

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,479
guy who wrote this because he did his

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,240
best because all of these maps are

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
completely inaccurate they're all

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,800
nonsense i saw one of them saying that

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
togaf an enterprise architecture

138
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
certification was an entry level

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,160
certification if you're a beginner in

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
cyber security you should get togaf

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
utter utter nonsense

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
and this this is a colossal pain because

143
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,600
if you're trying to get into the

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
industry if you're trying to progress

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
your career if you're trying to stand

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
out from everyone else

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
how do you know on there what's good

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
what's bad where are you going to waste

149
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
your time especially given the cost of

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
going on courses especially given the

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
cost of exams especially given the fact

152
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
we've got a finite amount of time and

153
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
energy right i'm

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
too busy and i've got better things to

155
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
do than consistently sit examinations

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
week after week after week so my

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
linkedin profile can have 200 letters

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,319
after it trying to show off how great i

159
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
am

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,319
at a very high level generically

161
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
many companies have no idea what people

162
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
in cyber security do none

163
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,479
even the companies with really great

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
cyber security departments still have no

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,199
idea what they do so they try and map

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
cyber security career progression to

167
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
what they know and this is kind of the

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
generic model that gets used in the

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,199
industry and some of you will

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,600
immediately look at this and say

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
where are the security auditors where

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
the pen testers and that's kind of the

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,039
problem right people don't know where

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,479
they fit into a traditional

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
organizational structure

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,280
at a very sort of high level most

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
organizations think okay an entry-level

178
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
physician is an analyst they're the

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
people who sit there and they gather

180
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
information they gather reports they

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
gather alerts they action them they send

182
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
it off

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,479
an engineer is the person who implements

184
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
tools they build stuff they build the

185
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,360
stuff that the analysts use

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
further up the tree got the architects

187
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
the architects design the stuff that the

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
engineers build that the analysts then

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,319
use

190
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,280
and then right at the very top you've

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
got your chief information security

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
officer

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,759
who has

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
zero involvement whatsoever in any of

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
that and they spend most of their time

196
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
and i say this from bitter experience

197
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
most of their time arguing about budgets

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
arguing about strategy arguing about why

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,599
people aren't following their security

200
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
processes and they're getting shouted at

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
because there's a security breach

202
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
that's the day in the life

203
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,759
all of this as well is complete nonsense

204
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,000
all right i'ma see so on any given day

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
before lunch time i've done the work of

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,120
an analyst i've done the work of an

207
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
engineer and i've done the work of a

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,879
therapist as well

209
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
and that's just before lunch right

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
this does work as a model though for

211
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
roughly sort of gauging what

212
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
certifications fit in at which levels

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
right if you're an analyst and you're

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
just starting out in the industry you do

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
not want to be be pursuing a

216
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
certification that's aimed at an

217
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
architect who should have five or six

218
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
years experience

219
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
despite what

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
some excellent people on linkedin may

221
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
have you say if you're an engineer do

222
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
not try and present yourself as a cso

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
because someone's going to come along

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
and say

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
brilliant write me a business strategy

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
for security for the next five years

227
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
engineering skill set is not going to

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
help you there

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
so what does a good or a bad

230
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
certification look like so again this is

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
based on me building teams this is based

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
on me hiring people this is based on me

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
interviewing lots of people

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
bad certifications always pay to play

235
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
any certification that says you have to

236
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
pay to go on our official course before

237
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
you can sit the exam it's not about

238
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,320
proving knowledge it's about generating

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
revenue and it's not generating revenue

240
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
for you those are valueless

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
certifications and it stands out really

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
badly in the interview

243
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
focusing on tools rather than techniques

244
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
as well

245
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
everyone in this room is here because

246
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
you're interested in hacking right

247
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
you're interested in security you can

248
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,839
sit down you can read a manual you can

249
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
watch some youtube videos you can read a

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,839
how-to document working out how a tool

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,959
works is very very straightforward

252
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
paying several thousand euros to go on a

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
course to be taught how to use a tool

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
it's a colossal waste of time and money

255
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
lots of certifications focus purely on

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
these are tools that hackers use these

257
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
are tools that defenders use

258
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
write me a big fat check and we'll teach

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
you how to click buttons

260
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,000
again

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
not really great when it comes to

262
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,160
demonstrating a skill set

263
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,040
unless you're a parrot

264
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
any mention of ethical hacking

265
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
whatsoever

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,640
this is a huge huge bug bear of mine

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
whenever anyone talks about ethical

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
hacking who's ethics

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,800
mine you don't want those the

270
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
governments some non-profit a

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,560
corporation

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
really you're gonna you're gonna take

273
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
mad larry from oracle's ethics maybe

274
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
zuckerberg's ethics from facebook you're

275
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,279
gonna be an ethical facebook hacker it's

276
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,079
a nonsense phrase any certification any

277
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
course that talks about ethical hacking

278
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
is absolutely rubbish right there's no

279
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
such thing there is merely what is it

280
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,399
you want to do how are you going to

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
defend do you understand how people

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
attack that's what it gets down to

283
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,399
ethics doesn't come into it

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,680
right if you're going to go and rip off

285
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
your employer and pocket a big stack of

286
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
cash a you should be a politician

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
and b

288
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,680
having a badge that says you're an

289
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
ethical hacker isn't going to stop you

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
doing that it's nothing to do with the

291
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
certification of what you've been taught

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
vendor-specific certifications as well

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
now this is the point where i can say

294
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,839
you should all be privileged you're in

295
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,160
the presence of a principal certified

296
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
lotus professional

297
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,040
if you have a problem with cc mail

298
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
i am your man write me a big fat check i

299
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
will fix

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,279
especially cc mail on os2

301
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
vendor-specific certifications

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
are a waste of time right because

303
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,480
technology comes and goes cc mail was

304
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
last used

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,399
25 years ago maybe 20 years ago if you

306
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,320
worked at a really bad company

307
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
i've got a whole stack of sun

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
certifications for solaris unix

309
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
what happened to them they've been sworn

310
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
out by oracle i've even got some silicon

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
graphics certifications when was the

312
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,399
last time you heard that right

313
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
the other danger with vendor-specific

314
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
certifications is that they pigeonhole

315
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,839
you

316
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
have a whole stack of sun solaris

317
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
certifications because at the time

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
that's what i was doing and that paid my

319
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
bills for carried on doing that a i'd be

320
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
unemployed because i've been swallowed

321
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
by oracle but also i'd be pigeonholed as

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
the solaris guy in the current market at

323
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,240
the moment that's not really a great

324
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
place to be

325
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
trying to make the

326
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
the transition from being a solaris guy

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
who deals with big data centers into

328
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
aws cloud or azure is difficult if you

329
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
focus too much on vendor-specific

330
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
qualifications and certifications you

331
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
get railroaded down into the path where

332
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,320
essentially people say you're going to

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
be the aws guy

334
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,760
now that doesn't completely invalidate

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
them right if you're doing a lot of work

336
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
in aws or azure or google cloud it's

337
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
probably worthwhile to have one or two

338
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
certifications there to demonstrate the

339
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
fact you know what you're talking about

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,320
you can see this on linkedin where there

341
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
are people with a gazillion

342
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
certifications and they're quite happy

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
to

344
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
showcase them on their linkedin profile

345
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,839
and say look at me i've had 200

346
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,320
certifications for microsoft azure it's

347
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
like brilliant and you change jobs and

348
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
someone's using google cloud where does

349
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,719
that leave you

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
the final sort of red flag for bad

351
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,800
certifications is claims about post

352
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
certifications salary increases

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
this this is something i particularly

354
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
hate because you get loads of people

355
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
saying oh i'll take out a loan and i'll

356
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
spend 7 000 euros on this course and

357
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,040
afterwards i'll increase my earnings by

358
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,560
20 or 30 000 euros a year doesn't happen

359
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
certifications are there they should be

360
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
there to showcase your experience if you

361
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
don't have the experience and you go for

362
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
the certification

363
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
you're not going to see a jump in salary

364
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,880
you may get hired by a company

365
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
but that company will treat you as

366
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
essentially a cork in the machine and

367
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
say right you slot in here and you do

368
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,240
this job and your pigeon hold and that's

369
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
it

370
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
the thing that gets you

371
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,040
salary increases

372
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
is by being able to demonstrate in an

373
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
interview or to an employer i have all

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
this experience i have all this

375
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
knowledge i've done all this cool stuff

376
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
and by the way i got a certification as

377
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
well

378
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,079
employers pay you

379
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
for your experience

380
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,399
there is a big lie about a certification

381
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,880
will give you x amount of salary or y

382
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
amount of salary

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
it's particularly bad at the moment

384
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,000
especially if you spend time in the uk

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
where you see the uk government with

386
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
loads of these great adverts so and so

387
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,760
was a ballerina and we've cut funding to

388
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
the arts so now everyone is unemployed

389
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
so they're going to retrain at cyber and

390
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
they're going to earn 50 grand a year

391
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
no they're going to be unemployed

392
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,760
you haven't helped them at all

393
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
so what makes a certification good

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
good certification is one that functions

395
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,959
as a capstone to your experience you can

396
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,199
use it to be able to demonstrate i have

397
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,600
x years of doing this and i passed the

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
certification

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
as additional proof of that it's a way

400
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
of essentially demonstrating that you

401
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
know you're talking about and you took

402
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,000
the certification exam

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
ideally that exam should have a

404
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,519
practical component

405
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
it's really really easy to sit down chew

406
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
through 40 multiple choice questions and

407
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
come out with a bit of paper at the end

408
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
that says you're certified i've done it

409
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
myself and on my hand i have at least

410
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
two certifications where i showed up i

411
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
spent 15 minutes clicking multiple

412
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
choice questions

413
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
and came out with two passes

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
does that demonstrate expertise no

415
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,199
demonstrates a certain level of

416
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,199
arrogance and a certain level of hacking

417
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,040
the process but it doesn't demonstrate

418
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,279
expertise so ideally your certification

419
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,040
should have a practical element you

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
should have something where you

421
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,880
demonstrate i've read this stuff i've

422
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
learned this stuff here's how it works

423
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
there should also be different levels as

424
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
well going back to that model we have

425
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
analyst engineer architecture so you

426
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,079
know the career progression based on

427
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
experience there should be different

428
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,600
levels of certification as well that

429
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,000
test different depths of experience

430
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,240
and finally it should have some sort of

431
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
aspect of continuous development

432
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,160
my much coveted later ccmail

433
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
certifications never expire the fact

434
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,639
that losses doesn't exist anymore

435
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,160
doesn't even matter right they never

436
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
expired anyway for eternity it will be

437
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
on my tombstone that i was a principal

438
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,160
certified lotus professional

439
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,720
those certifications are not good ones

440
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
right it's

441
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
technology moves on a weekly on a

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
monthly basis especially in security

443
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
where attacks are constantly evolving a

444
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
certification that sits there and says

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
here's your paper it's valid forever you

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
don't need to do a re-test you don't

447
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
need to demonstrate continuous learning

448
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
again that's not a good way of

449
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,560
demonstrating knowledge it's a good way

450
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
of demonstrating you know how to park a

451
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
tear pass the test

452
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
one thing i haven't mentioned on here is

453
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,920
ugly certifications and we'll be

454
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,279
covering those right at the end but when

455
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
i talk about ugly certifications i'm

456
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
talking about ones that

457
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
have issues with them they're they're

458
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
not well known

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,079
um they're poorly thought out they have

460
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,680
problems when you go and pass them

461
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
there's some value there but it's kind

462
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,079
of hidden it's a bit difficult

463
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
one certification i'll talk about the

464
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,920
end is mid in scandal and that's kind of

465
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,360
devalued the value of it a bit

466
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,519
so

467
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,720
cracking on cracking on with the good

468
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
so starting at the entry level the

469
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
analyst level comp tia certifications

470
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,119
network plus security plus

471
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
if you are joining industry if you don't

472
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
have much experience these are really

473
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,679
great certifications to have because

474
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,400
they test a breadth of knowledge

475
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,039
now yes the multiple choice questions

476
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,959
yes there isn't a practical element but

477
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
when you're starting off you probably

478
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,480
don't have the experience to be able to

479
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
do a practical test

480
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,679
and

481
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
especially the network plus and security

482
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
plus as well as well thought out it it

483
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
covers a broad range of stuff that

484
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
you're most likely to meet

485
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,559
when you're doing an analyst role when

486
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
you're working in a security operations

487
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
center when you're working as a junior

488
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
member of a team

489
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
people i see with these certifications

490
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
when they come to interview they have a

491
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
good level of grounding knowledge

492
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
they're able to explain how stuff works

493
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,520
which makes them excellent as part of a

494
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,679
team and also means that if you've got

495
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
those certifications you've got the good

496
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
foundations to start building on that

497
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,840
knowledge and advancing further from

498
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
that

499
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,039
another good entry-level one and i know

500
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
i said vendor certifications are bad

501
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
kind of make an exception for this one

502
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
so cisco's entry level certification the

503
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,240
ccna they have a security component from

504
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
that

505
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
and again i rate that quite a lot that

506
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
covers a lot of things about routing and

507
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
switching and networking and network

508
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
attacks and network security that's all

509
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
stuff as an analyst you're going to be

510
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,160
dealing with

511
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,919
analysts will be doing stuff like

512
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,080
monitoring firewalls monitoring routers

513
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,400
monitoring network attacks

514
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,240
if you've got a certification that shows

515
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
that you've covered that it gives an

516
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
interviewer and an employer a certain

517
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,200
level of confidence

518
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,799
that you have the skills to be able to

519
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,320
be dropped in and say okay here's our

520
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,400
network go and protect it

521
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,480
so all three of those are good entry

522
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
level certifications

523
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
going a bit

524
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,480
above that looking at sort of a more

525
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
senior role

526
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
our isaka's

527
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,919
certified information security manager

528
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,360
this ism

529
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
appalling appalling acronym but there we

530
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
go

531
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,919
to demonstrate that you understand wider

532
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
security issues to demonstrate you

533
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,840
understand how security works in an

534
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
organization

535
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
this is a really good certification that

536
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,039
again is a good way of demonstrating

537
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
you've got the skills in there

538
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
a lot of security is not about

539
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
technology it's not even about defeating

540
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
attackers it's spending your time

541
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,440
talking with people who have no idea

542
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
what you're talking about it's

543
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
convincing that there's a problem it's

544
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
managing other teams to be able to

545
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
support you as you try and get fixes in

546
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
it's working with developers with

547
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
engineers with hr getting policies

548
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
enforced all this sort of stuff

549
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
so saka certifications in particular

550
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
cover lots of areas they give you a a

551
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,799
good test that you've got skills in that

552
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
area and again because

553
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
if you see a security attack the fix is

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
okay we implement these firewall rules

555
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
easy intelligence is not the problem

556
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,440
there convincing other teams that they

557
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,120
should have a business outage while you

558
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,559
knock out their network connection and

559
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
apply those firewall rules that's the

560
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,280
difficult bit again if you've got

561
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,440
certification like that

562
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,039
where you've been able to demonstrate

563
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
you know how to talk about security in

564
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
the context of the wider company it's a

565
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
valuable thing to have

566
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
moving on a bit going down the list of

567
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
more deeply technical stuff the oscp

568
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,440
anyone who's got an oscp i instantly

569
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,159
want to bring into an interview it is

570
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,600
a bugger of a exam to pass it's

571
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
practical you've got to write a report

572
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
it's very complex it's very taxing

573
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
there's literally no mercy and whenever

574
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,159
you ask for help everyone laughs at you

575
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,720
and says try harder it's a fantastic

576
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
motto to have

577
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,799
anyone who wants to be a pen tester in

578
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,360
any sort of serious capacity the oscp is

579
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
a fantastic way of demonstrating you

580
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
know what you're doing i will take the

581
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
oscp over anything else when i'm

582
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
building an offensive security team it

583
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
is hands down one of the best

584
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
certifications out there

585
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
and because it's purely practical it

586
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
really really tests your ability not to

587
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
use tools but to solve problems and

588
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
that's one of the key things that people

589
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
who are doing offensive security need to

590
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
understand how do you solve problems how

591
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
do you get to the root cause of

592
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
something and then how do you work to

593
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,159
exploit that and then to defend it

594
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
oscp is great for that

595
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
finally sis

596
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
cis gets a lot of bad press

597
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,919
largely because people don't understand

598
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
the context of it

599
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
now i know two recruitment agencies in

600
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,799
the uk

601
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,039
who explicitly tell every single

602
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,559
candidate to put on their cv that

603
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,400
they're studying for the cis

604
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
you're going for an analyst role you've

605
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
got years experience put down your

606
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,039
studying for the cis

607
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
right it's that sort of nonsense that

608
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,720
devalues the context of that

609
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
certification you've got to have five

610
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
years experience

611
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,919
you've got to have five years experience

612
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,840
that someone else has validated on your

613
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
cv

614
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
and that for me makes it a really really

615
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
good certification for an architect to

616
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
have for a senior person a senior

617
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
engineer because

618
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
if you get to the point in your career

619
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
where you've got five six seven years

620
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
experience of doing security in the real

621
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
world why would you not take the exam

622
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
it's a great way of demonstrating a

623
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
skill set if you've got that level of

624
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
experience it's relatively easy to pass

625
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
people bang on about the cysts being a

626
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
difficult exam and in some ways it is

627
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,200
especially if you don't know you con

628
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
your subject matter

629
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
if you do have the experience it's a

630
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
great way of demonstrating it

631
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
to the point where if i'm interviewing

632
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
four senior architect roles these are

633
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
roles where the salary is six figures

634
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
six figures plus these are people who

635
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
should have 10 12 years experience and

636
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
i'm dropping them into banks financial

637
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,120
services

638
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,240
critical national infrastructure

639
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,840
companies

640
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
those people

641
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
i expect to have assist because they

642
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,640
should have the breadth and depth of

643
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
knowledge to be able to pass that very

644
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,280
easily to be able to walk the exam

645
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,799
it's almost to the point where if you

646
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,320
have enough experience and you don't

647
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,559
have a cis that starts to raise red

648
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,080
flags in the interviewers because

649
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,520
they're saying

650
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,559
why would you not do it it's a

651
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,559
no-brainer at this point the other

652
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,320
advantage is

653
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
the entire industry knows about the cis

654
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,200
you get companies who couldn't spell cso

655
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
but they know what assist is and they

656
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
put it on their job descriptions it's

657
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
very well recognized and so therefore if

658
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
you do have it and you're using it as a

659
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
way of demonstrating your expertise and

660
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
experience it's a great thing to have if

661
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,640
you're in a more senior role if you're

662
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
looking to progress

663
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
absolutely the cis

664
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
now the flip side of that is there's a

665
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
whole bunch of specializations under

666
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,039
there there's a cloud specialization

667
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
there's a couple of others

668
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
it doesn't doesn't really have much

669
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,919
value it's the main syst that really

670
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
matters specializations

671
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
if you have a cis i kind of expect you

672
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
to know what cloud computing is and how

673
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
to secure that

674
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
fundamentally it's not much different

675
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
from a data center right still computers

676
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
it's still got network connections it's

677
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,240
still running software you still need to

678
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
defend it it's all kind of the same

679
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
stuff

680
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,480
so that's the good

681
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
let's look at the bad

682
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,440
right starting off with my personal pet

683
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,080
hate the certified ethical hacker

684
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
this this

685
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
triggers all of my prejudices right it

686
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,559
mentions ethical hacking you've got to

687
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
pay to go on their courses it teaches

688
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
you how to use tools

689
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,559
and the worst thing the biggest crime of

690
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
all is that the ec council have a huge

691
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,640
marketing budget and they've brainwashed

692
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
people into thinking the ch is a must

693
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,240
have to land a job it absolutely is not

694
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
right if you're thinking about taking it

695
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
save your money do something else if

696
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
you've got the ch be proud you pass the

697
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,880
exam that's a difficult thing to do

698
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
don't give them any more money

699
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
focus on something else

700
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
in fact while we're slagging off the ec

701
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,440
council literally everything from them

702
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,919
is bad

703
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,360
now there's a couple of reasons for this

704
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
it's not just blind hatred on my part

705
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,240
now firstly the ec council and their

706
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,919
employees have a history of stealing

707
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
people's content from books from blogs

708
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,360
from courses

709
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
putting it in their paid for courses and

710
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,679
they're not compensated acknowledging it

711
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
i know at least three people have very

712
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
publicly tried to sue the ec council

713
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
over this they've tried to have their

714
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,799
published content removed they haven't

715
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,320
even got an apology

716
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
right the ec council have a long long

717
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
history of essentially stealing people's

718
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
content

719
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,880
charging for it and then making it as

720
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
difficult as possible to get you either

721
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,200
compensated or have your content removed

722
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,039
now that for me is enough to to

723
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
blacklist any certification from them

724
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,240
but again they keep on banging on about

725
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,320
your being an ethical hacker and all of

726
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
their stuff even through to their

727
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,279
cso qualification how do you qualify

728
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
someone who's at a business level all

729
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
right

730
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
you you don't take a bunch of tests and

731
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,559
exams that say oh

732
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,080
show on this form what a good budget

733
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
projection looks like right it's

734
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,679
it just doesn't work at all

735
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,200
the other thing as well is that it's

736
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
always pay for play all of their

737
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
certifications it's very difficult to

738
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
get knowledge about it the ch has been

739
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
around for ages you'll see a lot of core

740
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
stumps on the pirate bay for the ch

741
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
because people have ripped off the

742
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
courses and they've shared it around

743
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,960
some of their other courses are going

744
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
that way as well

745
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
because they charge an absolute fortune

746
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,080
to sit in a classroom and be taught how

747
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
to use tools as you get to the more

748
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
senior certifications you get taught to

749
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,039
use more expensive tools and to use

750
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,320
tools in more complicated ways

751
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,840
personally i can watch a youtube video

752
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360
for that i don't need to fork out a few

753
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,159
thousand euros

754
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,120
vendor certifications are another one

755
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,559
any vendor certification

756
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,039
with the context of as i mentioned

757
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
earlier if you're doing some work with a

758
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
particular cloud provider

759
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,200
yeah okay if your employer is paying for

760
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,279
it if it's easy to take the exam do it

761
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
as a way of demonstrating your expertise

762
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,039
and that cloud provider

763
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,200
i would always argue that

764
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
rather than having a dedicated vendor

765
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
certification like i'm going to pick on

766
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,000
juniper juniper firewall certification

767
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,279
great you know how to use juniper

768
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
firewalls you apply for a job whether

769
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
you're cisco firewalls suddenly your

770
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,960
juniper firewall certification is not

771
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
only useless it acts against you because

772
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
people won't shortlist you because they

773
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
say well he's a specialist in juniper

774
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
firewalls he doesn't know about cisco

775
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
stuff it's a different operating system

776
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
we won't bring him through to interview

777
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
so rather look at vendor certifications

778
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
look at what area that they're working

779
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,919
in again if you're talking about routing

780
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
switching firewalls cisco ccna is

781
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
probably a better one it's a broader

782
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,240
reach it doesn't teach you how to use

783
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,799
cisco gear it teaches you how to secure

784
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,399
the network

785
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
cloud computing there's cloud security

786
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
alliance they do some certifications

787
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,679
that's a good way of saying you

788
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,679
understand cloud computing

789
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
even better is some sort of architecture

790
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,240
certification that says you know how to

791
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
build scalable systems because then that

792
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
doesn't just cover every single cloud

793
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,919
provider it covers traditional data

794
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
centers it covers hybrid cloud covers

795
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
distributed global organizations all

796
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
sorts of stuff

797
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
so have a think before you go down the

798
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
vendor certification route take a step

799
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,880
back and think actually

800
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
do i want to be certified in a product

801
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
or do i want to be certified in a type

802
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
of technology and what's more valuable

803
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,559
for me as i look at my career

804
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
anything pay to play

805
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
there's absolutely no reason right if

806
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,799
you're taking an exam

807
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,880
to pass a certification you should be

808
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
able to rock up and say i've got xc as

809
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
experience in this i'm going to sit the

810
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,039
exam ace it and walk away with a bit of

811
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,360
paper that shows it if you have to pay

812
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,279
someone to go on their course

813
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,720
you're generating revenue for that

814
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
organization you're not generating

815
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,919
revenue for yourself you're not

816
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
generating any sort of expertise for

817
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
yourself you're literally just printing

818
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
money for whichever the certification

819
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,000
organization is

820
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and finally

821
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
sabza

822
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
one of the sacred holy cows of the

823
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,799
security world

824
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,039
sabza is a architecture framework for

825
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
building security architecture and

826
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,279
organizations

827
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,919
two problems with that the first one is

828
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
the only way you can get any information

829
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,200
on samsa

830
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,120
even the documentation that

831
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
it goes before the course you've got to

832
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
buy it from samsa

833
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,559
you want to read the manual on samsa

834
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
brilliant cough up some cash you want to

835
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
understand how to train on sabsa

836
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,080
brilliant cough up some cash you want to

837
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
take the exam brilliant cough up some

838
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
cash go on the course

839
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
now that's at a knock on effect because

840
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
the rest of the industry has said why

841
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
are we paying thousands and thousands

842
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,120
and thousands of euros to send all of

843
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,200
our architects on a sabza course when

844
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,399
it's just teaching them security

845
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
architecture and it's costing us a

846
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,760
fortune

847
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
so in the industry people have stopped

848
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
asking for sabsa to be able to prove you

849
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
can do security architecture

850
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,200
instead organizations have been asking

851
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
for things like togaf which is from the

852
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,279
open group and that's that's a

853
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,440
certification that covers enterprise

854
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
architecture

855
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,279
now samsa is fairly rigid it deals with

856
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,039
security and it deals with security in a

857
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
specific way

858
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,159
every single organization i've worked

859
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
with who have tried to implement samsa

860
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,679
have failed

861
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,000
it's a very brittle non-flexible

862
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
framework

863
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
togaf on the other hand you can pick and

864
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
choose you can look at bits of it and

865
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
say this makes sense i'm going to build

866
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,320
out a library of

867
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
uh blessed software and blessed

868
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,960
components so that whenever people come

869
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
to build something they can just go to

870
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
the togaf library and say this is stuff

871
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,240
we've tested we know it works we know

872
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,159
it's supported we'll use this stuff it's

873
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,919
a really great way of doing stuff a

874
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
review of your documentation the way

875
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,000
togaf does it continuous improvement

876
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
very good way of doing it it's very

877
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,039
flexible

878
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,960
organizations i've seen have used toga

879
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
to do enterprise security architecture

880
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,679
have done very well with it because they

881
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,080
can pick and choose components they can

882
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
go through and say this is relevant for

883
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,840
us today this is not relevant for us but

884
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,519
it might be next year in two years time

885
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,679
or something like that

886
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
so sabsa stands out as a a bad

887
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
architecture certification there are

888
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,679
better options out there

889
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,279
and additionally

890
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,120
costs a fortune and if you go to your

891
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
employer and say

892
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
i would like you to pay for me to be so

893
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,279
the employer is going to laugh at you

894
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,399
i've

895
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,480
not found any employer now who's willing

896
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
to pony up the cash for samsa

897
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,559
certification partly because it's hugely

898
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,399
expensive and partly because what does

899
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,720
the employer get from the end of it

900
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
if you know how to build architecture

901
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
why do they have to pay thousands to

902
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,000
send you on a course to learn how to

903
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
design architecture

904
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,039
right

905
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,240
final section the ugly stuff

906
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,799
so sans

907
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
sans are a great organization right i

908
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
really rate their training courses i

909
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
really rate their certifications the

910
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,840
giac is equivalent to sis right it's a

911
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
great certification

912
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
the problem is

913
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,240
all of the sans certifications sound

914
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
like my cat throwing up a hairball all

915
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
right it's it's unfortunate but it's

916
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,840
true

917
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
yak gisp

918
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,679
pick

919
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
you try go to your boss and say i want

920
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,679
to spend a few thousand pounds on a

921
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,240
training course for the kick

922
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,840
it's not going to end well

923
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,080
the other problem is

924
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,159
sans have focused a lot on the content

925
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,159
of their courses they focused a lot on

926
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,320
making sure that if you get a sand

927
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,000
certification it has value it's a good

928
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,159
way of demonstrating skills problem is

929
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,200
they haven't spent that much on

930
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,360
marketing or convincing anyone else

931
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
so the number of job postings i see that

932
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,399
ask for asan certification or even

933
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,679
recognize

934
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,519
that there are some sand certifications

935
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,679
that equivalent to cisp

936
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,480
i've seen two in the last year

937
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,279
out of several thousand job postings

938
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,440
that i've had to draw through it's not

939
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,159
widely recognized

940
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,080
why is that jumping forwards

941
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
that causes a problem because again if

942
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
you invest time and money in a

943
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,880
certification that showcases your skills

944
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
and expertise

945
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,720
if you have to explain to someone what

946
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
that certification is and why it's

947
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,279
valuable

948
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,000
you kind of got an uphill struggle there

949
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,679
you know think about the people who are

950
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,120
going to be interviewing you think of

951
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
the people that you're going to be

952
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,919
working with in organizations if they

953
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,960
don't know the value of the

954
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
certification

955
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
how are they going to know that you're

956
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
any better than someone else who doesn't

957
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,320
have the certification how they're going

958
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
to be able to judge your skill set

959
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
so sansa kind of let themselves down a

960
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,679
bit from that

961
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,799
now

962
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,240
if you get the chance to go to course if

963
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,600
you get a chance to take a sound

964
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
certification grab it with both hands

965
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,159
it's great right they're great courses

966
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
they're great certifications

967
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,640
but they have problems with visibility

968
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,159
and with pronunciation as well

969
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
one that's come up newly

970
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
is concordia

971
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
concordia are a consortium they've had

972
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
funding from the eu

973
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,559
and essentially eu has basically said

974
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,480
we've got loads of really shady

975
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
consultants people like tom who talk

976
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
nonsense alice and steal our wallets we

977
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,440
need to know that a cyber security

978
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,199
consultant has a certain level of

979
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,960
expertise

980
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,280
so the concordia consortium

981
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,159
is from cyber security firms it's from

982
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,639
legal firms it's from universities and

983
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,639
they've pulled their resources they went

984
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,639
out to the industry in general and said

985
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,239
what are good skills for a consultant to

986
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,040
have now i was part of that i took part

987
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
in the initial stuff they've built up a

988
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,639
definition that says okay a cyber

989
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,560
security consultant should have these

990
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,599
skills

991
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,440
let's build a course to teach those

992
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
skills and let's build an exam to test

993
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
those skills

994
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,879
the the c3 certification has a

995
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,560
coursera component

996
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
we go online you do some distance

997
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
learning on coursera

998
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,800
it has a interactive lecture component

999
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,320
where you sit down with some experts and

1000
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
they go into a deep dive into certain

1001
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
areas

1002
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
has a theoretical exam where you have

1003
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,960
some questions and answers fairly

1004
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,280
standard stuff and as a practical exam

1005
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,720
we have a number of different cyber

1006
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,839
ranges and you have to be able to

1007
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,920
accomplish tasks

1008
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,160
as a certification it's really really

1009
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,960
good if you don't have all of the skills

1010
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
the courses that you take

1011
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
will teach you those skills and they

1012
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
cover a good breadth of stuff it's not

1013
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,000
just how do you do defense it's how do

1014
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,839
you do attack how do you deal with

1015
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,760
organizational issues how do you work

1016
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,640
out

1017
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
budget issues how do you work out if

1018
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
it's worthwhile buying this tool versus

1019
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
that tool you know what's how do you

1020
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,520
calculate return on investment this is

1021
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,280
all stuff businesses want this is all

1022
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,560
good good solid stuff

1023
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,119
the other really good thing about it is

1024
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,200
that it's free

1025
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
it costs you nothing

1026
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
now

1027
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,880
it's on the ugly list because they're

1028
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,160
still getting going i believe at the

1029
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,839
moment they're on the third tranche of

1030
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,280
people coming through

1031
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
they only run

1032
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
three or four of these courses a year so

1033
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,440
even if you sign up to come to the

1034
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,520
coursera course you have to complete it

1035
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
in a set time limit if you don't it's

1036
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,680
yanked from course era and it's dormant

1037
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
until it comes up again and they have a

1038
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,440
limited intake as well because they're

1039
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
not dedicated to doing this

1040
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
certification

1041
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
the other downside

1042
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,920
uh apart from

1043
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,560
limited numbers and limited availability

1044
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
is that again no one really knows about

1045
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,440
it now within the cyber security

1046
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,640
organization in the eu e-nicer they know

1047
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
about it they're trying to promote it if

1048
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,240
you're in the eu you're going to see

1049
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
this becoming more and more

1050
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
visible you're going to see it being

1051
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
asked for more and more outside of that

1052
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
though no one's ever heard of it no one

1053
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,079
knows what it is what it does which is a

1054
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
shame because it's genuinely one of the

1055
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,960
really great certifications that helps

1056
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,880
you gain some knowledge helps you

1057
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,400
demonstrate the knowledge and gives you

1058
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,079
a meaningful certification at the end of

1059
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,359
it

1060
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,040
keep an eye out it there should be

1061
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,800
another tranche of

1062
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,880
training courses available towards the

1063
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,119
end of this year i think october time

1064
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,800
like i say it's free jumper that chance

1065
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,200
free high quality training don't often

1066
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,000
get an option of that

1067
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
degrees

1068
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,240
degrees as a certification

1069
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
i'd be remiss given that we're in st

1070
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,640
john's university not to mention degrees

1071
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,119
degrees are a form of certification

1072
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,599
the fact that they take several years as

1073
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,760
opposed to a couple of weeks

1074
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
doesn't really matter you study some

1075
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
stuff you pass an exam to show you got

1076
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,960
the knowledge you got to pay for it

1077
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,240
i've personal experience with degrees

1078
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
from imperial college and royal holloway

1079
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
in london

1080
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
absolutely top-notch degrees they don't

1081
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
just teach about cyber security they

1082
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,599
teach about things like social

1083
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
engineering they teach things like

1084
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,359
psychology so you can understand how

1085
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,640
attackers work they teach budgets

1086
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
they they cover the entire spectrum of

1087
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
stuff

1088
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,280
in the uk and the us the spy agencies

1089
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,079
gchq and nsa have both jumped to this

1090
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,680
and said actually we're going to get

1091
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,640
involved

1092
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
and the spy agencies now validate degree

1093
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,359
courses to make sure they teach a nice

1094
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,200
breadth of knowledge so that it's

1095
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
relevant

1096
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,520
additionally if you fancy being a spy

1097
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,839
ghq

1098
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,280
gchq and nsa

1099
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,960
keep an eye on the people who graduate

1100
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
from these and it's quite likely you get

1101
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,839
a job offer from them you want to go and

1102
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
work for the spies great we're doing it

1103
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,320
luckily

1104
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
i've i've checked so john's university

1105
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
doing nsa accredited cyber security

1106
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,760
degree

1107
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,200
excellent

1108
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,599
now it's on the ugly list because

1109
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
there's lots of degrees out there that

1110
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,240
claim to be cyber security degrees

1111
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,640
and are essentially a three-year ch

1112
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,079
course it's three years of here's a tool

1113
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,480
let's spend an entire semester learning

1114
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
how burp suite works

1115
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
next semester let's look at

1116
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,640
metasploit

1117
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,599
right

1118
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,040
again this is stuff you can teach

1119
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
yourself it's stuff you can learn over

1120
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
the weekend you can watch youtube videos

1121
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,800
you don't need to be forking out tens of

1122
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,280
thousands of dollars a year to be taught

1123
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
how to use tools

1124
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,599
so look at degrees

1125
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,200
with a grain of salt some of them are

1126
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,040
like i say that are accredited have been

1127
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,760
validated some of them which have a very

1128
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
good reputation in industry absolutely

1129
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
worthwhile

1130
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
the rest of them colossal waste of money

1131
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,680
and given the cost of degrees it's not

1132
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,280
worth going down a poor degree course

1133
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,599
now finally crest

1134
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
you can't imagine how thrilled i was to

1135
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,400
written this slide deck and they're

1136
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
rocked up and see there's the guys from

1137
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,359
crest with a stand here and they're a

1138
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,040
sponsor of hope

1139
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,960
excellent

1140
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,520
so what's the issue with crest crest was

1141
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,119
originally developed in the uk because

1142
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,880
the uk government was hiring a bunch of

1143
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,960
pen testers who did all sorts of weird

1144
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,200
stuff and there was no consistent way of

1145
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,520
testing uk government infrastructure

1146
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
so crest was formed

1147
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,200
crest is a non-profit organization and

1148
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
it was designed to essentially have a

1149
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
level of certification for penetration

1150
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
testing and for security assurance so

1151
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,880
the government departments in the uk

1152
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
could say i've had a crest certified

1153
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,480
audit i've had a crest certified pen

1154
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,800
test we kind of know stuff is okay

1155
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,319
all sounds good

1156
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,079
they're practical exams

1157
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,200
they they test your skill set it's a

1158
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,040
good certification to have

1159
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,520
all sounds really great

1160
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,119
however

1161
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
in the uk there's a very large cyber

1162
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,960
security firm called ncc

1163
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,119
they do the majority of crest testing

1164
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,800
for the government they are a big big

1165
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
organization

1166
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,760
their director

1167
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
was the head of the crest board

1168
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
about the time when some people posted a

1169
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,240
whole bunch of documents up on social

1170
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,200
media

1171
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
that showed the ncc had run a crest

1172
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,839
testing lab in their building

1173
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
and that they had course notes and

1174
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
answers and questions and information

1175
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,240
dumps on ncc headed note paper along

1176
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,839
with a bunch of emails from ncc

1177
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,680
internally telling people how to pass

1178
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
the exam

1179
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,359
so it's kind of a problem right if

1180
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,599
you're dealing with security assurance

1181
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,119
and it turns out that actually one of

1182
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,000
your biggest biggest revenue generators

1183
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,599
for your organization

1184
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,920
cheating at the tests

1185
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
be bad

1186
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
now the problem is

1187
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
how does crest investigate itself when

1188
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,599
the director of the company that's been

1189
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,440
accused of cheating is the head of the

1190
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,119
board

1191
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,960
a bit of an ethical dilemma there going

1192
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
back to ethical hacking

1193
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,520
so what they did was they brought in a

1194
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
third party an ex-policeman he did a

1195
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
review of it

1196
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,280
there was lots of

1197
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,359
concern in the industry at the time

1198
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,359
because let's say i'm crest certified

1199
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,280
let's say at the time i was working for

1200
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
a small cyber security company they were

1201
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,520
going for crest certification it was

1202
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
kind of an open secret that people from

1203
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,599
ncc have been cheating at this

1204
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,880
but what do you do

1205
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,119
if you go public and say oh

1206
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,920
the biggest revenue generator and the

1207
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
head of your board

1208
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,079
their company has been cheating

1209
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,599
do you think you're still going to have

1210
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,359
your crest certification at the end of

1211
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,319
the day

1212
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
probably not and there was lots of worry

1213
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
in the industry about people speaking

1214
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
out about this because if you're a small

1215
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,839
consultancy or if you're an individual

1216
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,520
self-employed

1217
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
and you're generating your income by

1218
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,119
testing uk government infrastructure

1219
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
under crest if something threatens our

1220
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
certification that means you're going to

1221
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
be out of a job and kind of unemployable

1222
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
so lots of people didn't speak out about

1223
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,440
this

1224
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,160
there's an investigation

1225
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,119
one person came forward voluntarily with

1226
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,520
information now this is an industry that

1227
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,200
had hundreds and hundreds of people who

1228
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,480
are certified

1229
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,760
people had openly been talking about

1230
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,160
this on social media one person came

1231
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
forward

1232
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,920
the result of the investigation was

1233
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,520
basically something that we've all heard

1234
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,119
recently in the newspapers and in the

1235
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,079
news there's a few bad apples

1236
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,440
um ncc did not get or looked in any way

1237
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,640
at all

1238
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,359
the director was allowed to continue as

1239
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,839
the head of the board and in fact the

1240
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,640
crest investigation said that

1241
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,400
despite the fact that it was using an

1242
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,480
ncc email system despite the fact that

1243
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,200
it was in ncc premises

1244
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,240
ncc are only vicariously responsible

1245
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,599
they couldn't have known what was going

1246
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,640
on

1247
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
now this was a few years ago they've

1248
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,599
redone their testing process they've

1249
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,200
redone their certification they've

1250
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
rewritten their t's and c's and their

1251
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,760
privacy notices

1252
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,440
if it wasn't that bad why do you need to

1253
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,800
do all of that

1254
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,319
and if it was that bad why did no one

1255
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,680
get punished

1256
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,440
so the problem now is that if you've got

1257
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,839
a crest certification there's this sort

1258
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,520
of

1259
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,400
aura of unpleasantness about it i know a

1260
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
bunch of people who have decided to

1261
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,960
not renew their crest certification i

1262
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,319
know a bunch of organizations who've

1263
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,520
decided they're going to ditch it and

1264
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
they're going to go for the oscp instead

1265
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,319
and this is kind of a problem so

1266
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,400
the certification itself is good

1267
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,160
it has a bit of a bad reputation

1268
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
certainly in the uk now crests are

1269
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,079
expanding globally that's why the guys

1270
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,680
are here today they're expanding to the

1271
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
us and beyond

1272
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,720
go and talk to them talk about the

1273
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,040
certification because it's a good one

1274
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
but bear in mind if you're in the uk

1275
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,720
definitely there's kind of some problems

1276
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,079
with it

1277
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,400
now running out of time very quickly

1278
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,839
warning about the future what does

1279
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,119
certification look like when it goes bad

1280
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,280
in the uk we have the ministry of fun

1281
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,800
and you can imagine why they're called

1282
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,680
that

1283
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,040
they decided to come up with something

1284
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,680
called the uk cyber security council we

1285
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,800
have in the uk two institutes under

1286
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,720
royal charter that are unable to do

1287
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,480
essentially chartered engineer status

1288
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,400
for security people there's already an

1289
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
organization that does this

1290
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,160
the

1291
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,480
uk csc is headed by a guy who is a

1292
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
career ngo person he's never worked in

1293
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,880
cyber security there's one person on

1294
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,480
their board it's got any cyber security

1295
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
experience the rest are academics and

1296
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,720
career advisors for the government they

1297
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
immediately launched a consultation that

1298
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,000
said we want

1299
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,319
we want to see if people agree with us

1300
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,319
there should be mandatory certification

1301
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,000
for every cyber security professional in

1302
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,160
the uk and there should be a mandatory

1303
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,920
register for every cyber security

1304
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,760
professional in the uk

1305
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,920
now spoke earlier on about the different

1306
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,160
job tiers and how it's a really crap

1307
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,359
model

1308
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,520
this falls foul of that immediately

1309
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,240
am i a csa am i an architect well

1310
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,599
if i've got to

1311
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,599
just put my name on a mandatory register

1312
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,880
and if i've had a mandatory

1313
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,480
certification that says i'm either a

1314
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,560
ceasar or an architect

1315
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,400
you've crippled my career chances how am

1316
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,359
i going to change how i'm going to move

1317
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,680
how i'm going to sell my services

1318
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,119
it's essentially a poorly thought out

1319
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,280
plan by people who don't do the job

1320
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,119
and all it was about was gatekeeping and

1321
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,319
control

1322
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,960
the the agenda from there was we want a

1323
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,119
bunch of people who know how to use

1324
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
tools and who could be pigeonholed into

1325
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,760
an organization and told what to do

1326
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,520
which is the complete opposite of what

1327
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,040
cyber security people and hackers should

1328
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,280
be doing which is root cause analysis

1329
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,119
problem solving how does this stuff work

1330
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,720
how do i break it how do i make it

1331
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,839
better how do i fix it

1332
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,720
as with all politicians and career civil

1333
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
servants

1334
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
just because this consultation was

1335
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,160
defeated doesn't mean it's gone away

1336
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,839
it's going to come back again and again

1337
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,920
and again and this is the dodgy bit of

1338
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,440
certification and this is something that

1339
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,040
we all need to look out for

1340
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,599
certification again is about proving you

1341
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,760
have the skills it's not about

1342
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,920
controlling and limiting people in cyber

1343
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,000
security and stopping people with

1344
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,760
certain backgrounds from entering the

1345
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,599
industry

1346
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,440
and on that note

1347
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,119
running out of time very quickly we've

1348
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,240
got any questions from anyone

1349
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,440
sorry i couldn't hear that

1350
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,440
yes i've completely missed grc um

1351
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,599
that could almost be its entire own

1352
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,760
section to be honest because

1353
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,599
in the way that offensive and defensive

1354
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,119
security is kind of like its own

1355
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,119
industry i'd say that grc is its own

1356
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,640
industry as well you've got auditors

1357
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,000
you've got people making policy you've

1358
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,240
got people enforcing policy

1359
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,400
it's a very complex mix

1360
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,160
but i would say again the the

1361
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,760
organizations that provide good

1362
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,240
certifications they will provide good

1363
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,200
certifications in the grc space as well

1364
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,400
so isakka do a

1365
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,040
an auditor ceasar one

1366
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,920
again

1367
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
pretty highly rated uh comparable with

1368
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,359
the cism as well for that sort of stuff

1369
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,839
so there's some comparisons there

1370
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,960
all right we've got a quick question

1371
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
from the chat what do you think about

1372
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
sitting for an exam like cissp even if

1373
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,240
you don't meet all the other

1374
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,640
qualifications

1375
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,079
uh what do you think about sitting in

1376
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
the sis if you don't meet the

1377
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,240
qualifications

1378
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,280
why pay for an exam

1379
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,119
if you can't get the certification at

1380
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,880
the end of it when that cash is coming

1381
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
out your own pocket

1382
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,640
i'd rather spend that on rum and ice

1383
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,440
cream to be honest

1384
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,400
if if you take the exam and you pass it

1385
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,839
how are you going to present that to an

1386
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,000
employer or in a workspace oh i took the

1387
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
exam and i passed it but i don't have

1388
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,960
the qualification

1389
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,200
people are then going to say okay so you

1390
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,119
you're not certified

1391
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,559
reject

1392
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,359
um

1393
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,440
you know the the the goal is should

1394
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,640
never be

1395
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,520
to pass an exam the goal should be to

1396
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,880
demonstrate you've got the knowledge

1397
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,160
any other questions

1398
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,440
what do you think of renewals

1399
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,800
what do i think of renewals and

1400
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,800
recertifications

1401
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,200
on the one hand they're a pain in the

1402
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,079
ass

1403
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,440
because you've got to make sure that

1404
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,800
your knowledge is up to scratch you've

1405
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,559
got to reset an exam you've got to go to

1406
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,240
prove that you're constantly being able

1407
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,839
to educate yourself

1408
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,040
on the other hand it's a really great

1409
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,119
idea because it forces you to keep up

1410
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,280
with industry knowledge it forces you to

1411
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,280
keep up with changing technology it

1412
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,800
forces you to demonstrate you haven't

1413
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,400
just passed an exam and then left it to

1414
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,720
moulder you've continued to educate

1415
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,559
yourself and you can demonstrate that by

1416
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,839
proving you've

1417
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,240
taken courses read books read articles

1418
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,119
whatever

1419
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,880
so

1420
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,319
annoying because i have to do it

1421
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,160
but at the same time good because it

1422
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,240
forces you to continually

1423
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
keep yourself at the

1424
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,599
cutting edge and continually keep

1425
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
yourself abreast of of changes in

1426
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,559
education and things

1427
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,319
all right we've got time for one last

1428
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,359
question there we go lucky last iceberg

1429
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,880
c won't actually let me sit for the

1430
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,280
cissp just by meeting all the

1431
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,559
requirements

1432
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,760
can you recommend something that's

1433
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,000
equivalent

1434
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,319
equivalent but different i would say the

1435
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,079
uh sans gisp

1436
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,160
i i would put that firmly as equivalent

1437
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,839
to the cis

1438
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,760
like i said there's issues about

1439
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,640
visibility um

1440
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,920
but

1441
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,839
if if for whatever reason you're being

1442
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,440
blocked from actually taking the cis

1443
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,559
exam go for the sans ones they people

1444
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,400
who do know them have a good reputation

1445
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
and if people don't know them it's an

1446
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,520
opportunity for you in an interview or

1447
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,960
when talking to people to say look you

1448
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,640
know there were some issues with isc i

1449
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,400
couldn't take the cis so i took the sans

1450
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,079
one instead here's here's the

1451
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,240
equivalence of it

1452
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,839
all right i'd go down that route

1453
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,680
right we've run out of time all right

1454
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,960
