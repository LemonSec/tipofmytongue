00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
new venue some of the same old some of

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
the new it's been fantastic

10
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,280
if you have input you have thoughts

11
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
email them to feedback at hope.net we'd

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
love to hear about your experience

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
the organizing committee does track this

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
stuff we also route it and share it with

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
people that might need to know the good

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
the bad the ugly the suggestions

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
anything like that so we do value all

18
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,759
that input

19
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
some people might have heard already

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
just i'll repeat a little bit we do have

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
a change from the printed program

22
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
schedule if you're interested in the

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
simulcast closing ceremonies we're not

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
going to do that here we'll do it in

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,119
room 206 that just helps you know focus

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
on d'angelo for the end of the day so

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,000
that's at 6 pm closing ceremonies after

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
the closing ceremonies there's going to

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
be a band a salsa brazilian salsa band

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,599
of some sort uh start up right outside

31
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,200
closing ceremonies i'll do sort of a

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
procession through the building end up

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,120
out front of d'angelo building it'll be

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
a little bit of a you know street party

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
type of atmosphere i think so that

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
sounds pretty cool so if you were

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
thinking of leaving early

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,640
maybe you should consider changing your

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
plans stick around a little bit longer

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
and if you want to stick around even

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,640
longer we really need and value

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
volunteers

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
excuse me volunteers for packing up and

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
helping load those trucks cleaning up

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
the venue things like that uh that work

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
tends to be somewhat heavy but there's

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
also a lot of work that's not so heavy

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
like just you know cleaning up signs and

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
and straightening up a couple of things

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,920
so please do stick around if you can for

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
cleanup that usually goes all the way

52
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
until midnight or so

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,280
and doesn't require any particular

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
skills so that's

55
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
partially in this room but mostly it's

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
up in d'angelo and

57
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
last thing about that volunteers is we

58
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,200
also have to load up a bunch of trucks

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
tomorrow morning so if you happen to

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
still be on campus right around nine

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
o'clock or so in the morning or if you

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
can come back to campus sometime between

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
9 and 12 is when those trucks pick up

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
otherwise it's a hot day today again so

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
don't forget to drink just because

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
you've done well on hydration all the

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
way till now it doesn't mean that uh you

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
know that you're tanked up for sunday so

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
a lot of a lot of liquids that's it from

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
me let's turn it over to rob cohen and

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080
hear all about hacking the sat welcome

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,670
rob

73
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,790
[Applause]

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,799
thank you um

75
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
i do see some younger people out there

76
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,680
so this isn't just a passing curiosity

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
maybe and some practical uh applications

78
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,920
so

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
i am rob cohen and i will be talking

80
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,840
about hacking the sat all right

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
um

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,959
did i get unplugged from the

83
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
it wasn't there yeah

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,239
maybe just

85
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
unplug it and replug

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,920
it hmm

87
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
all right

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
go figure

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
suffering from technology at a

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
conference full of techies here we go

91
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,320
let's try this again so yes my name is

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
rob cohen hacking the s.a.t here we go

93
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
so

94
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
i'll start with just um

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,680
who i am but the meat of the talk will

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
be about

97
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,199
kind of backdoor methods and

98
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
exploiting various vulnerabilities that

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
exist in multiple choice tests in

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
general i'll be using the sat

101
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,880
specifically to talk about that and

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
i'll provide some context for where the

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
sat is at

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
regarding

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
college admissions in the future and if

106
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
i can get through that in time hopefully

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
some questions from you guys

108
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,120
without further ado so who am i my um

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
little disclaimer at the beginning here

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
is

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
i don't like these tests okay i didn't

112
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
like them as a student i don't like them

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
as an educator i feel there's not a

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,840
perfect venn diagram fit between

115
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,919
a standardized test

116
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
assessment and the knowledge that it's

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
purporting to cover

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
so i'm not here to apologize or

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
cheerlead for these tests in any way so

120
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
how did i get into this space in the

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
first place

122
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
my path to education i graduated from a

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
small liberal arts school with a math

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
and music degree

125
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
and

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
was interested in coming to new york

127
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,919
city

128
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,360
to

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
pursue

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
a possible career as a musician and

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,759
found an organization called math for

132
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
america that was seeking to recruit

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
people with high

134
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
level knowledge of mathematics that

135
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
weren't necessarily heading into the

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
educational space to get them into

137
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,759
public schools in new york city

138
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
i got my master's in math education and

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
nyu through that program

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
and taught at a music and arts school in

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
brooklyn

142
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
and

143
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
realized that the

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,639
the dream of being come some sort of

145
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,880
non-rock star because i play weird music

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,319
it was uh

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
getting further in the distance and i

148
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,759
wanted to focus on that so i left the

149
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
classroom to focus on music and needed

150
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,479
some way to keep the lights on other

151
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,960
than like i said the esoteric music that

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
wasn't doing that so

153
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
i started tutoring and as a math tutor i

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
quickly found myself in a situation

155
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
where i'd be working with a high school

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
age student and the parents would like

157
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
the work i was doing and say hey they're

158
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
taking the sats this fall can you help

159
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
with the math section of that so i kind

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,560
of got into that space and

161
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
quickly realized okay this is another

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
service i can offer but people don't

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
necessarily want to hire half of an sat

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
tutor so i looked at the verbal half and

165
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,960
kind of kind of

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
re-rent through a bunch of tests and

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
disassembled what was going on there to

168
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,000
a place where i felt like i could

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
understand it and communicate so

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
fast forward

171
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
i was leaving the music space to enter

172
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,000
more of this tutoring company that i

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
built up from the ground and now i'm

174
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
hiring and training other tutors as well

175
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
and i just want to share quickly before

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
we get into

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
some of the specific techniques that

178
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
i've come to over the years

179
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,879
a bit of a epiphany i had in sat

180
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,440
tutoring where i was working with

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
a student that was

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
not particularly

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
say adept at

184
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
math fundamentals i was coming to him as

185
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
a math tutor

186
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,960
and i knew his foundations were weak and

187
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,160
we were getting into sat tutoring

188
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
and we were about to get into this

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
problem which i quickly realized would

190
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
take

191
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,759
the end

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,199
it would take us through the end of the

193
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
lesson for me to

194
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
get into the concept that was involved

195
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
in this particular question

196
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
not only that

197
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,000
it occurred to me that it was pretty

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
unlikely that

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
that understanding would get to a place

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
where this student would be able to use

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,279
it again in any sort of repeatable way

202
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,120
and time is a premium when you're in

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
this test prep space i'm usually seeing

204
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,480
a student for one hour a week so

205
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,399
the lipo moment was

206
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
well wait a second

207
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
this particular question you don't need

208
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,120
to understand the concept at all because

209
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
there's this other way of looking at it

210
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
and that sort of blew my mind open to

211
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
thinking about the

212
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
test questions for what they were and

213
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
that the path to get to the right answer

214
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
was irrelevant as long as you ended up

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
at the destination which is b

216
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
c or d right um

217
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,360
and i let go my pride as a math teacher

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
of like kind of wanting my students to

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
understand some of this material and

220
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,279
like okay that's fine if i'm working

221
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
with them as a math tutor that a deeper

222
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
understanding probably is important but

223
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,160
as an sat student

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
it's just a score that they're trying to

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
hit and

226
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
i was able to

227
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
open my mind to various approaches that

228
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
would

229
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
allow the

230
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,320
students abilities to dictate where they

231
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
were headed in terms of finding the

232
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
answer

233
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
and just before we start some brief

234
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
notes about the presentation

235
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
like i said most of you are

236
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
not young people for whom this test is

237
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
relevant but

238
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,440
the sat can be used as a proxy for any

239
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,959
sort of multiple choice standardized

240
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,560
test in general there's plenty of

241
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
professional exams and you know if

242
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
you're entering the graduate student

243
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
place so

244
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
we live in a world where standardized

245
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
testing is

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,519
somewhat ubiquitous um

247
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,959
and

248
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
when i was originally preparing for this

249
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
talk i wanted to provide some history

250
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
and context for

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
where the s.a.t came from and how it

252
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
evolved over the years and

253
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,800
parallel to that

254
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,440
the test prep industry and

255
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
my first kind of rehearsal of this talk

256
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
involved just one slide full of notes

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
that i've come to and found that i was

258
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
like over 30 40 minutes and i hadn't

259
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,560
gotten to any of the hacks yet so um i

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
can get to some of that history in the q

261
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
a or after the talk if anyone's

262
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
interested but all i'll say for now

263
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,200
that's totally relevant to the talk is

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
for those older members of the audience

265
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,640
that took the test say before 2016 the

266
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
sat today is a much different test than

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,920
the one you're familiar with

268
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
the verbal half of the test still

269
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
includes reading comprehension which i'm

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
sure most of you remember you read a

271
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,800
passage and then answer some questions

272
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,240
on it

273
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
there used to be

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
sort of vocabulary driven

275
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,200
logic game sentence completion analogies

276
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
and and whatnot that's all gone and has

277
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,959
been replaced by

278
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,240
sort of grammar and usage questions um

279
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
understanding how

280
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
a given phrase or a sentence serves a

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
text

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
the math there's still half of the test

283
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,079
that's math um

284
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,760
again before 2016 the math content was

285
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
more on the ends of pre-algebra algebra

286
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,680
one and some geometry that's all still

287
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,720
there

288
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,600
but

289
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
there's i would say less geometry

290
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
covered on the current version of the

291
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,079
test and a lot more emphasis on

292
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,079
more advanced algebra algebra beyond

293
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
algebra one so knowledge of quadratics

294
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
and things that you would find in

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
algebra two in precalculus now creeping

296
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,959
in the test

297
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,639
in previous incarnations of the test you

298
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
could be very clever

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
and

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
not necessarily have paid a lot of

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
tension in math class and do pretty well

302
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
on the math section

303
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
now you kind of have to be clever and

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
have paid somewhat attention in math

305
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
class

306
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
all the examples that you're going to

307
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
see on the slides come from

308
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
the college board's official practice

309
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,480
tests that are available online for

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
anybody to see

311
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
and please hold questions to the end

312
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
let's get started

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
so the first hack is not a hack so much

314
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
as

315
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
just

316
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,279
knowing what the test is comprised of

317
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,040
and having that dictate your study

318
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
so

319
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
what i did is i looked at like i

320
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,639
mentioned the college board has released

321
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
a bunch of practice tests but not only

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
that there's some laws specifically in

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
new york state and california

324
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
um around 1980

325
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,560
called truth and testing laws that

326
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
required

327
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
standardized tests

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,399
operating in those states to release

329
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
questions so that people could see what

330
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
was on the test the result of that is

331
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,639
that

332
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,040
periodically throughout the year

333
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
tests like the sat and the act are

334
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
forced to kind of share with the people

335
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
that pay for these tests

336
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,279
they're actual copies so you get your

337
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,839
answer sheet and the actual test book we

338
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,800
live in

339
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
this

340
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
information age and invariably copies of

341
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
those tests end up online and anybody in

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,639
the test prep space

343
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,480
knows how to access them and that's kind

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
of what informs our study so

345
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,360
what i did is

346
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
i build out a spreadsheet that would

347
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
analyze i started with the math and i'm

348
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,720
still kind of working my way through

349
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
this but question by question

350
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
what was on a given problem in terms of

351
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
its category type so i'll just show you

352
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,399
a screenshot of this tool and i'm hoping

353
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
to work with my brother-in-law to build

354
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
this out into an app that i can just

355
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
kind of release online as a study tool

356
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,560
for students where

357
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
they can kind of pinpoint and prioritize

358
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
their study based on you know what's

359
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
important what are they likely to see on

360
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,399
the test and

361
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,600
focus on just the high likelihood

362
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
categories first and then you know for

363
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,120
top scorers of course you're trying to

364
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
get everything you can then you can

365
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,519
worry about some of these like

366
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,760
less than likely or almost never likely

367
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
to occur

368
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
questions so i want to give just two

369
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
examples of how

370
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,959
knowing a specific content area can just

371
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,639
unlock a question so there's there's

372
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
certain examples of content that's just

373
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
it's so easy it's a few minute

374
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,920
conversation with a student you know

375
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
this rule it will translate to a

376
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,519
question that you're guaranteed to see

377
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,760
on the uh test i'm going to give a a

378
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,279
verbal example and a math example so

379
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
the verbal example relates to dangling

380
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
modifiers excuse me while i put this

381
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,600
little michael jackson glove on here to

382
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
work my writing tablet

383
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
if you're not familiar with what a

384
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
dangling modifier is it

385
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
basically boils down to this if you

386
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
start a sentence with a descriptive

387
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,959
phrase that is left hanging in that it

388
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,480
doesn't mention what it's referring to

389
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
the next word after the comma needs to

390
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
be the noun or the person that it

391
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
describes so this is the kind of

392
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
boilerplate example i give to all my

393
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
students when i'm doing this

394
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
having

395
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,639
forgotten

396
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,880
to study

397
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,040
comma you would think since i'm a

398
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,519
teacher that better handwriting but alas

399
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,800
um

400
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
the test

401
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
was impossible

402
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
all right so

403
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,920
the problem with this mistake is that it

404
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,519
doesn't sound like a mistake unless

405
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
you're familiar with the rule a lot of

406
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
grammar conventions kind of sound

407
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
awkward at least if you've been on the

408
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
planet and speaking and reading and

409
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,440
writing for long enough this sounds

410
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,839
somewhat natural again if you don't know

411
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,360
that this is something you're supposed

412
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
to avoid it's a mistake

413
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
you know people make

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
quite commonly in email correspondence

415
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
so

416
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,959
we have

417
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,399
having forgotten to study this

418
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
descriptive phrase at the beginning

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,759
again it's describing something or

420
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,839
someone well did the test forget to

421
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,199
study for the test of course not

422
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
somebody did so let's say that somebody

423
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,639
is john

424
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,880
his name would be the very next word

425
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
after that and i would need to kind of

426
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
tweak the sentence some more to go and

427
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,600
make it make sense john maybe you know

428
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,560
found the test to be impossible

429
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,720
all right so let's look at an example of

430
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
this from an actual test

431
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,320
clear that

432
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
so the format is a little confusing if

433
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
you haven't seen the new sat you have a

434
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
kind of passage worth of writing going

435
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
down the left-hand column and then you

436
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
have the questions with these number

437
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
boxes that refer to parts of the text as

438
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
you go so i highlighted the sentence

439
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
which contains the problem we're looking

440
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
at so we can see the sentence believing

441
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
the home stories to be lowbrow work

442
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,400
comma instead well

443
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
who or what believed that a person kind

444
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,919
of needed to believe something right so

445
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
did a focus believe that no we can cross

446
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
out a

447
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
did a focusing believe that that doesn't

448
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
make sense did writing believe that no

449
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
he had to believe that so the power to

450
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
knowing this particular strategy is that

451
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
this can otherwise seem like waiting

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,520
through an arbitrary selection of text

453
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
but it's just do you know this rule or

454
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
not

455
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
a math example to take you back to math

456
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,039
class so

457
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
this is a formula that's beaten over the

458
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
heads of most people that survive middle

459
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,360
school and high school math

460
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
linear equations

461
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,919
now

462
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,880
unlike

463
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,799
other tests that might

464
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,360
just say can you manipulate and and show

465
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
that you know how to operate this

466
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
equation the sat in this

467
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
current version at least

468
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
tests this in in an interpretation term

469
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
so they'll give you a word problem that

470
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,840
involves a linear equation and then see

471
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,880
if you can understand how it models

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
something so again

473
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
most of my students coming to me even

474
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
very weak math students

475
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,679
know this formula if not know how to use

476
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,480
it

477
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
and they're familiar with the fact that

478
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,640
b

479
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,400
is the y-intercept and m is the slope

480
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
and the slope formula is another thing

481
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
they're beating over the head with

482
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,480
they're taught that slope is rise over

483
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,919
run

484
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,160
or

485
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
rate of change in y over x um more

486
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
sophisticated some just know the words

487
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
and then don't know the formula but if

488
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
they do know that it's the difference in

489
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
y over difference of x then

490
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,679
we can get to okay well how do you

491
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
interpret the y-intercept and the slope

492
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
if it comes up in a word problem that

493
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
involves a linear equation so the

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,720
y-intercept again which they're kind of

495
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
sight trained to recognize in a formula

496
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,200
is going to be the starting condition

497
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
for whatever y is

498
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
and the slope in terms of interpreting

499
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
it as a

500
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
number and like linguistic concept

501
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
we have this change in y over change of

502
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
x well it's not too much of a stretch

503
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,400
once you know that it's y over x to say

504
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
that it would be kind of the

505
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
change

506
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
in units

507
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,720
of y

508
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,120
over one unit change of x so

509
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,720
i'll show you a quick problem that

510
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
relates to just

511
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
you see the linear equation and you can

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
just immediately pick out the answer all

513
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
right

514
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,919
again for those of you who took older

515
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,160
versions of this test the um the math

516
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
section is a lot wordier than it used to

517
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,200
be

518
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
um there's reading comprehension so i've

519
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,039
i've worked with strong math students

520
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
that are weak readers that just get

521
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,720
dinged on questions because they can't

522
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,520
follow the like you know again the

523
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
semantic end of things all right so we

524
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,679
see

525
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
something

526
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
that we can recognize as linear

527
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,240
we have this y equals mx plus b format

528
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
with different

529
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
letters and then numbers for m and b

530
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
they're saying what is 1.8 mean in this

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
context well

532
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
that's the slope and what did we say the

533
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
slope is

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
kind of units of y per one unit of x so

535
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,919
if we just go down the answers

536
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
we just need to remember that y is

537
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,200
represented by h in this equation and x

538
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,320
by l so we're looking for something that

539
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,960
says kind of

540
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,360
1.88 well what does h stand for it's the

541
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
height of an adult male so 1.8 inches

542
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
of somebody's height a male's height per

543
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,799
1 inch of what is l represent the femur

544
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
length so 1 inch of femur length

545
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
again the strength of kind of knowing

546
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
how these questions work is that we

547
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,799
don't need to like wrap ourselves in

548
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
logical loops here and go on endless

549
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
searches and try and get confused like

550
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,520
we're looking for this okay the 32.01 is

551
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
irrelevant to this discussion so those

552
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,240
are gone and now we see c the

553
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
approximate increase in a femur length

554
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
well that's upside down right we want

555
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,240
the increase in height per femur length

556
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
so c is kind of trying to trick us and

557
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
there we go the approximate increase of

558
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
man's height for each one inch increase

559
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
and again

560
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,799
it's easy to be a strong math student

561
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,240
and no linear equations work and still

562
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,159
get a question like this wrong so

563
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,760
two examples of just you know this

564
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,400
content boom you're getting 10 20 points

565
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,200
on the test from that alone all right

566
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
second hack

567
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,679
relates to plugging in now there's two

568
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,400
areas in which this is applicable guess

569
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,559
and check and and something i'm gonna

570
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,720
more specifically call plugging in i'm

571
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,159
sure anybody that's ever taken a

572
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
standardized test is familiar with guess

573
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
and check like if you're kind of in

574
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,679
doubt or something just go through the

575
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
answers if it's solving an equation see

576
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
which one works right so

577
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
that one's

578
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
fairly self-explanatory um plugging in

579
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,120
was uh something that i kind of

580
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
realized the power of only within the

581
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,799
past like few years i've been doing this

582
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,360
for almost 15 years now but

583
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,679
i realized just how powerful it was as a

584
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,799
tool so

585
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
essentially what this does is it deals

586
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,360
with math problem types that

587
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,000
are asking about relationships those

588
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
could be algebraic relationships

589
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,720
geometric relationships and maybe okay

590
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
if we change these quantities in such a

591
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
way what is the result of that behavior

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,399
and

593
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
if this works in a general case it works

594
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
for the specifics so all you need to do

595
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,760
to answer these sort of abstract

596
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,919
questions is just pin them down to the

597
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,320
easiest specific case

598
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,919
and if it works in that case it works

599
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,600
for all the cases

600
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,559
so you can for example turn what would

601
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
be a difficult algebra problem into an

602
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
easy arithmetic problem so

603
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,200
first let's look at guess and check

604
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
we'll

605
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,640
very quickly just kind of see how we can

606
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,440
again not not to solve an equation but

607
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,240
just

608
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
see what works so the up and down lines

609
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
on each side of the n minus one absolute

610
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
value makes everything positive we would

611
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
just go through the motions and see

612
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,799
which one works so

613
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,480
does that equal zero well that's

614
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
negative one the absolute value of

615
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,600
negative one is one one plus one does

616
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
not equal zero so that's gone does

617
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
one

618
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
minus one plus one well that's zero plus

619
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
one that doesn't equal zero does two

620
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,679
minus one equal 0 no that's 1 plus 1

621
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
equals 2. so

622
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,520
something else to mention from this

623
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,799
technique is

624
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,600
for multiple choice questions you don't

625
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
need to know

626
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
why the answer works like i don't need

627
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,559
to know that there was no value i just

628
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,159
know that a b and c didn't work that's

629
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,760
all i need to know if i can eliminate

630
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,279
three answers and there's four choices

631
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,200
i've gotten the answer i don't need to

632
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,480
understand anything i don't need to

633
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
explain my work

634
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
you can

635
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,559
sometimes use guess and check

636
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,200
on word problems even so

637
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,799
there are some math questions that

638
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
aren't multiple choice on the test and

639
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
if we look at this one here um doug and

640
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,880
lara spent a combined 250 hours in the

641
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,080
tutoring lab if doug spent 40 hours more

642
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,919
in the lab than laura did how many hours

643
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,559
did laura spend in the lab well one way

644
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
to approach a problem like this is just

645
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
kind of deal with certain constraints

646
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,960
and then tweak it from there so we have

647
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
doug and lara and let's say we're

648
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
tracking the difference in their time so

649
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,080
one way to just approach this with guess

650
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
and check say again if you're not a

651
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,840
strong algebra student and that's not

652
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
your bag you could say well let me just

653
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,440
split it in half 125 125 that's no

654
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,039
difference and i know i'm dealing with

655
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,039
250 hours so that's my starting

656
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,919
condition i need this

657
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,039
to be 40 not 0. so i can just say well

658
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
doug spent more time let me just find

659
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
increments and add till i get there

660
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,760
let's try adding 5. so that's 130 and

661
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
120 for a difference of 10 well i'm

662
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,159
getting somewhere right

663
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,080
i could try 10 now 140 and then 10 off

664
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,520
110 and that's a difference of 30. all

665
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,919
right so i mean again you don't need to

666
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,240
be a math genius to get there i'll just

667
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
jump to the answer here so 145 105 for a

668
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,039
difference of 40. but again a weaker

669
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
math student could kind of plot through

670
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
that at a store slower pace and end up

671
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
with 105 hours for laura

672
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,120
plugging in

673
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,559
so

674
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,400
this particular problem in terms of

675
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,240
placement comes from a test this would

676
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
have been the

677
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,640
last multiple choice question on the no

678
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
calculator portion of the exam so

679
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
traditionally the last two or three

680
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
questions are what the college board is

681
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
going to consider the more difficult the

682
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
most different difficult multiple choice

683
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,799
problems the particular content that

684
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
this question is testing is

685
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
um polynomial division which there's

686
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,640
other you know shortcuts for there's

687
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
synthetic division or um a number of

688
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
things but again

689
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
what we're being asked

690
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
is here here's an expression this

691
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,039
rational expression and it's equivalent

692
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,600
meaning the same as one of these below

693
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
so the hallmark of these problems is

694
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,799
when you're looking at abcd if you see

695
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,080
that they are at least partially if not

696
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
all expressions that's usually a sign

697
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,720
that you can just fix a value to the

698
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
variable in the expression um i know how

699
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,760
to do this the quote unquote right way

700
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,520
and i would still do it the way i'm

701
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,159
about to show you so let's take the

702
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,760
easiest possible number we can think of

703
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,919
the easiest one i can think of is zero

704
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,559
and then this becomes zero minus two

705
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
over zero plus three so we get negative

706
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
two thirds the correct answer

707
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,240
when we plug in zero below we'll also

708
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,919
say negative two thirds we can see a and

709
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,440
b don't even

710
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
relate to x and five minus two

711
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,600
is three over three well that's not

712
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,279
negative two thirds

713
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,440
five minus two thirds so i do work with

714
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,039
plenty of students that have like

715
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,000
fraction phobia but i think most of them

716
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
realize that five minus two-thirds is

717
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,480
not negative two-thirds that's gone and

718
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,799
then this is also five minus two-thirds

719
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
that's gone again

720
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
we don't need to know and have the

721
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,159
fraction expertise to recognize that 5

722
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,480
minus 17 thirds is in fact negative

723
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,399
two-thirds because we've eliminated

724
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,600
everything else

725
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,918
all right

726
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,159
and just one note on

727
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,279
that strategy relating to algebraic

728
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,480
content

729
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
and word problems and so many different

730
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,760
types so like

731
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
where i'm at with that sort of

732
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,679
spreadsheet analysis of question types

733
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
right now

734
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
we're looking at like

735
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,039
over 15 of all math questions on the sat

736
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,559
can be just

737
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,360
straight up gamed with that level of

738
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,440
plugging in thinking of simple examples

739
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,760
if it's a percentage problem deal with a

740
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,399
hundred right if it's an algebra problem

741
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,480
zero one two like whatever is easiest

742
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,559
for the circumstance there that's one in

743
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
six to one and seven questions that you

744
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
don't need to know whatever they're

745
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,279
asking maybe plugging in is longer than

746
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,240
knowing the quote unquote right way but

747
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
it'll get you there um

748
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
so the next hack just so i don't

749
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,399
completely neglect the reading

750
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
comprehension portion of the exam

751
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
is one type of question that's on the

752
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,360
newer version of the test that wasn't

753
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
there initially

754
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,120
um and that

755
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,799
looks like this below so we can see

756
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,200
question 37 says which choice provides

757
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,640
the best evidence for the answer to the

758
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,279
previous question all right well

759
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,679
this is like a package deal right if i

760
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,200
get 36 wrong i'm more than likely to get

761
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
37 wrong because now i'm providing

762
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
evidence for something that was

763
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,679
incorrect um so i'll bring up the text

764
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
here

765
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,480
we see

766
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
a passage from virginia woolf 1938 so

767
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,279
this is

768
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,159
a type of text the s.a.t

769
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,960
will throw one at least passage of

770
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,640
somewhat antiquated english so we're

771
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,320
dealing with a text that's almost 100

772
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,480
years old this would be difficult for

773
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
most of my students to just follow the

774
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
thread of and understand english of this

775
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,159
nature so

776
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
that's a chore and of itself

777
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,640
i've highlighted

778
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,679
the

779
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,520
answer choices and the lines that they

780
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
go with so

781
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
the question that we're trying to

782
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,159
support in this particular example wolf

783
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
indicates that the procession she

784
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,000
describes in the passage well does one

785
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,919
of these things abcd and we're trying to

786
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,320
support it below so

787
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,159
i'm just gonna read from the last

788
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,159
sentence here now we are here to

789
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,159
consider facts now we must fix our eyes

790
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,080
upon the procession the procession of

791
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,799
the sons of educated men all right so

792
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,880
she mentions this procession and then

793
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,200
the answer choice again

794
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
is going to be supported by one of these

795
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,880
lines so let's start with a the first

796
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
one because we'll get context as we go

797
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
and if we can rule out where the answer

798
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
isn't it'll make it easier to select the

799
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,480
answer in 36 some questions lend

800
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,840
themselves better

801
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
to this technique than others

802
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
there they go our brothers who have been

803
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
educated at public schools and

804
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
universities mounting those steps

805
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,440
passing in and out of those doors

806
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,039
ascending those pulpits preaching

807
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,720
teaching administering justice

808
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
practicing medicine transacting business

809
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
making money okay

810
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,919
so

811
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,080
does that indicate that this procession

812
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,880
has come to have more of a practical

813
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
influence in recent years not really

814
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,440
does it indicate that the procession has

815
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,039
become a celebrated feature of english

816
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,200
public life that also seems somewhat

817
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
irrelevant it's like

818
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
talking about people going to work

819
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,279
does it include all of the richest and

820
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,720
most powerful men in england now i've

821
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
had plenty of students when i'm going

822
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,919
through this example with them tell me

823
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,399
yes it does because they see okay

824
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
administering justice practicing

825
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
medicine yeah judges lawyers doctors

826
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
they're pretty rich and powerful right

827
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,240
well

828
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,919
there's two problems with that the first

829
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,799
problem is it includes all of the

830
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
richest and most powerful men in england

831
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,919
so there's plenty of rich and powerful

832
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,320
people that aren't doctors and lawyers

833
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,360
another thing about that word all

834
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
unrelated to this type of problem is

835
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,399
that

836
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,320
in reading comprehension problems i

837
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
always direct my students to be very

838
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,919
wary of any absolute language all never

839
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,519
always these are almost always hallmarks

840
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,840
not i say almost always almost always

841
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,080
hallmarks of incorrect trap answers um

842
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,960
the nature of thought and expression is

843
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,360
such that it's very hard to say anything

844
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,519
in absolute certainty and so absolute

845
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
certainty is something that the test

846
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,640
makers rely on to undermine what

847
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,919
otherwise would be a correct answer so

848
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,960
we can

849
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,640
kind of get rid of this answer choice

850
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
without even thinking about the other

851
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,399
lines and the connections but another

852
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,519
problem is

853
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,320
there are other professions mentioned in

854
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
this set of lines that aren't doctors

855
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
and lawyers and we're talking about say

856
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,159
teachers well i came from the teaching

857
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,399
profession and i don't know anyone that

858
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,840
would describe teachers as rich and

859
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,559
powerful in this society

860
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,840
so

861
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,799
we've

862
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,679
gotten a b c out and then let's look at

863
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,559
d again does a support this is the kind

864
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,399
of game we're playing and forgive me if

865
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,720
i'm going a little fast

866
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
so has this procession become less

867
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
exclusionary in membership in recent

868
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,039
years that line doesn't seem to indicate

869
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,600
any of those so now a is out and i'm

870
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
focusing and getting a narrow view on

871
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,799
where the answer could possibly be b

872
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,960
is pretty brief it is a solemn site

873
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,799
always a procession like a care of an rc

874
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,600
crossing in desert well i now have these

875
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,399
answer choices for 36 fresh in my mind

876
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
and that brief little sentence doesn't

877
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,159
really seem to have anything to do with

878
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
any of them so we can

879
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,799
generally speaking get rid of one bad

880
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,960
answer in a test question at least

881
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
without too much knowledge so that's

882
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,200
just you know probably not too many

883
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,559
people picking uh b on 37 there

884
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,120
now we notice this little gap here and

885
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,519
sometimes these evidence support

886
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,799
questions are kind of sprinkled

887
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,080
throughout sometimes they're closely

888
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
clustered together one thing i tell my

889
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,000
students in these sort of scavenger hunt

890
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,880
approaches to these problems is

891
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
a given line item that is a support to a

892
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,279
question can carry echoes of preceding

893
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,480
text so

894
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,799
we shouldn't just skip over again if

895
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,559
we're doing this we probably read the

896
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,399
passage already the whole thing but for

897
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,320
now yeah i'm just kind of going line by

898
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,679
line

899
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,760
but there could be echoes of what was

900
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,559
just said that's important so it makes

901
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,320
this kind of tricky until you're used to

902
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,640
that sort of thing um but now for the

903
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,399
past 20 years or so it is no longer a

904
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,559
site again that procession

905
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,320
a photograph for fresco scrawled upon

906
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
the walls of time at which we can look

907
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
at with merely an aesthetic appreciation

908
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,079
for their traipsing along at the tail

909
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,560
end of the procession we go ourselves

910
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,679
well

911
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
you need to kind of understand the

912
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,320
context of

913
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,079
who is um virginia woolf addressing here

914
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,040
and

915
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
the test was nice enough to tell us that

916
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
she's talking to the women in english

917
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,639
society so

918
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
what what is this procession again the

919
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
sons of educated men are going to work

920
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,639
essentially and now we go ourselves so

921
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,719
let's see if that line supports one of

922
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,918
these well

923
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
that procession has come to have more

924
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,520
practical influence still seems

925
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,399
irrelevant a celebrated feature still

926
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,839
seems irrelevant all the rich and

927
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,839
powerful men that's just gone as we

928
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,280
addressed and then

929
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
has become less exclusionary and

930
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,040
membership over recent years so

931
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,440
now women are entering educated spaces

932
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
and getting these professional jobs that

933
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,599
at once were only available to men so we

934
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,359
have c supporting d and we kind of

935
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,839
answered them as a pair

936
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,520
whenever my students are doing reading

937
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,839
comprehension i always tell them glance

938
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,760
at the next question don't be caught off

939
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
guard that this is

940
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,200
going to ask you to support the next one

941
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
because you can deal with them in pairs

942
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
like we just did

943
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
all right

944
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
onwards

945
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,839
the next hack relates to graphing

946
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
calculators so

947
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,640
before we get to that again the older

948
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
members of my audience here you know

949
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
like me when we took the test we were

950
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
allowed a

951
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,720
four function calculator or maybe a

952
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,760
scientific calculator um

953
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,680
scientific calculators can do log sine

954
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
cosine tangent but almost none of that

955
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
was on the test anyway so that was kind

956
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
of irrelevant

957
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
students today can use graphing

958
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,079
calculators on the current version of

959
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,320
the test um

960
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,599
they're expensive they cost 100 200 and

961
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,359
you know not everybody can afford to get

962
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
them and even if a student does have

963
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
them maybe they're in a school district

964
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
where their math teacher doesn't have a

965
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
set for the class or even if they do

966
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
they haven't been trained in how to you

967
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
know

968
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,880
talk about how to use the graphing

969
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
calculator graphing calculators a

970
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,800
computer so you know at a place like

971
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
this you should appreciate the power of

972
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,680
that i'll just show you kind of one

973
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
stock thing um

974
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
that i show most of my students that

975
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,240
they're unaware of

976
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,760
these things can do you know they might

977
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,480
be kind of limitedly aware of the

978
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800
graphing functionality of the calculator

979
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,040
but say a student is

980
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
weak in fractions

981
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,119
you can just input numbers as fractions

982
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,480
you don't need to rely on division or

983
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
anything like that so i can just kind of

984
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,359
deal with one half as a number and not

985
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,400
have to worry about my order of

986
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,920
operations the calculator will take care

987
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,000
of all of that another

988
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,320
useful feature is

989
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
using the store function

990
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,560
so i can just kind of assign one half to

991
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,400
the variable button this x button up

992
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,000
here or i could just use the alphabet

993
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,599
and use any letter i can have any number

994
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,200
of variables but let's just say i do it

995
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
here and now i have

996
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,160
whenever i in this screen

997
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
type with x the calculator is going to

998
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
know to treat it as one-half so if we're

999
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,400
doing one of those uh plug-in problems

1000
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
that we looked at before

1001
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,359
let me just copy an expression here so

1002
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,640
let's say

1003
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
our test case for some reason needed to

1004
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,079
involve one half or it was just as

1005
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,920
simple as what is f of one half and

1006
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,599
we're plugging it into this uh

1007
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,320
expression well now when i hit enter the

1008
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
calculator will just do the computation

1009
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
as if x was one-half

1010
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,040
something else to say about the

1011
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
calculator

1012
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,040
portion and using the calculator to hack

1013
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,560
the test is

1014
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,440
in the college board's

1015
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,599
sort of calculator use policy there are

1016
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,440
no restrictions on supplemental software

1017
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,640
which kind of blew my mind

1018
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
you know it doesn't take too much

1019
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
imagination to think what you could put

1020
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,320
on a graphing calculator when i was a

1021
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
student i mainly used it to play tetris

1022
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,560
and ignore my math teacher but you can

1023
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,240
put equation solvers and just records of

1024
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,960
any equations or formulas that you might

1025
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,320
need to reference throughout the test

1026
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
like there are no restrictions and only

1027
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,119
imagination can dictate um there's

1028
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,240
communities online where kids discuss

1029
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,640
what stuff to put on your calculator um

1030
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
a publisher of a book that i use makes a

1031
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,520
sweet and and just disseminates it to

1032
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,320
people that buy it so if we look at um

1033
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,960
just this quick example program here's

1034
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,560
panda sat

1035
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
and

1036
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,920
we quickly see just like again some

1037
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,599
equation solvers and ways of dealing

1038
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
with various things so

1039
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,119
it's it's kind of mind-blowing that

1040
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,839
they're allowed

1041
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,480
um so let's keep going

1042
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,880
all right

1043
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,079
back to

1044
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
the next hack which involves guessing so

1045
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,200
every year i have at least one student

1046
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,920
if not all of them that ask me okay

1047
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
let's assume that i have no idea we've

1048
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
just kind of exhausted everything that i

1049
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,920
know all the little tricks and i have no

1050
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,520
idea what to do with this problem what's

1051
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
the right letter to guess rob should i

1052
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,440
guess c and

1053
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,520
of course before we even get to

1054
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,280
answering that question

1055
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,119
like i was saying

1056
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,040
with very superficial knowledge we can

1057
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
generally eliminate an answer choice or

1058
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
two and so a one out of three or one out

1059
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
of two guess is much better than a one

1060
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
out of four right your your probability

1061
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,440
of guessing right

1062
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,320
is um is greater so that's the first

1063
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
thing the second thing is just to stay

1064
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
on math

1065
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
sometimes we can eliminate um wrong

1066
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
answers by just kind of looking at what

1067
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,119
the answers look like now again i

1068
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,440
wouldn't recommend the strategies i'm

1069
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,280
getting into now if you had the vagus

1070
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,480
idea of what you were doing these are

1071
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
just kind of if you're going and blind

1072
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and confused so

1073
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,599
one thing i tell my students if they're

1074
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,839
looking at a question they have no idea

1075
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,079
it's multiple choice and

1076
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,160
let's say b and c kind of look alike

1077
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,640
maybe one is the reciprocal of the other

1078
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,119
something like that well the test makers

1079
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,480
tend to want to trap you with commonly

1080
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,960
made mistakes and there might be a wrong

1081
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
answer that's sort of the red herring to

1082
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,599
get you to select that so if i see b and

1083
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,359
c look alike and a and d kind of look

1084
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,440
different i would say cross out a and d

1085
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,960
now it's a coin flip instead of a one

1086
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
out of four that could not get you

1087
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,200
anywhere but again this is assuming you

1088
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,480
had no idea what you were doing in the

1089
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
first place um

1090
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,119
another kind of just general math trick

1091
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,680
for eliminating answers is like if you

1092
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,400
see 120 as a coefficient in a given

1093
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,599
problem and 120 is also an answer choice

1094
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,280
probably not the answer they're probably

1095
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,119
just like oh that felt familiar let me

1096
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,880
go with that um

1097
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
again that could just as easily be wrong

1098
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
we're only relying on these when we have

1099
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,040
no idea what we're doing um okay so back

1100
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,800
to the question right should i guess c

1101
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
for whatever reason that seems to be the

1102
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,119
commonly agreed upon answer of what's

1103
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,319
the right thing to guess um

1104
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,640
so my initial response when i was

1105
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,480
pressed on this by students was that it

1106
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,839
doesn't matter there's a random

1107
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,640
distribution of answer choices um

1108
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,920
but

1109
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,000
one student and his mother

1110
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
both were kind of like really

1111
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,079
hard-pressing me on it one year and she

1112
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,720
was like well see he guessed c on these

1113
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
questions he ran out of time and and he

1114
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,480
didn't get any of them right i was like

1115
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
okay that you know unlikely things can

1116
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,079
happen with um probability but i thought

1117
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,960
about it a little more and and i had one

1118
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
insight where

1119
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,839
um

1120
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,960
maybe it wasn't um

1121
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,800
totally random in the sense that the

1122
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
questions they were running out of time

1123
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
on were the hard math questions again

1124
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
the test kind of gets progressively more

1125
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,319
difficult so they were running out of

1126
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,520
time towards the end maybe

1127
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
there was something less than random so

1128
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,079
i kind of again using all the tests that

1129
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,000
are available just looked at say the

1130
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,440
last five multiple choice answers to see

1131
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
if there was something possibly less

1132
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,760
than random going on um and i noticed

1133
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
something that was a little interesting

1134
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,400
first of all that well c was the least

1135
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,119
common answer choice in the um 30 or so

1136
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,319
tests i analyzed um about 16 so if we're

1137
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,079
guessing one out of four we would expect

1138
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,480
25 for all of them and then i saw d was

1139
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,119
more than twice as likely than than c at

1140
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,599
37 percent again

1141
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
this isn't a statistical case for

1142
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,800
anything that we've proven um it's just

1143
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,359
a little curiosity and so

1144
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,400
maybe the test makers are aware that

1145
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,480
more students are guessing c than others

1146
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,900
so

1147
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,079
[Music]

1148
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,520
yeah for my harder questions i'm not

1149
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
going to see the answer

1150
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,359
that could be happening

1151
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,480
i've

1152
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,319
you know no hard evidence to suspect

1153
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,839
that but it's possible

1154
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,640
and

1155
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
another kind of

1156
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,200
again from the test makers perspective

1157
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,599
reason why d might be the more likely

1158
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,200
one is that if i'm just kind of going

1159
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,520
through these sort of um brute force

1160
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,720
techniques

1161
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,680
and

1162
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,000
d is the last stop on my journey then by

1163
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,520
you know putting the correct answer d

1164
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
maybe they've slowed me down or

1165
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,359
something like that

1166
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,000
the last thing i'm going to discuss is a

1167
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,680
hack related to

1168
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
the environment in which the test is

1169
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,119
given so

1170
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,240
this is a timed test and

1171
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,400
certain students because of

1172
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,960
accommodations get extra time on these

1173
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,839
tests maybe you're dyslexic or have adhd

1174
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
or executive functioning issues any

1175
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
number of things that warranted a

1176
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,400
diagnosis at one point either by your

1177
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,440
school

1178
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,680
the special education program or a

1179
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,920
neuroscientist or something that says

1180
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,160
okay as far as the college board is

1181
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
considered you get extra time on this

1182
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,760
test well

1183
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,880
that's unfair for a couple reasons so

1184
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,960
the time limits themselves are

1185
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
necessarily unfair because they're just

1186
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,560
arbitrary gauntlets that penalize

1187
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,240
certain thinkers over others there's

1188
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,119
certain slow methodical thinkers that

1189
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,280
will struggle with time limit and others

1190
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,800
that don't and in the kind of who is

1191
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,280
given the extra time well again we're

1192
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,040
dealing with

1193
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,760
diagnosing

1194
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,720
neuropsychological behavioral things

1195
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,560
that are a little fuzzy

1196
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,119
inherently and so the people that get

1197
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,200
the extra time you know

1198
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,880
might not necessarily need it as much as

1199
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
some others so it's it's it's not a

1200
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,880
great

1201
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,280
system and i do sympathize with parents

1202
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
that you know kind of

1203
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
guarantee that their kid has some

1204
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,560
diagnosis but i am in no way like you

1205
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,280
know advocating fraud and lying um to

1206
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,599
get testing accommodations and

1207
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,119
you know i'm just putting a word of

1208
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,200
caution out there because the varsity

1209
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,640
blue scandal a few years back i don't

1210
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,040
know if you remember that um the fbi

1211
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,880
staying on sort of

1212
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
college admissions um

1213
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,680
kind of bogus tutors not really tutors

1214
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,400
but just people connected to coaches and

1215
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,760
things

1216
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
getting people that were otherwise

1217
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,599
unqualified to get exams a part of that

1218
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,359
scandal which i was unfamiliar with

1219
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,920
until researching for this talk um

1220
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,000
actually one of these guys

1221
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,280
was

1222
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,359
counseling his his students yeah like

1223
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
you know pay this neuroscientist fifteen

1224
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,720
thousand dollars and and you'll get the

1225
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,240
diagnosis make sure you get the extra

1226
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,000
time so that they'll have a little leg

1227
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,119
up on the sat or a ct

1228
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,640
so

1229
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,400
it's not a great system

1230
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,440
and

1231
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,800
the last thing i'll get into is the test

1232
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
and where it's at so

1233
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,800
um

1234
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,680
before covid which upended

1235
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,440
life as we know it also this test

1236
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,839
there was this trend in university

1237
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,480
college admissions towards test optional

1238
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
test flexible test blind let me just

1239
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
kind of quickly delineate what they are

1240
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
test optional is i can apply to a

1241
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,440
college and it's up to me to submit a

1242
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,400
score or not um again schools were doing

1243
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,240
that before kovit they were all forced

1244
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,480
to during covid because

1245
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,920
testing centers would be locked out

1246
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,520
state lockdowns rolling throughout the

1247
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,119
country certain students just didn't

1248
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,280
have an opportunity to take the test but

1249
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
take a competitive school like the

1250
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,720
university of chicago it announced it

1251
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,440
was test optional before kovid

1252
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,880
what does that mean does that mean it's

1253
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,920
easier to get in the university of

1254
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,400
chicago now of course not it just means

1255
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,440
if you're not going to submit test

1256
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,760
scores you better be excellent in the

1257
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,680
things that you are submitting

1258
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
test flexible means it's up to you what

1259
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,880
kind of test to submit you could submit

1260
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,640
an sat or an act but you could also

1261
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,520
submit say an sac subject test or

1262
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,760
an ap subject test

1263
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,640
a la carte kind of up to you test blind

1264
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,520
is

1265
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,400
student

1266
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,560
um can't even have the opportunity

1267
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,319
submit scores you know

1268
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,760
they won't look at them

1269
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,040
and

1270
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,400
an interesting develop in the past

1271
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,240
couple years kind of again indicating

1272
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,400
where the country may be headed is that

1273
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,359
the california the uc system the biggest

1274
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,319
state college network in the country um

1275
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,720
is now test blind like you cannot submit

1276
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,680
scores to uc you know pick berkeley

1277
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,839
santa barbara whatever

1278
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,640
so

1279
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,440
that's pretty significant

1280
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,400
the college board last year announced

1281
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,880
another complete re-haul of its test

1282
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,280
being rolled out 2023

1283
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,559
internationally a digital s.a.t so

1284
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,119
this talk is hacking the sat imagine

1285
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,000
literally hacking a digital sat um

1286
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,920
they're alleging that it'll be greater

1287
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,400
security but i'm skeptical we'll see

1288
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
what that looks like

1289
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,920
and that's kind of where we're headed so

1290
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,599
i think i do have

1291
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,359
a few minutes for questions if there are

1292
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,720
any from the audience and i'll be

1293
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,040
milling around in the back later

1294
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,599
but thank you

1295
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,160
[Applause]

1296
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
hi uh this talk was great and a little

1297
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,599
bit triggering for like high school

1298
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,960
memories

1299
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,920
um i'm curious like if you've seen you

1300
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,599
know like the college board and other

1301
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,160
like test writers reacting to these

1302
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,920
hacks and like changing their strategies

1303
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,839
like a little more than that like

1304
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,480
d is the more popular answer than c

1305
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,440
um

1306
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,800
so

1307
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,040
we're in a space now where there's like

1308
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,119
you know i'm doing this with my little

1309
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,280
boutique testing company and there's a

1310
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,839
thousand other companies where they're

1311
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,680
gonna have their own hacks and maybe

1312
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,440
even publishing books and and things

1313
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,920
like that and so um

1314
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,520
i think the only way in which the

1315
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,880
college board is is is responding if if

1316
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
they are is

1317
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,000
by just reinventing the test

1318
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,319
periodically and just like throwing away

1319
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,000
the whole thing and just like okay we'll

1320
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,240
now try this and then it's always just

1321
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,880
kind of this game they reinvent the test

1322
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,760
the test makers and the test prep people

1323
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,599
kind of disassemble it and figure it out

1324
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,119
and then they throw it out again and

1325
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,200
start over again like it might get to

1326
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,480
the point where the test is thrown out

1327
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
completely um

1328
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,400
that would be great i know i profit from

1329
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,839
it but i hate this thing so good

1330
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
riddance you know

1331
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,319
thanks yeah

1332
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,359
um

1333
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,480
i was curious so you mentioned something

1334
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,160
at the beginning about the history of

1335
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,000
sats

1336
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,440
what kind of

1337
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,720
um

1338
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,879
like

1339
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,200
what what kind of sparked them like like

1340
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,319
the need for sats like what

1341
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,760
why were they made

1342
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,280
so the the origin story is um

1343
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,839
the college board which now includes

1344
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,520
pretty much every college and university

1345
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,839
and in in like accredited colleges at

1346
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,920
least in in the country it was

1347
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,400
originally uh formed by like 12 colleges

1348
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,040
like 12 elite colleges some ivs some

1349
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,359
non-ivs like east coast schools

1350
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,240
and

1351
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,599
um

1352
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,240
this is the early 1900s where um

1353
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,319
unfortunately like eugenics was

1354
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,480
fashionable and intelligence tests were

1355
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,559
just lifting off the ground sort of kind

1356
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,760
of uh related to that interest and the

1357
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,720
um

1358
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,280
i believe the the original author of the

1359
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,280
sat that they were hired was eugene

1360
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,359
eugenesis but it was like kind of um

1361
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,839
the the reason they they had it was to

1362
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,440
like sort of cull

1363
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,720
the um

1364
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,920
applicant pool and then it kind of

1365
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,880
evolved to a place um that

1366
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,599
was at least supposed to be the opposite

1367
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,160
of that um in terms of

1368
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,040
creating a more meritocracy

1369
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,119
base for college admissions where okay

1370
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,040
this is an objective score that we can

1371
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,640
lean on and

1372
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,920
um

1373
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,880
you know access and things like that and

1374
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,400
and relationships among rich people

1375
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,200
don't matter as much necessarily um and

1376
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,280
then it's taken a long winding path uh

1377
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,359
from there

1378
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,400
hope i answered that

1379
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,400
hi hi excellent presentation um i was

1380
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
you 20 years ago had i guess what you're

1381
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,920
calling a boutique um sat prep program

1382
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,559
probably from 2005 to about 2015 before

1383
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,640
i retired um it's really great work

1384
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,240
you're doing but i do think your days

1385
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,680
are numbered i think that at a certain

1386
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,720
point they're going to phase out the

1387
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
test and bring something else in but a

1388
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,079
specific question um to you

1389
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,680
what do you think of the sat subject

1390
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,760
test which you only spoke of at the very

1391
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,880
end

1392
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,400
do you think that they carry any weight

1393
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,480
do you think that it's worth um students

1394
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,800
putting time and effort in to to take

1395
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,920
those tests

1396
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,800
um yeah i mean so certainly schools you

1397
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,520
know require them require one or two

1398
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
subject tests so you know um

1399
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,160
yeah and and

1400
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
they are multiple choice and format like

1401
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,400
they're maybe a little less susceptible

1402
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
to

1403
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,079
outright just you know bypassing content

1404
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,000
than than the sat which is a broader

1405
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,280
test but

1406
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
any any multiple choice test has some

1407
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,640
degree of this vulnerability

1408
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,720
i'm right now working with

1409
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,400
a teacher a math teacher that needs to

1410
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
take the praxis test this professional

1411
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,280
exam

1412
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,800
demonstrating content knowledge and i'm

1413
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,079
going through some of these tricks with

1414
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,240
him so you know ets

1415
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,119
is the

1416
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,200
the the non-profit that the college

1417
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,280
board kind of farms out the design of

1418
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,760
these tests they make the sat subject

1419
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,680
tests they make the ap test they make

1420
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,200
the practice exam so yeah there's

1421
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
there's a wide network of applicable

1422
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,880
absolutely so one of the things just to

1423
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,559
piggyback on that that i've moved on to

1424
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,000
um after the sat prep is um preparing

1425
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,440
the teachers for their professional

1426
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,640
exams i think that's a really

1427
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,880
interesting space too um quick comment

1428
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,599
um in my day the sat uh multiple choice

1429
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,000
questions were a through f a through e

1430
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,160
not just a through d so that added a

1431
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,920
layer of complexity i would always tell

1432
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,359
students um when it comes to the

1433
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,440
guessing just pick one letter and guess

1434
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,680
that the whole way through right

1435
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,079
yeah same thing and and the act again

1436
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,240
like the sister test to the sat almost

1437
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,680
everything i said applies to that as

1438
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,440
well um

1439
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,119
that's a five choice multiple choice

1440
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,280
test and yep okay i gotta go thank you

1441
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,130
hmm

1442
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:18,749
