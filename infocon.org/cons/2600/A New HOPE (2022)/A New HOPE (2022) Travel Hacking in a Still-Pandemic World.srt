speaker later this afternoon

10

the pandemic says the pandemic has

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,320
changed a lot but there are some things

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
that hasn't changed it hasn't changed

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
our next speaker's level of travel so

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
far he's visited 76 countries and the

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
other thing it hasn't changed

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
is our speaker's love for 2600 he's been

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,399
writing for 2600 for 30 years

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,790
welcome please t profit

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,879
[Applause]

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
hi there i hope you guys can all hear me

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
um so

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
yeah really great to be here this

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
afternoon back in new york uh feels

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
weird not to be wearing a mask uh but i

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,040
guess that's uh that's the speaker's

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
privilege for a moment

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
um

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,920
i've been writing for 2600 a long time

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
for 30 years i write the telecom in

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
former uh columns so if you haven't

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
picked up an issue of 2600 lately it

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
still exists uh it's still printed every

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
quarter on paper you can get it

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
digitally on kindle as well and i'm

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,880
always on page 13 so i would love for

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
you to read the column

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,360
what i do with the column is i sometimes

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
will take my travel and phones and put

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400
them together and and so those columns

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
are always a joy to write

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
one other thing that many people don't

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
know about me is that i am a travel

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,600
hacker and so my first travel hack was

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
to japan

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
in college and

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
so what i mean by that is that it's

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
never too early to start if you're in

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
college if you're studying here at st

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
john's you can totally find some awesome

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
stuff to travel hack potentially

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
i write a travel blog called c31b that's

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
scat 31b.com

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,439
and i've visited 76 countries so far i'm

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
on a path to 100 because that gets me

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,120
membership in the traveler century club

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
if i get there i try to actually visit

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
countries and not just breeze through

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
them so that's why the account is so low

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,239
compared to the amount of time that i've

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
been traveling that being said i have

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
made it to all seven continents and why

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
do i do this you know why travel at all

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
it we understand the world a lot better

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
when we see it in person and we may not

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,720
agree with every uh politician in every

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
country we may not find every culture

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,720
comfortable

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
but travel makes all of us better and it

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
makes us

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,120
understand the world with a

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
better perspective and a different

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
perspective

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
so when we're through uh we're gonna

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
have gone through quite a bit in this

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
talk i'm gonna move really fast and

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
cover a lot of material and so part of

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
the reason why i scheduled a workshop

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
after this talk is you'll have an

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
opportunity to ask questions in depth

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
and in fact if you have miles and points

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
and you want to book your own trips then

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
we're just going to do that live we're

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
going to hack

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,040
trips for three hours i think is what's

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,000
in the workshop uh schedule right now or

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
until they kick us out whichever comes

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,800
first

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
so uh

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,440
when we're through you'll have learned

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
whether it's still worth travel hacking

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
spoiler yes it totally is what to expect

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,120
when you're traveling right now how to

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
stay safe well you can't but you can

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
stay safer

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
how to avoid planning pitfalls and

96
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
there's a ton of them and they change

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
all the time and it gets really crazy

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
out there so we'll go through some of

99
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
what can

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,799
really go well and go wrong

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,519
how to avoid testing pitfalls there's

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
you know this really shady kova testing

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
industry and things are changing all the

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
time with that as well

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,480
how green passes and quarantines work

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
the award flights landscape

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
and that has changed quite a bit because

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
if you've tried to fly anywhere lately a

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
lot of flights are cancelled there's

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
fewer of them crews keep getting sick

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
with covet it creates huge problems uh

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,319
and

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
how to avoid a refund headache you know

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
if if things do go sideways

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
and they can and so finally some success

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
factors for your trip so let's dive

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
right in

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,040
first of all is travel hacking still

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
worth it now up on the screen is qatar q

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
suites and what you can see with that

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
seat

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
that screen is bigger than my tv at home

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
i think it's a 36 inch television

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,960
the seat turns into a bed

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,759
so it there's like a motor in it and it

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,680
stretches out and you can they make it

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
up for you they have turn down service

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
they put like a you know mattress pad on

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
it it's super comfy and they bring you a

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
five-course meal

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,840
and in addition to that uh

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
operates some of the longest flights in

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
the world so if you're flying from doha

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,639
to la it's

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,960
16 hours or something crazy so when

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
you're taking a really really really

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
really long flight it's just so worth it

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,880
to be able to be up front so is travel

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
hacking worth it as long as it costs

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
seven thousand dollars for that because

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
that's actually what it would cost if

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
you paid for that service in cash uh yes

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
it's totally worth jumping through some

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
hoops and doing some travel hacking

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
there are still some really really good

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
hacks so the

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
better the hack though the higher the

148
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
risk and that's a thing to keep in mind

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
my best deals have been lately on

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,680
speculative bookings and i book when

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
everything seems absolutely hopeless and

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
terrible and nobody wants to go anywhere

153
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,320
because there's

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
you know the hospitals are full and

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
every country is closed and so

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
uh australia and new zealand and israel

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,039
all turned out to be really good bats if

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,440
you booked last year because all those

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
countries were closed there was no

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
getting into any of them and now they've

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
all opened up

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
but japan hasn't been a good bat

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
it's open just a little right now you

164
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,240
can go in

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,039
if you book a trip uh through a

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,520
tour ranger and they just kind of heard

167
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,039
you around like

168
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,840
the

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,800
dprk travel service in pyongyang you're

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,479
only allowed to go certain places in

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,440
your shop around everywhere but uh it

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
may open up more uh so it could still be

173
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,919
a good bad

174
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,319
prices are still generally higher than

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
they've been in the past and this is for

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
a couple of reasons the first is

177
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
programs have devalued and this is a

178
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
constant and frequent flyer programs

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
your points will always be worth less

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
year over year and the rate of inflation

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
in frequent flyer programs is way worse

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,840
than the rate of inflation that we're

183
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
seeing with money

184
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,960
but it's gotten easier to earn miles and

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
points and so that's a another constant

186
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
right so

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,039
uh they raise all of the the redemption

188
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,240
amounts to be able to book a trip and so

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
nobody signs up for credit cards then

190
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
because the the trips are unachievable

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
so they raised the bonus to sign up for

192
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,759
a credit card you know the cycle repeats

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,880
uh so

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,479
it's gotten easier to score miles and

195
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
points it almost evens the score at this

196
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
point and uh just to remind everyone i

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
am doing a travel hacking workshop

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
after this talk so if you have miles and

199
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,080
you've got points and you've got trips

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
that you want to book and everything

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
seems really hopeless and terrible so it

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
might be a good time to book that's the

203
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,599
conversation to have with me and we're

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,479
just going to book trips live uh and and

205
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,759
we'll hopefully send people some

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
interesting places at the end of hope

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,039
but we do need to match expectations

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
with reality and the reality is pretty

209
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
harsh right now i'm not going to

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
sugarcoat it the first problem if you

211
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
flew here who flew here anybody fly here

212
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,199
yeah did anybody have problems with

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
their flight was it delayed or like you

214
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,360
missed a connection yeah there's a

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
couple of people in the audience who've

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
had that problem uh and so that's what's

217
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
going on right now

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
did anybody's flight get changed before

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
they even left

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
yeah a few people right and probably not

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,919
to something as good as you booked so

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,680
awesome i'm so glad that you all made it

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
here given what's going on but

224
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
cancellations and changes are just

225
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
really really common right now

226
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
don't expect prior notice flexibility is

227
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
essential and

228
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
service once you're on board that's been

229
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
scaled back substantially as well

230
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
they're taking away stuff that used to

231
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,720
be there so uh

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,599
it's

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
you know limited or no hot meals in

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,559
economy class if you fly lufthansa it's

235
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
just absolutely dreadful what they serve

236
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,279
you now uh there's limited or no alcohol

237
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
selection so there's not even anything

238
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
to soften the blow of the bad food that

239
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,039
they're serving and there's limited

240
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
lounge service as well so

241
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
i got hit by that myself my home airport

242
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,519
is vancouver and if you're flying to the

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
u.s the plaza premium lounge is closed

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
right now so nothing available at all uh

245
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
tough unpredictable regulations or

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
another thing that we're fighting your

247
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
trip is going to be governed by

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
regulations and these can change really

249
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
suddenly and unpredictably

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,519
so

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
if you know hawaii for instance they

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
shut down pretty early they didn't want

253
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
tourists bringing kova to the islands

254
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,279
they had limited resources that totally

255
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
made sense they had multiple fall starts

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
with their reopening they were going to

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
reopen and then they weren't and then

258
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
they were going to reopen and then they

259
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
weren't and there were different uh

260
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,839
forms that you had to fill out and then

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
you had to fill out other ones and so

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
this is just a really common pattern

263
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,279
with every country that reopens they

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
kind of have to figure out how they want

265
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
it to work

266
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
european countries have gone in and out

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
of lockdowns and these have happened

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
really suddenly and they've also

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,600
happened

270
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
really inconsistently so

271
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
for instance within the schengen area if

272
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
you were flying into france it was no

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
problem at one point but then if you

274
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
wanted to fly into germany they had a

275
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,279
quarantine required but you could drive

276
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,880
from france to germany and there wasn't

277
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
any of that it it got really uh you know

278
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
confusing for a lot of people testing

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
and vaccination requirements have

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
shifted so

281
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
um it turns out that cobot's really

282
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
contagious and

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
tests 72 hours beforehand aren't enough

284
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
to really effectively stop it so some

285
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
countries have just given up on that

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
idea uh vaccinations as it turns out are

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
just not very good at preventing

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
catching covet or spreading it anymore

289
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
it just they they help with outcomes if

290
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
you get it it's it's way less likely

291
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,279
that you'll end up in the hospital if

292
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
you if you are vaccinated so

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
countries have adjusted based on what

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
the politics are locally and and what

295
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
they think makes sense and

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,000
uh documentation requirements around all

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
of this stuff are also not always clear

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
and are constantly changing for example

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,079
our friendly neighbors to the north in

300
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
canada have an app called arrive can and

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,839
you have to fill it out every single

302
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
time you cross the border with a very

303
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,760
large volume of information even if

304
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,399
you're just driving from an exclave to

305
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
the other side of washington state for

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
instance um so

307
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
the doc the the arrive can requirements

308
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
have changed multiple times and there

309
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
have been multiple iterations i'm not

310
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
beating up on canada right there are

311
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
many countries that have faced similar

312
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
challenges and and how they apply things

313
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,120
but for a while

314
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
uh the canadian government was paying

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
massive amounts of money to test people

316
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,519
traveling routinely across the border

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,200
for deliveries and that kind of thing

318
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
where they didn't even really interact

319
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
with anyone

320
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
and that has

321
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
gradually gotten better over time

322
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,320
although the app is still involved other

323
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
countries have had similar challenges

324
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
too but all of this stuff

325
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
all of it can torpedo your trip and if

326
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
it does insurance won't cover you

327
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
because insurance excludes any sort of

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,319
government actions usually

329
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
so what do you do

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
how do you deal with this stuff well

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
first of all consider whether or not

332
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
you're okay with the risks here because

333
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,440
nobody's even trying to pretend that

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
travel is safe right now it is

335
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
objectively unsafe i went on a trip to

336
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
israel

337
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
and the palestinian territories and

338
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
jordan and came back with coven and i'm

339
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
really careful so if i got it anybody

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
can uh consider though how to reduce

341
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
your attack surface and information

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
security we think about well what's the

343
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,120
attack surface of an application and

344
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
what are all the possible ways that a

345
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,720
hacker could get in think the same way

346
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,079
about your body

347
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,600
and what are the ways that a virus could

348
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
get into it so

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
how are you getting to the airport are

350
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
you doing that on public transportation

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
will you use any facilities while you're

352
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
there are you going to go to a lounge

353
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,959
and take your mask off is it a non-stop

354
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
or a connecting flight well connecting

355
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
flights you're going to get stuck in a

356
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
jet way that's completely airless with

357
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
150 people potentially

358
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
like i did at charles de gaulle a few

359
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,480
weeks ago and that just is a thing so

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
every additional airport and jetway

361
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
queue adds more risk and then where are

362
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
you staying is it a completely

363
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
hermetically sealed building where

364
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
hallways and elevators are shared and

365
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
all of the air is flowing between

366
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,760
different parts of the building

367
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
these are all things that you can

368
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
control you can't really control what

369
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
you get exposed to everywhere but you

370
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,720
can get you can control whether you eat

371
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
indoors or not

372
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
you can control whether you wear an n95

373
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,079
mask and i know it feels like a swamp on

374
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
your face but the things work uh what

375
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
got me in jordan was 10 minutes in in a

376
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
dive boat changing room at the tail end

377
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
of my trip where i knew i would be

378
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
taking that risk and that's where i got

379
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
covered right so the other thing you can

380
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
do is well if there's some risks that

381
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,200
you want to take because those really

382
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
mean a lot to you maybe you put those at

383
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
the end of your trip so you're less

384
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
likely to get sick at the beginning of

385
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
it and ruin your whole trip right

386
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
so travel bans uh

387
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,560
obviously a lot of people have been

388
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
trying to make political stands on

389
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
airplanes and flight crews are just so

390
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
over it they're not having it anymore

391
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,519
the airlines aren't having it anymore

392
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,639
airlines pretty much have the back of

393
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,360
their flight crews at this point and

394
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
uh what they're gonna do if uh if you

395
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,360
just

396
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
you know get violent or stupid is

397
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
usually just kick you off the plane if

398
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,920
if you didn't hit anyone and you lose

399
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
your flight and they may not ban you but

400
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,399
if they want to they can just completely

401
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,000
ban you from their airline and if you

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,519
had frequent flyer miles with that

403
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,120
airline they can close your frequent

404
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
flyer account and take all of your miles

405
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
and some u.s airlines have done this

406
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
so it's gotten to the point where like

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
they would overlook grantiness early on

408
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
but now it's a hair trigger and you just

409
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
get kicked off so if you don't agree

410
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,279
with what a flight crew member is saying

411
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,079
like

412
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
litigating it while you're on board is

413
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
never the right time to do it write a

414
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
letter after your trip

415
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,079
but if you want to go then just they've

416
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
got all the power and you don't have any

417
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
they hold all the cards

418
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,279
travel restrictions testing and

419
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,800
quarantine so if you're going to fly to

420
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
another country then they're going to

421
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
have some paperwork and restrictions

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
that you have to deal with and those can

423
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,720
frequently change but right now most

424
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
countries are open to us passport

425
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
holders for non-essential travel so if

426
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
you want to take a trip to europe for

427
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,279
tourism or to canada for tourism you're

428
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
totally welcome to do that

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
some countries are still only open for

430
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
essential travel though or they're

431
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
entirely closed like the democratic

432
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
people's republic of korea for example

433
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,040
completely closed nobody can go in there

434
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
but the definition of essential and

435
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,040
transit

436
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
depends on the country and often the

437
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,480
whims of the immigration official that

438
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
you're dealing with and this can be a

439
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
real problem

440
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,040
and then if you're traveling to a

441
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
country that's restricted quarantines

442
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,639
are often involved and i'll get into

443
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
quarantines on on a couple of slides

444
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,959
that i have next

445
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,320
so some airports for example tokyo or

446
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,199
taipei remain open for transit so if

447
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
you're flying to say

448
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
malaysia which is open right now

449
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
from say los angeles and you want to do

450
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
that on japan airlines through tokyo you

451
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
can do that

452
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,959
but they only allow it with sterile

453
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
transit on one ticket number what does

454
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
sterile transit mean it means that you

455
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
have one ticket you're not changing

456
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,839
airlines it's all ticketed straight

457
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,440
through and your bags get checked

458
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
through all the way and so and you're

459
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
not leaving the sterile area of the

460
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
airport meaning that you're not passing

461
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
immigration

462
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
any situation that would involve passing

463
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
immigration all of a sudden you're just

464
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
going to be treated like anybody else

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
who showed up in japan and is trying to

466
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,160
get in and the answer is probably no

467
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
with few exceptions

468
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,360
so

469
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
what does this mean when you plan your

470
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,440
trip you really need to avoid transiting

471
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,959
third countries

472
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,880
where possible to minimize itinerary

473
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,199
risk because if you've booked a ticket

474
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,800
through a country that won't let you

475
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
transit you have a problem

476
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
and again travel insurance doesn't apply

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
and no one will help you you just lost

478
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,600
your money or your points potentially or

479
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
maybe not if you booked in a way that's

480
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
refundable

481
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,839
but you did screw up your plans and

482
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,839
that's something that nobody wants right

483
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,560
so

484
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
testing the test industry is the

485
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,359
shadiest thing ever i really hate it

486
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,520
and much of the testing requirements

487
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,799
were driven by the testing industry

488
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,280
delivering kind of questionable results

489
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
and we've seen a lot of countries just

490
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,199
examine whether

491
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,240
the

492
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
benefits outweigh the inconvenience and

493
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,520
the impact on travel and more and more

494
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
countries are just doing away with

495
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
testing at this point because it doesn't

496
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
seem to have stopped the spread of covet

497
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
at all internationally uh testing's a

498
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
less common requirement now

499
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,280
accordingly right but it still exists in

500
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,360
some places and regulations change

501
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
really fast and they've gone both ways

502
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,919
so you need to pay attention to what the

503
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,440
regulations are not when you book your

504
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
trip but when you fly it and that

505
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
actually benefited me on my trip to

506
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,799
israel that i took because

507
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
they were going to require some testing

508
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,120
like a 72-hour pcr test and those have

509
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
gotten harder and more expensive to get

510
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
because they're not as valuable so

511
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,039
they're mostly only used for travel and

512
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,880
then right before i went they just

513
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,200
dropped all testing because it was they

514
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,960
decided that it was pointless so

515
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
regulations can change quickly they've

516
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,559
gone both ways

517
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,799
and some governments require the use of

518
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
a recognized lab

519
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,520
now i'm not going to accuse any

520
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
countries of of any sort of malfeasance

521
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
when it comes to

522
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,559
directing business to particular coveted

523
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,799
testing labs and i certainly would never

524
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
suggest that

525
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
any sort of political influence that's

526
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
undue would be involved because of

527
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
course

528
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,679
most governments are honest but

529
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
the results

530
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
can be really questionable and the

531
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
testing methodology is really

532
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
questionable and i can give an example

533
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
um

534
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
you can you could get

535
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
at the peak of this

536
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,039
a

537
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
pcr test result in mexico

538
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,000
in 15 minutes

539
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
and it takes an hour at minimum to run

540
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,520
the test

541
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
so

542
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
you tell me whether or not

543
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
the results are genuine

544
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
and whether or not that might have been

545
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
shady uh but

546
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
anyhow

547
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,039
on top of this airlines sometimes make

548
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,960
up their own rules and that can get

549
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,840
really uh funny too so you'll go do all

550
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
of your research you'll check what the

551
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,679
government of a country is saying and

552
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
the airline will say yeah well we don't

553
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,320
care we want you to have a pcr test

554
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
so you have to check with both your

555
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
airline and what their understanding of

556
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
the regulations is as well as what the

557
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
government of the country that you're

558
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,640
traveling to says and airlines usually

559
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
look at a tool called thematic as

560
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
authoritative and that can sometimes be

561
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
behind

562
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
so if you don't meet the requirements

563
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
and you show up they're just going to

564
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
deny you boarding

565
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,480
and because you created the problem they

566
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
didn't they're going to treat you as if

567
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
you missed your flight or you know

568
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,720
forgot your passport or whatever uh so

569
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,559
sometimes airlines are flexible when it

570
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
comes to this sort of thing but usually

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
they're not uh if you don't dot every

572
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
eye and check every t

573
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,159
and check every box as you

574
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
plan your trip then it could be a really

575
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
big problem

576
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
and

577
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
so one tip if you are going to a country

578
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
that still requires testing

579
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,200
most health insurance will not cover

580
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
testing for travel purposes

581
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
but if you feel like you might have

582
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,559
covin

583
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,559
they will cover

584
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,760
your

585
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
covet test if you took it for medical

586
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
reasons so

587
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
when you have a pcr test done if you

588
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
just want to make sure you don't have

589
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
covid for public health reasons or you

590
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
feel like you've had a sniffle and you

591
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
want to make sure it's not

592
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
be sure that when they code the test

593
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
they do it in a way that says that it's

594
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,880
for for medical purposes and not for

595
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
travel

596
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,440
and then you can claim it on your

597
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
insurance

598
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
of course you know if you're testing for

599
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
travel you shouldn't commit insurance

600
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
fraud but if

601
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,120
if you think you might have a sniffle

602
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
it's it's always good to check right so

603
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
arrival testing uh some governments do

604
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
require testing on arrival and so this

605
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
is this is still a thing you can show up

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
in a country

607
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,559
meet all the requirements and then they

608
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,000
test you when you get there and this can

609
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
be everything from a random sample of

610
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
people so people coming to canada

611
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,039
right up until a few weeks ago they were

612
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,799
pulling people out of line at the

613
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,280
airport as they were in the immigration

614
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,960
line to check in and you would get a

615
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
random covet test

616
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
and so

617
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
that can sometimes allow you to test out

618
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
a quarantine if there's a government

619
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,120
that

620
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
is still imposing a quarantine when you

621
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,360
arrive but also it can create a problem

622
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
for you if you were positive

623
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,400
so

624
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
the other side of testing is well what

625
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
if you just want to make sure that

626
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
you're not sick before you go and you do

627
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
your own tests those rapid tests that

628
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
the government sent you that the the us

629
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
government sent you for free

630
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
just aren't all that accurate uh with

631
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
new infections if you've been sick for a

632
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
few days your tests will show up

633
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,880
positive but

634
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
if you're early in the infection very

635
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
often they won't show up or the line

636
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,919
will be really really really faint so

637
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
you've got to look carefully

638
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,120
they're just not all that sensitive so

639
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
you can be infected and spreading the

640
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,799
infection before you test positive

641
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,480
that's a really good reason to wear a

642
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
mask on a plane if you're not required

643
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
to just be kind to your fellow human

644
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,919
beings

645
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,679
even though you're not required to do

646
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,720
that

647
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
and if you feel sick on your travel day

648
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
even if you don't test positive for

649
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
covid just assume it is and

650
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
um that you could be infecting others

651
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
but

652
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,840
even if you're completely only

653
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
self-interested and you don't really

654
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,360
care about infecting other people and

655
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
i'm sure nobody here feels that way but

656
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,039
you know there are really selfish people

657
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,039
out there in the world

658
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,520
it's just not safe because

659
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
if you've got the wrong strain of covid

660
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
and it turns into pneumonia and you're

661
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
on a 16 hour flight that could be really

662
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,360
bad for you because if you're flying

663
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,960
from say qatar like doha to seattle that

664
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,039
flight goes basically directly over the

665
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
north pole there is just

666
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
freaking nothing for hours and hours and

667
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,320
hours of that flight so if and if you're

668
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
and if you're experiencing a really bad

669
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,919
pneumonia episode that's just not a

670
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
place to be i've got a a um

671
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,760
an article i wrote on seat 31b about

672
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
somebody who died on a flight that i was

673
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
on and

674
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
it was similarly we were just way over

675
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
the far north of canada

676
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
in the canadian arctic there was

677
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
literally nothing they could do there

678
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
was nowhere to land no way to get

679
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,159
medical attention and so you just don't

680
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
want to ever put yourself in a situation

681
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
where you're going to be somewhere like

682
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,640
that and not able to get help

683
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
green passes so this is an israeli green

684
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,320
pass

685
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
hopefully i covered up the qr code

686
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
enough that nobody can do anything bad

687
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
with it

688
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,600
but

689
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,360
these are required in some countries so

690
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
israel was really innovative with trying

691
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
to figure out how to keep their society

692
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,799
operating as close to normally as

693
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,720
possible while also

694
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,640
dealing with covid and so one thing they

695
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,240
did is they required people to get

696
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
vaccinated really early push that very

697
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,360
hard push boosters before any other

698
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
country did and they started doing these

699
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
screen passes where if you'd been

700
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,679
vaccinated and tested you could

701
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,760
you would then have the ability to go

702
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,320
into certain places and so these are

703
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,200
increasingly not a thing as much anymore

704
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,039
some countries still do them though like

705
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,320
qatar

706
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
if you want to go into

707
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
if you want to go into the city of doha

708
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
you've got to sign up for their version

709
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,880
of a green pass and the same is true in

710
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,640
saudi arabia they've got a

711
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,440
green pass as well and to be able to get

712
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,520
into um

713
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,360
you know basically anything

714
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,120
you need a qr code on your phone that's

715
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
issued by the government that says

716
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
you've been vaccinated and they scan

717
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
that so

718
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,240
you sometimes can't find that out easily

719
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
that you need this thing until you show

720
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,799
up in a country and then you're

721
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,320
scrambling trying to figure out how to

722
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
get it issued you know when you can't

723
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,080
get into anywhere or check into your

724
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,279
hotel

725
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,159
so

726
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,919
do check what the requirements are

727
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,000
before you go someplace and do that

728
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,600
really soon before you go so israel

729
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
in between the time that i got my green

730
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,039
pass and the time that i landed they

731
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,000
phased out even using them for anything

732
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
so i had the thing and never even even

733
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
needed it but it can go the other way

734
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,960
and it's they're very much of things

735
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,840
still in china so if you travel to china

736
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,279
you have to be scanned to go into

737
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,960
anywhere and then also if you want to

738
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
travel between different parts of china

739
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,000
they scan your green pass as well and

740
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
they can block you from travel between

741
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
different parts of the city or inner

742
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,120
city depending on what the covid

743
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
situation is based on where you've been

744
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
so it can get very intricate and

745
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
detailed with this kind of stuff

746
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
so your qr code for vaccination if

747
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,919
you've gotten one of those that's a

748
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,480
different qr code than a green pass qr

749
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
code yes i know that the whole point of

750
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,840
the green pass is to check that you've

751
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
been vaccinated but because there are

752
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
different vaccination documents

753
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,559
government authorities have decided that

754
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,360
they don't all they don't trust other qr

755
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
codes so they go validate your qr code

756
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,360
before they give you a green pass

757
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,760
so

758
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
you know a lot of people say well i can

759
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
just get a fake

760
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
qr code that says that i've been

761
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
vaccinated when i haven't or you can you

762
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,440
know buy a fake vaccination card

763
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
it's getting way harder to do that

764
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,039
because the systems are now

765
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
interconnected and

766
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,600
it's so the false

767
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
false vaccination cards are are being

768
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
able to be found much more easily by

769
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,720
airlines and by governments and

770
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,840
governments just generally aren't

771
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
messing around with this stuff if you're

772
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,360
supposed to have be vaccinated and you

773
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
claim to be and you've made a false

774
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,159
claim they're just going to throw the

775
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
book at you at this point and they don't

776
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,360
care if you're a nun so it's just

777
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
expect to be arrested and charged if

778
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
you're playing these kinds of games with

779
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
international flights in another country

780
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,559
you don't have the same rights as here

781
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,360
so just uh you know kind of decide

782
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,400
whether or not you want to go there

783
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
based on what the requirements are not

784
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,679
all countries require a vaccination to

785
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,200
travel so if you're not comfortable

786
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
being vaccinated there are still places

787
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,640
that you can go in the world and

788
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,400
procedures you can follow costa rica

789
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,960
would be happy to have you

790
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,840
so

791
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,200
um

792
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,120
trips can end badly

793
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
here's me at expo 2020 that trip ended

794
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,039
badly quarantines are real and self-paid

795
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,399
fool around and find out

796
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,960
so if you look at the bottom

797
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
this is the amount of points that i had

798
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
to pay

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,760
to

800
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
cover a room for my friend who came up

801
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,360
positive with coved

802
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,039
because

803
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,880
they require a seven day quarantine if

804
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
you test positive

805
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,200
we

806
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,880
ran around expo had a lot of fun in

807
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,200
dubai went to get our pcr tests so we

808
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
could both go home i was negative he was

809
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,559
positive

810
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,600
so

811
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
we ended up using my points because that

812
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,720
was a better deal for the room but this

813
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,039
is

814
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,520
685 worth of points roughly

815
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,320
and that's just out of your pocket so if

816
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,399
you don't have that financial buffer to

817
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,000
be able to deal with whatever government

818
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
is going to do to you if you test

819
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
positive while you're in their country

820
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
then

821
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
that could be a really big problem

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
especially in a country like the united

823
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
arab emirates where they will throw you

824
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
in prison if you they literally have

825
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,559
debtors prison there so

826
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
if if you do not pay bills like that

827
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,520
ends in prison uh not a good thing so

828
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,559
um

829
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
just be aware when you travel like plan

830
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
that extra buffer like how are you going

831
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,399
to tell your job that you're you know

832
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,279
locked in a 10-day quarantine uh how are

833
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
you going to pay for that does your

834
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,039
health insurance cover it if you get

835
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,279
really sick and need treatment

836
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,200
these are things to think ahead and have

837
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,240
a plan for it before you go

838
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
so quarantines on arrival or if you test

839
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
positive

840
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
different countries just have different

841
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,880
approaches to this

842
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
there's a thing called a hard quarantine

843
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,039
and what that means is that if you're in

844
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,360
hong kong they're going to tell you

845
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,919
where you go it's a it's a location of

846
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,440
the government's choosing if you're

847
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,840
positive from covid for kovid you go to

848
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
a coveted camp they like give you a room

849
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
that is very sparse in an ecco trailer

850
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,440
essentially and you're there for as long

851
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
as they keep you

852
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
with regular tests

853
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
and some gourmet noodles

854
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,559
self quarantine so other locations like

855
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
the emirates if you come up positive for

856
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,960
kova they say all right you have to

857
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,279
quarantine we have they have a whole app

858
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,360
built to monitor your quarantine they

859
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,279
check in on you regularly the police

860
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,039
came to make sure that my friend was

861
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,840
there

862
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,720
uh it's a really serious thing right but

863
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
you at least you're allowed to pick a

864
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,799
hotel and quarantine there for the next

865
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,440
uh seven days seven to ten days right uh

866
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,159
depending on how uh how long

867
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,000
you test negative because you can test

868
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,840
out a quarantine early in dubai

869
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,240
um so there's special quarantine taxis

870
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,360
that may be required uh in israel if you

871
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
need to be taken to a

872
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
hospital or a quarantine facility

873
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,760
there's only like specific ambulances

874
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
that you can take these are not cheap

875
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,720
they're expensive and you're paying for

876
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
all that

877
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,039
additional testing may be required so if

878
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,520
you subsequently test like if if they

879
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,320
put you in a quarantine just in case

880
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
you might be positive

881
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,600
some countries do this you're

882
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
you arrive there and if you arrive in

883
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
taiwan

884
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,760
then you're kind of in a no man's land

885
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
quarantine for a while with regular

886
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,799
testing to make sure that you come up

887
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,440
negative if during that testing you come

888
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
up positive then it's going to be the

889
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,039
however they deal with people that are

890
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
positive protocol and that maybe they

891
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
leave you where they where you are it

892
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,840
may be that they move you to a

893
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,240
quarantine facility so just a thing to

894
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,679
keep in mind

895
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,760
and then some countries will let you

896
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,159
test out of quarantine with the negative

897
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,640
test three to five days after arrival i

898
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,399
know this stuff is really a drag to

899
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,720
think about right but it's also risk

900
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,360
management is part of planning travel

901
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
and this is a whole new set of risks

902
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
that we've never really had to deal with

903
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,399
before so just be sure you have a plan

904
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,760
and the right amount of insurance and

905
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
the right financial buffer and some

906
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
grace from your job

907
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
if you do come up

908
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,960
positive while you're traveling

909
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,840
award booking success factors and

910
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
refunds and and that fun that kind of

911
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
fun stuff so

912
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,480
i specialize in award travel that is how

913
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
i book the majority of my travel i do

914
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
not pay with cash i pay with miles and

915
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,039
points and i basically get really

916
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,840
awesome trips that are paid for by banks

917
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,880
and i don't really pay anything for them

918
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,679
or very little and so

919
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
award travel it turns out is super

920
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
awesome for uncertainty like this

921
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
because a lot of those

922
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
trips are refundable

923
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
and award availability depending on

924
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
where you're going remember at the

925
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
beginning where i said book when

926
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
everything is absolutely terrible when

927
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
it looks like the world is ending right

928
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
because that means that availability is

929
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,679
going to be completely wide open fairly

930
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,039
often

931
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,360
people were booking to australia

932
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,559
uh

933
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,799
last year and it was just totally wide

934
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,399
open on the schedules you could book

935
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,399
first class to australia from new york

936
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,279
on qantas with points that's just never

937
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,120
a thing and it was totally a thing right

938
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,480
now

939
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
i'm seeing first class availability

940
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,799
pretty regularly on japan airlines they

941
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,440
almost never made it available before

942
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,559
so

943
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,240
that being said a word availability is

944
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
just all over the place it's essentially

945
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,840
impossible to some destinations such as

946
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,720
china right now why because

947
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,880
there's very few flights it's a heavily

948
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,760
regulated territory to go into it's it's

949
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,679
just really really tough to get into

950
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,000
china on an award at all airlines can

951
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,919
charge whatever they want in cash so of

952
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,679
course they're doing that

953
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,399
but within asia flights are almost wide

954
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,440
open

955
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
if you want to go from singapore to

956
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,159
vietnam

957
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,320
no problem right now and that's

958
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
not very far but if you want to go from

959
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,240
singapore to seoul it's also wide open

960
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,840
right now and that's a pretty long

961
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,519
flight

962
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,320
it's super tough for north america

963
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,919
why because we opened up earlier than

964
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,559
everybody else and so there's just a lot

965
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,399
of pent up demand for travel and

966
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,360
americans love to travel internationally

967
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,320
so

968
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
things got booked up out of here pretty

969
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,919
quickly but canada opened way later and

970
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
who knows canada exists

971
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,519
anybody uh a few people yeah exactly so

972
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,679
a lot of people in the u.s just forget

973
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
like if you're here in new york montreal

974
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,640
is

975
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
half a day's drive away right so

976
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,760
that's a great place that you can

977
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
that you can get a lot of flights out of

978
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,360
and there's more availability from

979
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,880
canada right now just because they

980
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
opened so late that a lot of people had

981
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
already made other summer summer plans

982
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
so

983
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,159
uh pricing just isn't what you'd expect

984
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,120
though

985
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
fewer flights

986
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,000
overall plus more demand overall equals

987
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
higher prices and there's just no real

988
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
way around that

989
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,559
particularly combined with the

990
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,240
devaluations and award programs that

991
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,519
we've seen so

992
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,679
uh routing pitfalls

993
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
this gets really important so i get

994
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,799
really nerdy with routing and if you've

995
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
seen any of my previous talks uh you

996
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,599
know i like to do fun stuff like

997
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,359
buy a ticket from one city to another

998
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,199
city which isn't where i'm traveling and

999
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,440
then go grab a cheap low-cost carrier

1000
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,280
flight to the place i'm actually going

1001
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,199
and stringing two tickets together or

1002
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,040
maybe even three

1003
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
or doing unusual routings to get to

1004
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
places because uh

1005
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
that's also kind of fun sometimes and

1006
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,960
and it opens up possibilities that

1007
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
aren't already there that are not

1008
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,399
usually there

1009
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,079
going to australia through korea for

1010
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,760
example i mean that's totally a thing

1011
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
you can do

1012
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
it's just not something most people

1013
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,639
would normally book well

1014
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,520
just because an award ticket or a hacked

1015
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
fare is available

1016
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,359
does not mean that you qualify for the

1017
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
routing to actually fly on that

1018
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,440
based what the based on what the

1019
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,079
restrictions are and so um you know we

1020
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,918
talked about sterile transit for example

1021
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
if you book a ticket through

1022
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,160
put two tickets through japan right now

1023
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,599
that creates a condition where you have

1024
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,760
to pass japanese immigration to claim

1025
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
your checked bag

1026
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,400
or pass japanese immigration to check in

1027
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,960
with the other carrier so and they won't

1028
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,720
even let you get on a plane if your

1029
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,960
final destination isn't all on one

1030
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,800
ticket because it'll look like you're

1031
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
flying to tokyo even if you have a

1032
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
second onward ticket from there so uh

1033
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
that can't be

1034
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
that that can't necessarily be a thing

1035
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
even though it would be perfect to fly

1036
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
on uh jowl to tokyo and then continue

1037
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,079
onward from on a a to somewhere else

1038
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,000
normally we can totally do that

1039
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
right now

1040
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
not a great idea so

1041
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,320
always check tomato or the ayata travel

1042
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,240
center and also check with the airline

1043
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,839
to make sure that their understanding of

1044
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,640
what the

1045
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
what the routing rules are matches what

1046
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,640
your understanding is and how do you

1047
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
find that out uh google united to matic

1048
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,359
or use your favorite search engine like

1049
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,599
i don't know whatever it is

1050
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,920
it'll point you to the united tomatic

1051
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
page there's another one that you can

1052
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
look for using your favorite search

1053
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,640
engine for iata travel center spelled

1054
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,920
with an re

1055
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
and that also takes you to the world map

1056
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
however

1057
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,880
remember how i said that the regulation

1058
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,400
the source of truth for most airlines

1059
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,119
systematic entomatic isn't always up to

1060
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,040
date they even admit this on their own

1061
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
map so you can see like the grey

1062
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
countries it says latest updates

1063
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,640
currently under review right

1064
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
um

1065
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
so they don't even know like the top

1066
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,000
experts in the industry don't even know

1067
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
authoritatively up to the minute exactly

1068
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
what the regulations are because things

1069
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,440
change so rapidly so what you have to go

1070
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,680
with is whatever is entematic and assume

1071
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,040
that that's what the airline's going to

1072
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,119
enforce unless they say that they're

1073
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,880
going to enforce something more than

1074
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,839
that

1075
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,000
for example

1076
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
emirates requires a pc was requiring a

1077
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
pcr test to enter the united states even

1078
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,760
though a rapid test was fine for our

1079
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,520
regulations that was just their own

1080
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,359
regulation in dubai

1081
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,440
so you've got to be really sure that

1082
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
you're satisfying the requirements of

1083
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,720
your airline

1084
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
and the government the airline can be

1085
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
wrong and the government is usually

1086
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,839
right but

1087
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,440
if the airline is more restrictive

1088
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,240
you've got to do that

1089
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,040
refunds that's our favorite part so you

1090
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
booked a trip it was really awesome and

1091
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
then the whole

1092
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,599
world

1093
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
changed again

1094
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,760
which has happened a few times for us in

1095
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
the past couple of years

1096
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,359
and now you want to refund well some

1097
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,359
airlines and loyalty programs have been

1098
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,839
super flexible with award bookings and

1099
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
they're just in effect fully refundable

1100
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
so delta and american

1101
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,160
most of the fares that you can book

1102
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
through those two airlines are just

1103
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
fully refundable no problem at all

1104
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
they'll give your points back they won't

1105
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,680
charge you any money to do it but most

1106
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,839
airlines and most loyalty programs are

1107
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,160
struggling to survive frankly and so any

1108
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,839
source of revenue they can possibly get

1109
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,440
they're doing it one of my favorite

1110
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
programs is uh that of a bankrupt

1111
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,400
colombian airline called avianca their

1112
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,640
program is called life miles

1113
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,400
they're bankrupt they're not going to

1114
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,839
give you anything they need money so

1115
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,000
they charge a 25 booking fee they're

1116
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
totally keeping it and if you want to

1117
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,680
make any changes or cancellations it

1118
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,040
could be up to 200 so it's just

1119
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,480
you know you have to really look at the

1120
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,359
rules of the the carrier and the loyalty

1121
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,960
program that you're booking through and

1122
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
don't be surprised when you have to pay

1123
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
now is it worth booking with life miles

1124
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
anyway despite that yeah maybe i mean

1125
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
depending on what the risk is

1126
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
you can get some really great award

1127
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,079
bookings from them if you're flying

1128
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,920
tomorrow somewhere and you're doing a

1129
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,520
last minute first class ticket on

1130
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,119
lufthansa which is a thing you can often

1131
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,960
do with that program

1132
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
that's super awesome it's a really great

1133
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
experience it would cost a crazy amount

1134
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
of money and probably the rules are not

1135
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
going to change between now and tomorrow

1136
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
right but

1137
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
it just depends what you're booking you

1138
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,599
need to be really sure

1139
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,000
so that being said if the airline

1140
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,160
canceled the flight on you

1141
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,599
and some of the people some people

1142
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,960
raised their hands and said yeah that

1143
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
happened to me on the way here

1144
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
any time an airline cancels your flight

1145
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,280
and they do they cancel the flight on

1146
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
you you can actually ask for your money

1147
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,720
back and they have to give it to you for

1148
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
the most part or you can ask for your

1149
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
points back and they have to give it to

1150
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
you for the most part without charging

1151
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,720
you any fees they will try anything

1152
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,920
possible to charge you fees and to give

1153
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,200
you like

1154
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
you know airline vouchers instead of

1155
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
actual money but if you fight hard

1156
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
enough you can usually get any fees

1157
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,440
waived if they cancelled on you and you

1158
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,400
can get actual cash money back which is

1159
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,520
better than an airline voucher

1160
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
so

1161
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,079
governments have started stepping in and

1162
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,680
and this is the thing that you know that

1163
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
happened uh largely because of a couple

1164
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
of extremely bad actors so air canada is

1165
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,560
an example of a bad actor

1166
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,839
they just refused to give anybody

1167
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,200
refunds at all at the beginning of the

1168
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,400
pandemic

1169
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,680
if you had a ticket and they canceled

1170
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,280
the flight on you they're like sorry

1171
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
we're keeping your money here's a

1172
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,160
voucher

1173
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,640
and uh after the second bailout that

1174
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,400
they got from the canadian government

1175
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,920
the canadian government attached a

1176
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
condition that they had to finally give

1177
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,359
refunds which they're they they

1178
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
eventually dead

1179
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,240
united

1180
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
said yeah we'll give you a refund in 18

1181
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
months

1182
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
and

1183
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
that didn't pass muster either with the

1184
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
department of transportation there were

1185
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,680
conditions that were attached to the

1186
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,119
airline bailout that they had to give

1187
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,599
actual refunds as well

1188
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
so usually you can get a refund but

1189
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
why not book with points

1190
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
because

1191
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,560
then you're just fighting over points

1192
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,839
instead of a substantial amount of money

1193
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,200
you can't book everything with points

1194
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
but if you can book with points it's a

1195
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,400
way better plan right now for anything

1196
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,640
that might blow up in your face

1197
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,359
so some success factors

1198
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,520
the success factors that are key are

1199
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
just keep it simple

1200
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,520
the simpler your itinerary the easier it

1201
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,079
will be to fix if it blows up

1202
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,119
reconfirm reconfirm reconfirm and uh

1203
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,280
this is really important so you didn't

1204
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,960
used to have to reconfirm reservations

1205
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,800
of minor changes happened airlines have

1206
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
started playing a game now where if they

1207
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,800
tweak your itinerary

1208
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,440
if you don't go in and reconfirm it

1209
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,520
they assume it's not ticketed anymore

1210
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
and cancelled and i am a very

1211
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
experienced international traveler and i

1212
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
ran into this with their france

1213
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,240
a few weeks ago in vancouver they'd

1214
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,920
changed my flight day

1215
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,079
like said yeah we you know we ticketed

1216
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,160
you on this new flight and i had to go

1217
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
and press a button and if i hadn't done

1218
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,240
that like i did not in fact have a

1219
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
ticket fortunately they were able to fix

1220
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
it for me at the airport and everything

1221
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,800
went smoothly

1222
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,319
but i had the same problem with uh

1223
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,240
flying royal jordanian on a british

1224
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,160
airways award ticket

1225
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,240
they also moved my flight and i didn't

1226
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,000
click the thingy and because i hadn't

1227
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,440
clicked the thingy i didn't have a

1228
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,480
tickety

1229
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,040
so anyway uh that

1230
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,680
um got sorted out as well on the fly but

1231
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
only because they'd subbed in a 787 like

1232
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,720
a giant plane uh and had an extra seat

1233
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,079
otherwise i might have just been left

1234
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,800
there in tel aviv so changes that are

1235
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
happening and make sure you need to

1236
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,960
that you press a button when you do it

1237
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,680
uh know what you can optimize in a lot

1238
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,800
of cases

1239
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
you know you're optimizing for is there

1240
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,119
a flight available at all as opposed to

1241
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,040
is this the best flight and the best way

1242
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,440
to do it uh stay informed about your

1243
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,280
travel destination keep on

1244
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,920
on top of all that thematic data

1245
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
and make sure that right up until the

1246
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
day that you go that you've satisfied

1247
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,480
all the requirements you know about any

1248
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
green passes that you need there are

1249
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
like any health ministry forms you need

1250
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,599
to fill out

1251
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,680
these things are

1252
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,520
basically the same kind of paperwork as

1253
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,960
getting a visa to a country that you're

1254
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,800
going to and it's just

1255
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,319
you kind of have to scramble to figure

1256
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,520
out what all the requirements are

1257
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,200
because there's not any one good source

1258
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
of information

1259
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,640
call your airline they will know what

1260
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
they're going to check for at least and

1261
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,359
that's a good starting point because at

1262
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,760
least it gets you on the flight

1263
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
and then finally avoid any sort of

1264
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,160
non-refundable arrangements it's just

1265
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,839
too uncertain right now

1266
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,000
hotels if you're if you've got a prepaid

1267
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,680
rate that's non-refundable

1268
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,839
well that money's gone if you can't go

1269
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,920
they're not making any exceptions for

1270
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,440
covet

1271
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,599
airbnb took away pretty much every

1272
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,920
exception uh even if you get covet i

1273
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,160
think airbnb is is now not refunding you

1274
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,240
so uh you got to be kind of careful with

1275
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,920
this stuff and and honestly um it's

1276
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
it helps create the right incentives for

1277
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,480
you to stay home if you get sick and if

1278
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,880
you get sick please stay home

1279
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,280
somebody went on a dive boat sick and

1280
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,599
gave me covet and that sucked so please

1281
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,359
don't be that person

1282
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,079
uh so with that uh if i have time for q

1283
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,319
a i'm happy to take q a if i don't have

1284
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,240
time for q a then come to my workshop

1285
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,680
and i'll answer any questions there

1286
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,119
you want to just come up here i think

1287
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,960
this one's live

1288
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,839
okay

1289
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,920
um i'd like to start off with a question

1290
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,839
from the matrix chat

1291
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,200
um oh thank you yes awesome uh and hi to

1292
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,720
everybody who couldn't physically make

1293
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,599
it here

1294
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,720
i'm really glad you're watching infinity

1295
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,800
switch cases asks is it worthwhile

1296
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
sticking picking an airline and sticking

1297
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,319
to them especially if you travel for

1298
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,119
work

1299
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,960
or should my strategy

1300
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,800
be focused on

1301
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
credit card points or other such

1302
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,680
programs

1303
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,640
okay so the answer is it depends but it

1304
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,480
depends way less than it used to and

1305
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,119
here's why i'm in a travel group with

1306
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,160
you know a lot of people who are

1307
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,319
frequent travelers and

1308
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,560
chase elite status to be able to get

1309
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,160
extra perks from the airlines and when

1310
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,560
you fly one airline a lot

1311
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
then they treat you better and they give

1312
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,880
you some additional perks like upgrades

1313
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,000
or maybe free bags well

1314
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
upgrades are what people chase the most

1315
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,839
right now and because there are so many

1316
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,520
fewer flights than there were in the

1317
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,720
past

1318
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,640
those upgrades aren't coming even if

1319
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,440
you're the highest level of

1320
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,079
uh status with airlines very often you

1321
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,760
don't don't get upgraded because you

1322
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,240
know what if somebody will pay cash for

1323
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,920
that first class seat

1324
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,160
then they're going to get the seed and

1325
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,839
the difference between

1326
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,160
a cash fare in the back and a cash fare

1327
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
in first class isn't all that much

1328
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,200
anymore in some cases so why be loyal to

1329
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,760
an airline i pick the schedule that's

1330
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,560
the best and wherever i can go non-stop

1331
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,280
and

1332
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,119
that's kind of the first you know my

1333
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,119
first cut

1334
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,960
but my first preference above that is

1335
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,800
where can i go for free using miles and

1336
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,839
points and and who can i fly for free so

1337
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,200
i would say

1338
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,280
go all in with the banks

1339
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
and you know with certain hotel programs

1340
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,839
that are transferable

1341
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,920
any other questions

1342
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,960
none

1343
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,640
awesome well

1344
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,839
oh one yeah sure

1345
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,720
um

1346
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
okay cool thanks for asking that so the

1347
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,760
question is hey what are these miles and

1348
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,119
points things you keep talking about

1349
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,160
like i thought we were going to talk

1350
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,440
about travel hacking here like uh and so

1351
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
what that actually is is a whole other

1352
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,920
talk that i gave called travel hacking

1353
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,760
with the telecom informer i believe it

1354
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,000
was six years ago right here at hope you

1355
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,760
can look up that talk

1356
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,079
but going really really really fast

1357
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,160
banks have points uh american express

1358
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,560
has membership reward chase has ultimate

1359
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,440
rewards uh capital one got into the game

1360
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,280
and they have their own points city has

1361
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,040
points and so you can earn points with

1362
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
different credit card programs and

1363
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,200
transfer them to airlines those airline

1364
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,880
frequent flyer programs can get you

1365
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,960
tickets in fancy

1366
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,359
first and business class or in the back

1367
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,440
depending on which kind of points that

1368
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,359
you earn and so that's kind of my

1369
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,440
favorite way to travel is

1370
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,200
go get a bunch of points from the banks

1371
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
that they give away for free transfer

1372
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,720
them to airlines and then get tickets

1373
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,200
for free and then more fly less money i

1374
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,520
like that

1375
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,400
any other questions

1376
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,800
okay the question was can you travel

1377
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,559
hack trains

1378
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,720
does amtrak have a loyalty program yes

1379
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,559
they do i know very little about it

1380
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,800
because their service on the west coast

1381
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,520
is practically non-existent

1382
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,000
so there are people that play that game

1383
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,119
i think there's a whole uh blog of uh

1384
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,599
for for amtrak points hackers and let's

1385
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,559
not stop with amtrak there is a travel

1386
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,720
hack you can do with greyhound points

1387
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,160
too they're they're running a promo

1388
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,440
where if you take a bunch of really

1389
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
cheap bus trips then you can cash in

1390
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,119
those points for a ticket anywhere in

1391
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,480
their system

1392
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,599
there's a guy called miles in transit

1393
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,280
he's got a twitter account which i

1394
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,599
believe is miles in transit who just did

1395
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,440
a cross-country trip

1396
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,559
on a greyhound bus which looked like the

1397
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,280
worst experience i've ever seen

1398
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,559
but he's young and i guess

1399
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,280
strong enough to handle it

1400
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
all right well thanks all for coming it

1401
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,680
