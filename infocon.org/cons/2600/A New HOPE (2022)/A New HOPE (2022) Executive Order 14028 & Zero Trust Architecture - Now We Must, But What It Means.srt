executive order 14028

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,679

[Applause]

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,759
thank you thank you so much it's so nice

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
to be hope i was just trying to remember

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
how many times i've been speaking here

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,479
but this is the least technical talk i

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
will have ever given because this is now

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
driven about the

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
craziness

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
around uh zero trust which is the worst

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
buzzword in a recent history most unused

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
most misunderstood everybody is trying

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
to use it misuse it and sell you snake

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
oil and of course we love snake oil

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
that's always so tasty but this is a a

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
talk where we are going to touch a the

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
execute order uh given what zero trust

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,319
means a little bit of philosophy again

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
behind human mind and also talk wouldn't

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
be a talk if you are only talking about

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
the problem and not offering any kind of

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
idea how to solve a problem so i'm also

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,959
going to talk about a

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
open source project which is solving a

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
lot of these problems we are going not

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,280
all of the problems but some of the

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
problems and also why open source is now

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,040
the

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,239
preferred solution by governments and

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
even when we are talking here about the

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,959
united states executed order there's an

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,959
international aspect to this and a

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,239
number of other governments are in

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,800
different phases of implementing similar

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,680
regulation in the place so this is a

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,879
global uh trend now uh to have a

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,959
government mandated uh transition to

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,959
zero trust architecture is not u.s

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
centric

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
so first of all my slides are always

82
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
full of a lot of stuff i'm not going to

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
read them line by line so i know when

84
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
you put a new slide people are tending

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
to be a little bit losing me so whatever

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
you want to do but the whole idea is to

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,680
talk to understand that zero trust is a

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
very old term

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
uh it there's two different

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,560
so to speak fathers for that

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
usually it's a recognize that john

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,239
kinder von

93
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
is the father because he brought the

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
term into a global knowledge and and

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
broader knowledge but actually if you

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,879
look behind there was a lot of work done

97
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,720
by different parties and the jericho

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
forum was a

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
first people around and the two this is

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,279
2004 is a not an exact date the

101
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
conversation in jericho forum took over

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
a year so it it spilled over the other

103
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,520
to 2003 uh in the beginning but they

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
were starting to define

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
the the parametrization so edgelit hls

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
network which is of course one of the

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
key concept of zero trust

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,479
so that happened already 2004

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
and beyond corp which is in a lot of

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
ways the first definition of modern idea

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
of uh of

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
zero trust architecture how it would

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
work in corporate infrastructure that

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
was also 2009.

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,759
today we are in a situation where we do

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
have a formal uh definition of what

117
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,520
zerotax architecture looks like a

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
standard for national institute of

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
standards and technology the 80207

120
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
so there is a formal definition uh as

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
you see 2018 was the year when that was

122
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
started to be drafted the final version

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
i believe came summer 2020 so it came

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
after the pandemic started but still

125
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,320
it didn't incorporate the changes and if

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
we look what xero trust comes from it

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
comes from a need

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
to adapt yourself into an enterprise

129
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
world and now of course pandemic is

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,400
changing everything

131
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,120
so

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
these are the original

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
roots of this idea

134
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
but if you look where the idea comes

135
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
from this is a much narrower view than

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,039
how we understand zero trust today

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
because zero trust really is a set it's

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
a family of massive paradigm changes

139
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
across the

140
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
methodology and across the the way we

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
think cyber security

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
and because it's it's a a combination of

143
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,520
multiple paradigm changes

144
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,240
it

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
causes confusion

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
we in a i asked in the previous slide

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,199
should

148
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,360
why don't we understand this why we have

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
still confusion

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
that is because this is not a simple

151
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
thing this is a this is not something

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
which is going to be defined as it is

153
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
today it's going to be evolving

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
when i went to rsa

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
about one-third of the companies on

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
the floor were selling

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
something zero trust

158
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
so i took my chances against

159
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,000
covet and i started walking from one

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
booth to another asking if i buy your

161
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
xero trust what i'm going to get

162
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
and i started to do a little bit of

163
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
non-scientific study what it means

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,360
the most interesting thing was

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
all of the five most common answers were

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
wrong they were

167
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
very some of them might be in a broader

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,680
idea one of the building blocks

169
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
in the and i'm actually not going to

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
talk about the uh the xero trust

171
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,440
maturity model which is another document

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,319
from national album csa

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,880
cyber and cyberspace and cyber security

174
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
and infrastructure security agency there

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
is a document which is still in draft

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
version about that i'm not going to talk

177
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,639
about that

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
but the most important thing is when you

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
look the commercial space you are in a

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
situation where what is being sold to

181
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,199
you is beside the point most of the time

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
the number one password less was by far

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
the most common what they were selling

184
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
and even if when i went to some of the

185
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
company's websites where they had better

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
i better um answers and more

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
realistic answers what zero trust is in

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,879
their website

189
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,520
when you speak on a show floor

190
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
um

191
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,479
the answers were basically

192
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,879
mostly wrong so

193
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
i also had because i do like beer i had

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
a conversation with people like why you

195
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
are doing this and basically it is well

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
everybody wants to buy a solution they

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
don't want to hear this is a journey

198
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,879
they want to have something which i can

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,120
buy it's a zero trust i implement it

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
next month check box zero trust

201
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
compliance archit of course that is

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
absolutely not true

203
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,240
but the

204
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,599
most important interesting is if you

205
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
look the cornerstones of the definition

206
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
of zero trust

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
they were starting to show

208
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
a little bit in top ten

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
so we are very far away

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
from being able to go

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
to as a

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
purchase manager as a ciso who doesn't

213
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
have a technological background and

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
that's another part which is always

215
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
eye-opening to go to

216
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,680
rsa to realize how few of the scissors

217
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
actually have a security background most

218
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
of the people are right now more in the

219
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
sales oriented mode their background is

220
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,279
marketing sales

221
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,800
operations

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
they don't have an understanding so

223
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
they're

224
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
they are in a managerial position which

225
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
is always needed

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
but they don't have understanding if

227
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
somebody is going to sell them what this

228
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,279
actually means from for their

229
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,959
corporation what they are buying and

230
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,480
what they should be paying attention to

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
of course this is where it all comes

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
from

233
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
everybody has their own favorite layer

234
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,560
of the

235
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
model

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
and everybody's trying to sell you

237
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,600
something which is helping to ser to

238
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,200
secure their favorite layer of the model

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
that is driving the sales pitches the

240
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,080
network people are still selling a zero

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
trust while they are selling you a

242
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
better firewall

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
that's beside the point because zero

244
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,760
trust is edgeless networks so that's a

245
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,160
that's one thing where you immediately

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
know well now we are talking about

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,160
a

248
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
at the best partial solution but if you

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
think about it in in a ideological and

250
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
philosophical way

251
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
you are selling something which is

252
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
philosophically wrong

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
we have learned so much during ukraine

254
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
war and as much as i hate the war

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
it's it's always good to understand the

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
lessons learned

257
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,720
this is a good example how we already

258
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
knew that we misplaced trust into the

259
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
network and we are trusting net network

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,640
too much based on what the network knows

261
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,839
about you

262
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,320
and and allow that to guide your

263
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,880
security decisions

264
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
when the war started a

265
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,160
eight or nine small isps in russia got

266
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
blocked

267
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,160
and it shouldn't be having this effect

268
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,399
but the effect was this is the number of

269
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,440
tweets

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
about anti-vaxxing messages in targeting

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
canada trapping so now we're in a

272
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
situation where literally by trusting

273
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
the network

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
you have been they have been allowing a

275
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
massive impact in a social

276
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,440
media messaging to pass through based on

277
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
unfounded trust on the network and

278
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
unfounded trusted on on the parameters

279
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
as number is the most cruel sum way of

280
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
thinking this but this is a just a

281
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
symptomatic if there is this kind of

282
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
impact coming from this kind of a

283
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
mistrust you can only imagine what the

284
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,160
impact is in more nuanced uh approaches

285
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
of course you start to see it only took

286
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
two days basically three days before the

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
traffic started to find another ways to

288
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,199
spread

289
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,839
so zero trust is never about fixing

290
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,399
one layer and trusting the others to

291
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
provide you something you have to

292
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
distrust the whole

293
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,360
stack because that is what zero trust is

294
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
all about zero trust

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
is not a word which you can add it's not

296
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,639
something you can

297
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,200
a put into you in front of your layer

298
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,079
and make it more trustworthy

299
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
because they're layers itself while they

300
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
are useful for both from network design

301
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,279
a point of view

302
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,880
for us to understand the structure of

303
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
the network when you look from a data

304
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
flow point of view

305
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
it has actually started to lose meaning

306
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
zero trust was driven by

307
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
the as ideology why it was started to be

308
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
so massively adapted it was driven by

309
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
two mega trends

310
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
first was cloud and second was bring

311
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
your own disaster also called bring your

312
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,880
own device

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
which already blurs that

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
the the castle a mod model doesn't work

315
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,079
because now you're allowing devices

316
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
which are not from your origin

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
and can contain things out of your

318
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
purview and under your control into your

319
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
corporate network at the same time

320
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
you're placing your assets

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,360
outside of your

322
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
mouth outside the firewall so we are

323
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,360
already in a situation today where a

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,160
typical enterprise and in enterprise i

325
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
don't exclude government from the

326
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
definition of enterprise government

327
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
agencies or offices they are enterprise

328
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
as anything else regardless of the

329
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
government

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
so

331
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,959
the if you are asking

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,360
from a enterprise

333
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,399
do you know where your data actually is

334
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,160
if the answer yes that means they're

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,040
lying

336
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
because they don't it is it's living in

337
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
a virtual environment it's living in the

338
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,839
containers it's living in in other host

339
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,240
systems in a devices outside of their

340
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
control

341
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
they don't know where the data is so

342
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
hence how you can even think about the

343
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
previous paradigm of having the castle

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,839
or mod

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
parameter defense approach to be any

346
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
shape or form relevant

347
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,519
for today's world i mean it's irrelevant

348
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
for the crime organization point of view

349
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
but it's not

350
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
relevant for the

351
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,279
defender's point of view

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,279
because you don't organizations lack

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,199
completely visibility today know where

354
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,320
the crown jewels are they have no idea

355
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,399
where a particular crown jewel is

356
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
geographically where it is legislative

357
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
because it might not be even in a

358
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,120
continent they think it is

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
uh and at the same time they don't know

360
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
in what kind of environment i know what

361
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
kind of governance model it is today

362
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
and we don't even start from talking

363
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
about security we just don't know where

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,600
the hell it is

365
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
one more thing which is so important in

366
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,639
the definition of

367
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,320
xero trust and which is a new thing

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
coming to this mix

369
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
is the

370
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
software supply chain security

371
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
so when we look how governments are

372
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
looking right now as a regulatory point

373
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,720
of view from regulatory point of view

374
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
the zero trust they are starting to

375
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,360
increasingly include the uh software

376
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
supply chain into the discussion

377
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
of course there are

378
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
a lot of commercial entities who are

379
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
selling a solution

380
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,199
claiming the open source when they have

381
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
only open source the sdk part

382
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
and obviously this is not anything else

383
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,079
than a snake oil deplore the definition

384
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,320
of open source

385
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,399
we are now starting to understand the

386
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
open standards and protocols their value

387
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
and meaning in a zero trust architecture

388
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,199
world

389
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
but that's only starting right now

390
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
and of course the one where this is

391
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,519
going is interrupt interoperability

392
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,720
because the the same way as the previous

393
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
model was fragmented the if you don't

394
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,519
have interoperability you are just

395
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,519
replacing a fragmented model with

396
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
another fragmented model we have to

397
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,639
bring a unity because no enterprise

398
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,680
today of any reasonable size is working

399
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,000
on a single architecture single solution

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
most importantly if we look where the

401
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,000
whole definition of xero trust came from

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
we are still in the paradigm

403
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,680
of

404
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,040
people not understanding that how hot so

405
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
how the definition between hardware and

406
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
software has been blurring so zero trust

407
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,079
is still looked to be a software-centric

408
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,680
model

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,720
and

410
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
not taking into account the elements of

411
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,759
a what is living in the embedded system

412
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
how much code

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,000
is living in a hidden firmware how much

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
micro code is how much all of this is

415
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
living inside of the systems so

416
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
eventually and this is my prediction we

417
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
will be evolving more towards

418
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
understanding that the software supply

419
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
chain is a supply chain and that will

420
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
have to include open

421
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,839
hardware as part of the concept

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
now

423
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
if we look about where we are today

424
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
today

425
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,799
as a bastardization

426
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,760
of a

427
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
russian proverb trust but verify which

428
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
was by reagan

429
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
it really today is sign in and then

430
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
ignore trust and maybe verify later

431
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
and that is the opposite of what zero

432
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,760
trust is zero trust is never trust and

433
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
always verify

434
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
the key part is

435
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
always verify it means that the initial

436
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,559
login the initial signing in the initial

437
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,200
getting in the system is just one

438
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,559
transaction

439
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
it is only meaning that you got to the

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,600
place where you can start to send

441
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
requests

442
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
now when you send requests every request

443
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
can have to be mapped against multiple

444
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,160
different parameters so you have to

445
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,559
validate even when five seconds ago your

446
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
policies were were accepting that it's

447
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
the past has the policy has changed

448
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
since the last time but also in the

449
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,039
edgeless network because you cannot

450
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
assume any trust to based on where you

451
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,720
are based on what the infrastructure

452
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
knows you have to validate all of that

453
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
again

454
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,520
and the context also means that you have

455
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
to think about and the system has to be

456
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
thinking is this a behaviorally

457
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
acceptable

458
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
it's okay if you ask this document

459
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,480
uh five in a in afternoon

460
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,559
and you ask that one document and maybe

461
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,160
a couple of other documents but what if

462
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,960
you ask that document and hundred other

463
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,240
documents five in the morning is that

464
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,679
behaviorally something which should be a

465
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
red flag or not

466
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,559
so the only way we can get this done

467
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,840
is by

468
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,720
tokenization of security

469
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,679
if you are

470
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
bringing tokenization that allows you to

471
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
start to run an identity based security

472
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
an identity here is not the user

473
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
identity is everything everything needs

474
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
to have an identity uh the user

475
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
the device the instance the process but

476
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,160
also you have to have identities to the

477
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,720
subjects so you have to have an identity

478
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
to all the crown jewels and that allows

479
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
you to do a mapping model

480
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,480
this is leading into

481
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
the the most fundamental part of zero

482
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,480
trust if you take zero trust tools

483
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,400
and you don't change the way you are

484
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
thinking about security you're probably

485
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,799
going to do a disservice and weaken your

486
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
security because now you are opening

487
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,120
with a tokenization new attack service

488
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
new attack vectors which you need to

489
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
deal separately

490
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
you cannot when you have a token he said

491
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
well you cannot live still in ldap world

492
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
and think about if i disable this

493
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
account i'm done and that

494
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,679
thing whatever it is that process that

495
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,919
instance of that user is locked out it

496
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,840
doesn't work that way so we have to

497
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,400
think about the whole model we have to

498
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
start thinking about our crown jewels

499
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
and we have to think about how

500
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
this works

501
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
most importantly as a secretary

502
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,559
practitioners and as a security

503
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,120
community members one thing which

504
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
we have been lacking and we are still

505
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
lacking is the usability study studies

506
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
of security

507
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,840
if we make security which is unusable

508
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,200
the users

509
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,840
the end users the system everybody will

510
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,919
find a way around it

511
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,120
because

512
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
the convenience will always win over

513
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
security

514
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
and what

515
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
from that point of view zero trust when

516
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,080
we are bringing in a tokenization

517
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
is a massive opportunity for us as a

518
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
secular community to think about

519
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,679
the end user think about how we make the

520
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,039
security

521
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
to work with the end users in such a way

522
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,880
that the end user doesn't feel the pain

523
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
and because the end user again will be

524
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,320
that will be driving a dropbox problem

525
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,720
you will have unauthorized drop boxes in

526
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
organization and whatnot they are all

527
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,679
symptoms of security being getting in

528
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
the way of the people who need to have

529
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,400
an access to data and they are only

530
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
seeing that

531
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
as a prohibitor of them to achieve the

532
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,760
goals

533
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
set to them

534
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,320
so again the philosophy is used instead

535
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
of looking your parameter your servers

536
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
your firewalls you have to be looking

537
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
what are my crown jewels and the crown

538
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
jewels are

539
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,159
digital assets

540
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
and they have workflows

541
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,640
actually the crown jewel very seldom has

542
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,840
a human face it's it's the crown jewels

543
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
are what you're guarding

544
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
again you have to give away from

545
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
everything you're trusting today which

546
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,159
is what your infrastructure knows

547
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
also you have to think about in a way

548
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,520
that even when you are allowing user the

549
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
users that can start to be malicious

550
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,039
so by accepting user or the process can

551
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,280
turn to be emalicious so you have to be

552
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
continuously looking into those

553
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,159
aspects

554
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,640
and last but not least

555
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
privacy and anonymity has to be

556
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,799
preserved while you are using strong

557
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,400
identification

558
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
those two things cannot be competing

559
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
against each other we all have rights to

560
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,240
privacy we all have rights to anonymity

561
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,960
in european union we have a law right to

562
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
be forgotten

563
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
so

564
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,400
you have to be able to coexist with a

565
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,760
strong identification of everything

566
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
and remember when i say everything it

567
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,520
also means because also now the crown

568
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,440
jewels the files the digital assets has

569
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
their own ids

570
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
how we make these co-existing and and

571
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
there are a lot of solutions for that

572
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,919
but if we do if we lose the if we are

573
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,720
this is a danger zone also if we don't

574
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,120
think about the privacy and anonymity

575
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
requirements when we are looking into

576
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,400
the path and journey to um

577
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,880
to zero trust we are missing the point

578
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,159
so i said this is a great quote called

579
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
rush uh called rush we are in a

580
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
situation where

581
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,240
the most important part to convey to our

582
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,360
organizations where wherever we work

583
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,400
is that zero trust is not a product zero

584
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
trust is not the solution so zero trust

585
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
is not something you can buy

586
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
it's a journey

587
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
the however we define zero trust today

588
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,559
is going to be different than what we

589
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,320
think zero trust is five years down the

590
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,279
road it's going to be evolving and we

591
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
already have an outdated model

592
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
because

593
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
the way we define

594
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,400
zero trust today was defined before

595
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
pandemic before ukraine war and all of

596
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,919
these are crate accelerators

597
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,279
the

598
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,000
pandemic was a great accelerator

599
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
which caused an adaptation

600
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,880
to remote working it caused a changes of

601
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
information past it actually threw away

602
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
our heuristic models so a lot of the

603
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,559
security principles our automated

604
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,440
security is working on today are not

605
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,039
actually working

606
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
we are still we haven't updated the

607
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,039
heuristic models which are inherently in

608
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
the system and for that reason we are in

609
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
a situation where

610
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
if the light remains green even when it

611
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,400
should go yellow or red

612
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,520
so zero trust will take time zero trust

613
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
will be evolving we will have a new

614
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
requirements

615
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,799
and most important requirement is to

616
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,840
change your

617
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,480
thinking just to go through a few things

618
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
so this is the document i was mentioning

619
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
this is the 800-207

620
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,200
zero truss architecture

621
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
by national institute of standards and

622
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
technology as you see there is the

623
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
document history if the final version

624
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,440
was august 2020 the or the first draft

625
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,919
version was 2018.

626
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
so this document

627
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
while it is better than anything else we

628
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,000
have today as a standard it's still

629
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
starting to show its age

630
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,320
most importantly if you read through

631
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,640
this document and compare it to the

632
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,120
solutions to be sold to you

633
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,240
you it's a it's blatantly obvious it's

634
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,799
that the solutions sold to you are not

635
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,559
meeting the requirements

636
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,720
so if you are in a position of making

637
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
recommendations

638
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,840
then

639
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,279
familiarizing

640
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,159
with this standard is key

641
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,240
document to understand what united

642
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
states government and other governments

643
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,039
who are implementing this standards for

644
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
example common criteria countries they

645
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,679
all are requiring it so i would say

646
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,799
today

647
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,919
give or take 30 countries are looking

648
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,760
this document as the key document

649
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
how this current

650
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,320
earth started it was may 12th this is

651
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,000
the executed order 14028

652
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
which is uh was mentioned in a name of

653
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,600
the speech

654
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
this document

655
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,159
has a number of things which are i would

656
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,679
say

657
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,440
untraditional

658
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,600
and good

659
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
usually when you have executed order

660
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,559
when you are having mandate it is

661
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
how the federal government will work

662
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,400
because that is the traditional way of

663
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,159
thinking this and that's the primary

664
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
focus and authorization

665
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
but already this document is calling

666
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,320
a wider cooperation between public and

667
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
private sector

668
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
recognizing

669
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,600
that how much of the government

670
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
functions

671
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,880
are outsourced and how actually in that

672
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,919
sense

673
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,840
a lot of times government

674
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,039
is not even self-aware the extent of

675
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,320
the

676
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
outsourcing

677
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
this was followed by

678
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
the office of budget management releases

679
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,880
the federal strategy

680
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
and now you see the zero tracks

681
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,799
architecture already on the headline

682
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,880
this is putting even more pressure

683
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,000
towards

684
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,320
the private industries to comply if they

685
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
want to do business with the federal

686
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,120
government

687
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,840
you not all businesses need to do

688
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,440
business with federal government but

689
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
this is also

690
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
was a the

691
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
launching

692
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,919
uh shot

693
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,360
for a number of other governments to

694
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,919
pick up their pen and start to look into

695
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,679
the uh

696
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
into the standardization if we go back

697
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,240
to here we already see that for example

698
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,159
japan is involved already in this

699
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,840
document first

700
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
so

701
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,679
the implementation is required to be

702
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
complete by end of physical year 24. so

703
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,240
there's also a deadline set

704
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
if you want to look what the strategy

705
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
document is itself this is the tragedy

706
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,279
document and this is the part where a

707
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,279
lot of other governments are looking

708
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,200
into this document and see what part of

709
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,640
this strategy is applicable and how to

710
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,880
implement that to their respective

711
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
governments like european unions right

712
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,159
now look

713
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
so this is going this is the document

714
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,720
where you understand

715
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,799
what what the overall strategy looks

716
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
like and that is 29 pages for strategy

717
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,159
document it's not very long

718
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,240
it's a fun reading

719
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
gives you good sleep

720
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,279
well not actually but a uh

721
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,200
it it's one one way of getting

722
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
understanding where we are going and

723
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,559
this is only one of the milestones

724
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
because this is a the follow-up document

725
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
there's a lot of nunes this is uh uh

726
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
publishing

727
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,919
the uh

728
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
executive order section four tasks and

729
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,159
timelines follow-up so

730
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,679
unlike a lot of

731
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,960
times when a government is issuing a

732
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,919
guidance or requirement and it just goes

733
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,159
in a way and there's no follow-up

734
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,039
nobody's following timelines recessor in

735
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,000
this case there is a published this is

736
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,880
these all are in in this website there's

737
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
published follow-up and deadlines and

738
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
the train is going

739
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,640
i have to say personally that when the

740
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,440
26th of uh

741
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,559
january

742
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,200
the strategic document was issued

743
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,840
less than two weeks from that i was in a

744
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,200
series of conference calls with a lot of

745
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,159
government bodies and their their uh

746
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
private sector consequences where it was

747
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,559
already started to be hammered down to

748
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,360
the private sector players what is what

749
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,039
we want you to do

750
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,120
and how late in game you are if you

751
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
haven't started that if you if you

752
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
didn't start your your certification

753
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,559
this or process that you are already

754
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,000
pushing your your luck to be compliant

755
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,720
so

756
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
again this has been a strongly

757
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
government has been strongly helpful for

758
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
private sector to understand what they

759
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,880
are expected to do what is the deadline

760
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,679
and by the way we have eyes on you this

761
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,679
is not something which will go away and

762
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,640
be forgotten

763
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,399
and the more to follow this is

764
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,760
again

765
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
a widely followed

766
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
area there is a lot of sector-specific

767
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
follow-ups

768
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
a industry-specific follow-ups

769
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
this is something where

770
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,399
a lot of government attention is brought

771
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,799
to you and again

772
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,559
the point here is

773
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
i think government is here just

774
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
asking something to be done which should

775
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
be done anyway they are not imposing

776
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,000
something unreasonable or extra burden

777
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
we are in a situation where we cannot

778
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,039
live

779
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,360
without this

780
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
so it's all about identities

781
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
the first year is your identity

782
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,799
then you authenticate the identity

783
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,200
then you contextualize every request and

784
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
every single time

785
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,799
you have a new request you go through

786
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,120
this process unless there's a specific

787
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
reason

788
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,159
not to go through the whole process and

789
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,919
say you trust for the next two minutes

790
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,600
or what not

791
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,840
you grant the minimum possible

792
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,679
privileges

793
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,559
so you

794
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,279
analyze the context of the request then

795
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,760
you determine what is the minimum

796
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,600
possible

797
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,360
privileges which you

798
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,039
are required to grant

799
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,000
to

800
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
enable that

801
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
request to go through

802
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
and then automatic generation once the

803
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
request is done once the purpose done

804
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
automatically generate the degenerate

805
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,720
and remove the privileges don't let them

806
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,279
hang around unless they are there's a

807
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,919
reason because you're still assuming

808
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,880
that while that

809
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
request was reasonable at the time when

810
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,919
it was given

811
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,000
the once the permissions have been

812
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,159
granted the user process instance

813
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,399
the device whatever it is you have

814
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,679
granting it to

815
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,440
will be

816
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
having an opportunity to turn malicious

817
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
and misuse the privileges as granted so

818
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
privileges

819
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
are different than trust

820
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,480
and

821
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,640
as mentioned before tokenization is the

822
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,600
only way we can get this done

823
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
and tokens again can be copied spoofed

824
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,240
replay attack we all know all the tricks

825
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
in the book

826
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,960
so once we say token now we we open

827
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,919
ourselves to a whole new area of

828
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,840
security which we have to think

829
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,600
through if you look how the tokens were

830
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,320
used originally they were used inside of

831
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,200
trusted network or they were used as the

832
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
augmentation

833
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
of the infrastructure security

834
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,559
say

835
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,399
microsoft networks

836
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,360
for example uh so the point here is we

837
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,279
cannot even re uh we have to rethink

838
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,919
the token the concept of token how it

839
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,960
works in this kind of environment

840
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
so this is just a

841
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,360
recapping again because repeat

842
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
repeating the same thing is always a

843
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,880
good idea

844
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,919
always assume everything is hostile

845
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,679
don't let

846
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,320
don't give a token this is a token for

847
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,960
the next 365 days and assume it's good

848
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,880
because the time to leave for the token

849
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
or expiration hasn't gone you have to be

850
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
looking this from the completely

851
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,799
different point of view tokens can

852
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,320
always be copied

853
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,800
tokens can always be misused and even if

854
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
the token arrives from a trusted network

855
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,079
which shouldn't be trusted

856
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,200
that is no excuse

857
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,918
humanly we are we now we come to the so

858
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,199
at the philosophical part we are always

859
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
assuming in an old model that once you

860
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,679
have authenticated

861
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,040
you can trust

862
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,280
but authentication authenticated is very

863
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
different concept and trust

864
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,918
so if you are

865
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,239
knowing that this is a doctor evil it

866
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,000
doesn't change the fact it's evil

867
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,440
sometimes you need to speak with the

868
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,359
doctor evil and it's good to know that

869
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,079
it's not somebody else

870
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
but authentication is not trust and all

871
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,239
is fair in love and and war and stealing

872
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,079
your digital assets

873
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,359
so

874
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,440
we have to remember this tokens are not

875
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
an intricate

876
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,520
implementation of trust it's not a

877
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,200
something you can you i have this

878
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,040
challenge coin hence

879
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,640
trust me i've worked three for that

880
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
agency we all know that doesn't work

881
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,440
that way

882
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,400
this all comes from the fact that we are

883
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
not thinking critically and because we

884
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,480
are not thinking critically the code we

885
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,400
write is not shrinking critically and

886
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,040
these are systems we design

887
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,599
are not thinking critical

888
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,280
and it all comes from the fact that we

889
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,839
all want to believe

890
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,000
that we can think like the enemy that's

891
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,119
really hard

892
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,040
and the problem is

893
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,640
most of the time we are thinking how we

894
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
would love our enemy to think but it's

895
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,880
called enemy for a good reason

896
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,119
it's because we don't have a

897
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,200
consensus with the enemy this is how you

898
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
should be playing this game

899
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
because the enemy your adversary in

900
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
their own mind they think they are the

901
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,440
good guys

902
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,160
nobody goes in the front of the mirror

903
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,520
every day and say i'm the evil no

904
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,359
whatever is the excuse

905
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,400
whatever is the way you are

906
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,280
able to turn and think that you are a

907
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
good guy you are the good guy

908
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,440
and this is the major part where our

909
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
human mind and our monkey brain

910
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
is misleading the way we think about

911
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
security because we think if i'm good

912
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
hence the other person has to be evil if

913
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
i'm a defender

914
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,880
then the other person must have a moral

915
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,960
dilemma my moral

916
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
a thing they have to overcome because

917
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
they are attacking me and they're trying

918
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,119
to steal my stuff that doesn't work that

919
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,079
way

920
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,599
and we're now talking about not

921
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,359
curiosity we're talking about the real

922
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,680
cyber war and real

923
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,560
cyber crime a criminal enterprise nation

924
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,599
state

925
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
they still have their own mission and

926
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,880
they think they are the good guys

927
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
we

928
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,079
humans are so successful in the planet

929
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,160
because humans we build communities

930
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
and because we build communities

931
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,440
the

932
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
the real thing is we trust we

933
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,599
interestingly trust each other until

934
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,520
proven otherwise

935
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
because we are being building

936
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,079
communities that also means everybody

937
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,520
even the people who have critical

938
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,040
thinking they will they will go native

939
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,280
eventually we all will go native

940
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,599
critical thinking is so unnatural for

941
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,040
humans

942
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,280
that you have to cherish you have to put

943
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
a lot of effort as a secretary

944
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,839
practitioner to keep your powder dry to

945
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,440
be able to think critically

946
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
because

947
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
we all have our neighbors we all have

948
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,880
our hacker friends we all have the

949
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
people we drink beer with

950
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,680
and all of that is based on trust we

951
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
give our credit card the bartender and

952
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,880
we we trust that there is a social

953
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,599
contract we are all the time every

954
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,119
action we do

955
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,800
even when in advertising and say

956
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
everything is a negotiation we are

957
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,280
actually everything is based on trust

958
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
and because of this average system we

959
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
built

960
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,960
has a flow of over trusting because that

961
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,760
comes from us

962
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,640
so

963
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,079
the last but not least in the

964
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,400
philosophical section is

965
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
when the consultancy companies which i

966
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
think are

967
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
mainly evil because if you're not part

968
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,599
of solution a good money can be made by

969
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,000
prolonging the problem

970
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,160
a lot of the things tanks are always

971
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,839
claiming that they are seeing and

972
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,359
they're helping you to see the future

973
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,520
but they're really looking

974
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,040
for an expected surprise they are not

975
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
very good in looking for unexpected

976
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,160
subprices

977
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,960
so

978
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
the idea of zero days the ideas of

979
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
something going drastically wrong

980
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
outside of the the

981
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
definition

982
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,960
that is not coming from them

983
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,800
so

984
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,680
zero trust the whole idea of xerodus as

985
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,839
philosophy is to get us out of this

986
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,560
vicious loop of trust

987
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,520
force us into the mindset

988
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,640
where trusting is not an option

989
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
breaking the way our monkey brain is

990
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
trying to build a community in the area

991
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
of security

992
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
making us to think

993
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,760
in a way of emulating what a critical

994
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,079
thinker would do

995
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,720
and i cannot overstress this you cannot

996
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,119
implement several trust tools and have

997
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,119
good results if you don't change your

998
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,640
way of thinking as a security

999
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,960
practitioner this is all about starting

1000
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,520
from your mind because the same part is

1001
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
your adversary

1002
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
if you talk about nation state

1003
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,839
or you you're very well motivated crime

1004
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,359
organization they are not looking your

1005
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,839
technology they are looking your mind as

1006
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,000
a defender you're leo blue team that's

1007
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
what they're after they try to

1008
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,119
understand how you think

1009
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,839
in order to go around

1010
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,078
so

1011
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,160
the part where i which i promised that

1012
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,560
instead of only telling about how world

1013
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
is horrible and broken which it is

1014
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,079
a little bit of hope how the things can

1015
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,800
be fixed and how you can do this with

1016
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
open source

1017
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,079
so

1018
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,160
when we look our current solutions and

1019
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
when we understand that

1020
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
the

1021
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
open source journey we cannot implement

1022
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,400
this overnight

1023
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,160
every single company every single

1024
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,319
secular practitioner you have to

1025
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,640
prioritize you have to understand what

1026
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,800
is the most important thing i can do

1027
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,440
first second third what is the maximum

1028
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,880
impact i can i can generate in a limited

1029
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,760
resources i have and time and what are

1030
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
the what is my journey and everybody's

1031
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
journey is different you cannot copy the

1032
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,520
company access journey and assume it

1033
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,680
works for you because everybody's

1034
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
network everybody's physical

1035
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
organization

1036
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,960
the human organization process are

1037
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,359
different it always has to be

1038
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,760
looked where is my what are my crown

1039
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,720
jewels

1040
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,359
what is my weakest point and how i start

1041
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,160
my journey to start implementing the

1042
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,079
principles of

1043
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,680
of zero trust

1044
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
step by step

1045
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,799
this also is

1046
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,359
revealing the others miracle

1047
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,839
because the cell speeches well we have

1048
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,760
this wonderful overlay network we drop

1049
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,920
it on top of your thing now you are zero

1050
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,800
trust you are good to go it doesn't work

1051
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,760
this way

1052
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,079
just you can in sometimes you can use

1053
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
reverse proxies

1054
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,319
and other technologies to bring your

1055
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,800
legacy systems under a zero trans

1056
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,960
umbrella

1057
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,280
but it's still hard and it they're still

1058
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,000
the all the the psychological the

1059
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,400
philosophical thinking has to change you

1060
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,640
cannot drop something on top of your

1061
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,520
current system and expect that to solve

1062
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,119
the problem

1063
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,160
so i'm talking about a little bit of our

1064
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,800
open source uh system project it's a

1065
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,119
number of tools called ori in the

1066
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,920
interest of a full disclosure i'm at the

1067
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
head of security researcher of ori open

1068
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
source and ora company so i'm talking

1069
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
about a little bit what what is the open

1070
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,520
source model for this first of all

1071
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,920
this is a uh this doesn't solve all the

1072
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,720
open source problems it's a permissive

1073
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
license model so everything is the and

1074
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280
it's full open source this is a

1075
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,800
everything is in the github uh the core

1076
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,599
system is in the github so there's no

1077
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,160
proprietary code hiding in a corner the

1078
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,319
only place where there's a code running

1079
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,240
in in the system is if you want to use a

1080
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,400
ori as a cloud service which has a

1081
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,280
benefits of threat intelligence and

1082
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,839
federated identities what not you if you

1083
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,560
self-host you can self-host it and we

1084
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,480
don't even know you exist

1085
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
just to give you a few ideas what size

1086
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,520
of community or is um it's almost 500

1087
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,560
contributors uh as of today it's

1088
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,640
276 million docker pools uh checked hour

1089
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,720
ago i don't know what is the decimal

1090
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,560
behind it because

1091
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,440
the uh the current power pull rate is

1092
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,800
over million pulls per 24 hours that's

1093
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,119
the reason so i actually from you last

1094
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,240
night i needed to change the five to six

1095
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,079
it's a

1096
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,800
25.5 million uh github stars

1097
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,119
and then from a telemetry point of view

1098
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,800
if you're self-hosting there is no

1099
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
telemetry coming to

1100
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,839
our site but currently 600

1101
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,599
365 billion requests

1102
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,880
served

1103
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,760
over 50 billion per month you know

1104
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,400
there's a little bit of a seasonality

1105
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,040
but this already gives you a good idea

1106
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,599
that even when we don't know the massive

1107
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,480
number which comes from the docker pools

1108
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,920
uh the one trillion uh request is going

1109
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,640
to happen this year probably october so

1110
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,040
we are in massively having the

1111
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,640
information getting the threat

1112
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,319
intelligence understanding what happens

1113
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,359
in the world

1114
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,880
the ori project itself has a four major

1115
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,800
parts it's a kratos

1116
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,920
which is a first of all everything is

1117
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,200
headless so this is there is no

1118
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,720
whatever you want to have the user

1119
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,640
interface is your user interface when

1120
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,480
you use already open source platform

1121
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,200
kratos gives you all of the things which

1122
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
user loves

1123
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,680
needs

1124
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
from password last to social signing

1125
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,000
which seems to be the craze dance of

1126
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,480
today which everybody wants to have

1127
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,440
so

1128
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,079
the question here is why would you write

1129
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,839
your own login

1130
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,440
today

1131
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,359
we all know

1132
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,680
that when you write your own login when

1133
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,640
you write your own authentication

1134
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,319
injections happen hits the fan and

1135
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,560
money is lost or user accounts were

1136
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,200
leaked or whatnot so the question here

1137
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,079
is

1138
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,440
when you think as a security

1139
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
practitioner

1140
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,160
where you put your resources it's we we

1141
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,480
all have a problem of hiring qualified

1142
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,520
people

1143
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,920
that is the the scarce resource where

1144
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,160
you put your your human resources so

1145
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,280
that they benefit best your security

1146
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,839
and your companies and protecting your

1147
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,920
jewels so kratos is handling the part of

1148
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,960
authentication hydra

1149
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,359
is again api on headless

1150
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,880
and it is the identity site so that is

1151
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,720
handling the oauth 2.0 open id connect

1152
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,520
provider etc and it is a identity

1153
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,440
management platform which provides the

1154
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,079
interoperability as mentioned before the

1155
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,079
world today is fragmented it's not going

1156
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,359
to change

1157
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,599
and it's going to be very hard to

1158
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,880
imagine a world where you can transition

1159
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,280
into a place where

1160
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
all of a sudden everything is coming

1161
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
from a single id

1162
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,319
so hydra provides you the

1163
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,000
interoperability between different

1164
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,200
identity providers

1165
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,440
oathkeeper is the reverse proxy enabling

1166
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,839
you to transition into zero trust world

1167
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,319
again it's it's a it's a networking

1168
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,640
proxy it's a side car

1169
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,440
it's

1170
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,160
it handles the authentication validation

1171
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,839
of the tokens all of that part

1172
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,359
and quito is the planet's scalable

1173
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,599
infrastructure uh an open source

1174
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,200
implementation of google sansibar

1175
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,560
research paper

1176
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
which we mentioned before

1177
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,920
so how

1178
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,119
once you are if you have a a single

1179
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,880
location single

1180
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
continent you can self-host that's great

1181
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,640
when if you are a um

1182
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,200
want to self-host but you need to build

1183
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,960
a global infrastructure this gives you

1184
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,119
that capability so i'm not trying to

1185
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,079
sell the the idea of you have to use our

1186
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,640
cloud i'm saying that this is the way

1187
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,800
you can implement yourself a

1188
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,560
planet scale infrastructure

1189
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,920
again

1190
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,680
as mentioned before

1191
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,200
first of all

1192
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,480
the snake oil cells is high

1193
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,040
question is how you implement it what is

1194
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,359
how you put your resources your your

1195
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,000
working hours to give best bank for the

1196
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,240
buck

1197
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,079
one question is when you are if you are

1198
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,400
self hosting that means you are you have

1199
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,160
to maintain not only do software

1200
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,000
upgrades in your security software but

1201
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,079
you have to maintain your exec your

1202
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
execution environment

1203
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
you and all of that

1204
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,319
you have to understand also and remember

1205
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,440
that when you do a constant

1206
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,839
contextualization i have a dyslexia

1207
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,920
contextualization of of every request

1208
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
and you do a validation of the

1209
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,800
cryptographic token every single time

1210
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,200
it's not computationally cheap

1211
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,040
so there is a lot of things you have to

1212
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,880
think about how you manage latency and

1213
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,559
jittering

1214
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,160
if you if somebody is selling your

1215
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,000
solution which doesn't give you an

1216
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,480
answer to that that's one part where you

1217
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,720
have to think about especially gaming

1218
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,119
industry for example you get very

1219
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,599
quickly in a problem where your game

1220
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
doesn't run as it's supposed to run if

1221
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,440
you haven't solved these problems

1222
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,760
and the last but not least is

1223
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
if you are running

1224
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,400
system alone you don't gain the threat

1225
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
intelligence

1226
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,079
from what might have happened

1227
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,480
is a trend in your continent trend in

1228
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,920
your industry

1229
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,520
or

1230
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,319
in the area of of identities what

1231
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,480
you don't know if the same identity has

1232
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,880
been compromised in somewhere else in

1233
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,240
some other environment

1234
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,920
that's it i

1235
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,960
hopefully

1236
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,920
end it in time yes we have four minutes

1237
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,160
for questions

1238
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,720
[Applause]

1239
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,640
and i by the way don't see anything here

1240
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
you have a question

1241
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,760
any questions from the audience

1242
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,280
can you hear me yeah there we go now

1243
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
it's on there we go

1244
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,440
hello um

1245
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,920
i do a lot of critical and water uh you

1246
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,760
know uh

1247
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,520
dyslexia getting to me too

1248
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,280
um a lot of critical power and water

1249
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
auditing um and we hear a lot you know

1250
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,359
people asking for you know let's go from

1251
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,119
you know absolutely no security to zero

1252
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,720
trust because in water we're way behind

1253
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,960
in electric we're a little less behind

1254
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,839
um

1255
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,280
but along that thread of

1256
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,359
that threat of thought um what do you

1257
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,760
think about you know for super legacy

1258
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,119
systems like that looking at like the

1259
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,359
plc's and the hmis that run that kind of

1260
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,640
stuff you know do you think that's

1261
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,960
something that it's worth standing up

1262
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
you kind of were mentioning the middle

1263
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,040
man component for xero trust is it worth

1264
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,240
standing something up there or is it

1265
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,440
worth waiting for equipment that's

1266
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,760
capable of doing it on its own

1267
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,559
so

1268
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,880
if you look the critical infrastructure

1269
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
everywhere in the world um

1270
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,440
all areas of critical it's it's

1271
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,359
hilariously outdated

1272
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,480
um

1273
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,079
at the same time it's going to be

1274
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,839
hilarious to out trade it 20 years down

1275
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,880
the road

1276
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,000
so this is a part where

1277
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,160
whatever it takes is if it's a micro

1278
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,800
supplementation and gatekeepers reverse

1279
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,000
proxies

1280
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,240
if you wait for

1281
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,480
that area of the world and especially

1282
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,800
the hardware because the today's new

1283
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,359
hardware offered is not secure

1284
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,280
you need to wait for this generation to

1285
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,040
go outdated which is 20 years down the

1286
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,359
road you cannot wait so the question is

1287
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,920
then all right this is going to be a

1288
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,000
band-aid which is bad but what is the

1289
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,400
best band-aid i can have

1290
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,280
to protect and how i implement something

1291
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,480
whether it's a reverse proxy

1292
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,119
micro-segmentation gatekeepers

1293
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,960
to help that

1294
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,440
hilariously outdated and insecure system

1295
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,760
to survive in a today's world because at

1296
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,800
the same time you hit the the uh the

1297
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,720
nail to its head

1298
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,800
if you compromise the critical

1299
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,559
infrastructure you compromise the

1300
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,000
society

1301
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,119
we did a study uh for one a geographic

1302
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,040
area and we found out that if we sat

1303
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,800
down the water service

1304
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,280
people will be unhappy in a few days

1305
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,000
time unhappy meaning they are starting

1306
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,960
dying but if you bump the silver water

1307
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,000
to the to the to the streets you have

1308
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,480
the society gone in three hours

1309
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,599
so

1310
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,359
we have to think about the real world

1311
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,599
consequences of these bli and scada

1312
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,760
systems and and

1313
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,960
the answer to to you is you have to you

1314
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,280
cannot wait because if you wait you wait

1315
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,680
20 years and then something bad will

1316
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,640
happen before that

1317
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,599
um

1318
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,000
i think we're out of time for questions

1319
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,720
but

1320
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
you can i think hari if you have time to

1321
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
speak to some folks off off the podium

1322
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,280
that would be great give it up for harry

1323
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,220
hursty one more time everyone thank you

1324
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:19,600
[Applause]

1325
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:51,429
[Music]

1326
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,400
so

1327
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:17,040
[Music]

1328
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,119
you
