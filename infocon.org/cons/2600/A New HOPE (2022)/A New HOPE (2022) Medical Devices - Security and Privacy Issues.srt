1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
how much is actually credited to that

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,799
particular account

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,399
got our hands on an employee card

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
it says no free access but

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
it's for free access so i don't really

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,720
know what they mean by that

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,400
test purposes only

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,840
basically this one is expired so we

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,599
weren't able to use it at all but when

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
we swiped it through

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
welcome to another evening at hope we're

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800

medical devices are everywhere

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
and they are just getting more complex

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
less secure and easier to build all the

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
time

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,280

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,440
embarrassing enough trust me

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,519
oh yeah you know i'm the daughter of

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
sound man and i forgot that so this is

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
my first time speaking at a conference

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
at all i usually run them

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
for like 30 years

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,120
so

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
thank you all for attending our talk

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
um jim will be attending um he asked

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
actually to call and i i asked to limit

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
it just to the question and answer so if

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
you have questions you might want to ask

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
jim as this talk goes on think about

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,680
them

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,720
but

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
we'd prefer questions first too because

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
he doesn't speak very well he had a bad

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
stroke

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
anyway those are our rules they're very

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
minimal

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,239
i don't know if i call them rules

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
they're not really wrong

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
and we were gonna play you the cool he's

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,480
dead jim compilation but

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
um many people reported that was too

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
morbid he is not dead

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
jimmy joke it's a joke it was actually

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,239
his request yes

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
but it's a joke oh look there's all the

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,599
details about me that i probably said

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,480
half of

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
so i have been hacker me almost since

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
birth my dad was at bell labs in the 60s

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
it was inevitable basically he taught me

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,280
how to take things apart and look at

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
them and put them back together

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,159
ah

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,200
i love to do that anyway um

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
my first speaking

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
uh engagement was with the amateur

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
computer group of new jersey when i was

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
10. i demoed a cool we had a digital

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
sound crossing chip processing chip

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
we went among the first people to get

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
one and we put it in our trs-80 and then

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
we could play four-part harmony music

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
and no one ever heard anything like that

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
before so we programmed it me and my dad

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
and then i demoed it

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,799
so

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
anyway um been a part of this crowd

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
since the early 90s pardon not work if

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
anybody knows what that is off the hook

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
sometimes decades passed

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,639
and

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,360
as

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,880
we've already heard too much early hope

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,040
um i also was

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,600
momentarily half a second famous for

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
paging the white house paging

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
scandal transcripts back in 19

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
i don't remember all four living

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
presidents appeared at an event in

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
philadelphia

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
and someone intercepted the paging

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
content

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
and could read it

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
and someone gave it to me at a ham fest

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
many many months later and i published

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
it online and then it went viral like

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
crazy picked up by the national news

130
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
japan

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
international wired uh

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
the white house had to put out a press

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
briefing about it oh my god we know our

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
paging trans our pagers are insecure

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
we're switching but we can't do it yet

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
whatever they did a little dance and

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
then that's it that's everything about

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
me really that's relevant except i am

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,759
also going to demonstrate my own medical

140
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
device later

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
because i push the wrong button hey this

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
is rna

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
again do you want to read your own self

144
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,560
no okay so she has also been a part of

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
the hacker crowd since the 1990s

146
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
actually at least one month longer than

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
me because she met my husband at a

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,639
meeting and he said

149
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
you're really gonna like pam

150
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
he did and he was right yes she's my

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
best friend she was the second person i

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
met at my first 2600 meeting

153
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
and she has volunteered at every hope

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
conference except for that very first

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
one

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
otherwise she would have met me there

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,479
and then whatever

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,840
uh but

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
part of original not work which was a

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
cool little hacker collective

161
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,479
and

162
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,280
this is really cool early user satan at

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
a university in a major metropolitan

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
city which i will not name

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,400
um

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
and ran it and got

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
i would say

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
not as severely reprimanded as i

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
expected

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
but you were reprimanded they didn't

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
like you definitely remember the yt

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
department it was in the early 90s they

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
didn't like it

174
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,600
but she still had a job

175
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
okay and then there's jim who'll be

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,919
we'll be calling in later for questions

177
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,560
and answers he's the guy who started the

178
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
reason for this talk because he has an

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
implanted defibrillator

180
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
and um

181
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
pacemaker but he also is the metro hard

182
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,199
card hacker also known as red balaclava

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
jeopardy jim he's got like three handles

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,000
okay one isn't enough for him apparently

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
uh he's also got involved he'd been

186
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,759
around the community a little bit

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,960
earlier but

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,400
didn't really get involved in meetings

189
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
until the early 90s and as we just said

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
he predicted our friendship before we

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
ever met so that's kind of cool for us

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
anyway um he has spoken at many hope

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
conferences about the metro card and

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,199
about some other stuff

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,880
and including the first and second ones

196
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,039
in 94-97

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
famous as the metro card hacker front

198
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
page of the new york times woohoo

199
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
okay

200
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
and this is the only graphic gym ever

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
designed we just thought it was cute

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
it's a doonsberry he cut and pasted our

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
faces over a dudesberry cartoon however

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
it does say nothing is sexier than a

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
geek girl on a coding run i'm the coder

206
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
in the family not him

207
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,960
but he did that

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
like 30 years ago okay oh off to me okay

209
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
let's talk about medical devices what do

210
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
we know all right so

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
um

212
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,479
we're going to talk a little bit about

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
medical devices security privacy hacking

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
and you

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
um but in case anyone wants a synopsis

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,039
of the talk i can oh here's the

217
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,360
microphone i can give it in one line in

218
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
general

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
electronic devices are not secure i

220
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
think we all know this i don't mean step

221
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,520
on any infosec people's toes but they're

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
just not secure everybody in this room

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
has a

224
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
smartphone yeah you're being it's i call

225
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
it my spy device i'm not the only one to

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
call it that they're not secure the end

227
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,639
we can all go home

228
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
don't do that

229
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,479
yeah please don't leave so

230
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
knowing that why would you want to put

231
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
something that can control your body

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
through electrodes and talk to your most

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
intimate organs and you know what would

234
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,360
impel you to do something so foolhardy

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
so there's a lot of good reasons so

236
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
we're going to start with the positive

237
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
these devices it's very appealing to

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,399
have some information about your health

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,320
these devices monitor and improve your

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
health that's what they're

241
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
supposedly designed to do

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
some can directly affect your body

243
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,480
pacemakers insulin pumps right we know

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
this these diseases monitor and manage

245
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
conditions

246
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
uh replace functionality your heart's

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,519
not doing well we're gonna make it work

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
better you're missing a limb we're gonna

249
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,120
give you a limb right we're gonna

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
implant it and and have it improve um

251
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
improve your health improve your

252
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,959
well-being if they decrease all-cause

253
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,040
mortality and they greatly increase

254
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
quality of life they do that

255
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
um since we're talking about privacy of

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
healthcare information i'm going to

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
point out i specifically have permission

258
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
jim our friend jim had heart failure

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
which is a very serious disease of high

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
morbidity and dangerous fibrillation

261
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
ventricular fibrillation

262
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,680
again high morbidity he was tried to

263
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
treat with medications very very common

264
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,560
medications don't always work so he has

265
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
now an implant that can do a better job

266
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,519
than any physician you know any kind of

267
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,959
monitoring he could live in an emergency

268
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
room and he's still going to do better

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
with an implant constantly monitors his

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
heart rate looks for deviations from

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
patterns scans for irregularities if

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
detected they can be re-synchronized if

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,640
his heart goes into a full-scale

274
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
defibrillation which is a

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,920
life-threatening event

276
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
you uh you get a shock

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
re-synchronizes restarts the heart

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
and his device is called a crt a cardiac

279
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
resynchronization therapy and

280
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
defibrillator so it does two things in

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,240
once can you say something yes yes

282
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
here's the mic

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
uh he also has this cool wand which

284
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,959
he can't find that he's supposed to

285
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
wave over his heart if he feels weird

286
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
that actually there's

287
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
it'll make a report it will immediately

288
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
report the telemetry to his doctor he

289
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,600
has a cell phone

290
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
expressly only from abbott labs for that

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
purpose no less than five feet away from

292
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
him at all times except you lost the

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
wand yeah so so we're talking about

294
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
communications right so there's so

295
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
you've got the near field communications

296
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
from the wand and then it communicates

297
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
with the phone which goes right out over

298
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,959
wireless so there's yeah that's you're

299
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,760
fine

300
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
so you've got leaks right there so pam

301
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
has this intractable chronic pain very

302
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
sad so sorry um medications help reduce

303
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
it but they can't stop it so now they

304
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,920
have spinal implants and i'm going to

305
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,079
say most implants like as in general

306
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
because i'm going to show you some

307
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
pictures of a lot they all have some

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
electrical way to connect to your body

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,519
and give it instructions in a sense they

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
all do the same thing they give you some

311
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
kind of shock in a very specific way

312
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
right you vary the power you vary the

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
pulse length um you you vary the the

314
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,040
rate and uh surprisingly at least

315
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
surprisingly to me all of these things

316
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
can do

317
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
can do things to your body that help

318
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
improve your health in in in a generally

319
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
a safe way

320
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,519
um

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,640
okay

322
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
so and her tell us about your uh implant

323
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,600
how much better is your pain okay um

324
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,519
just in a sentence though okay one

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
sentence i'm normally at an eight from

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
where the device is from here down i'm

327
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,279
at a four

328
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,839
yeah that's huge so that's a pain scale

329
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,680
that goes from being unable to do

330
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,760
anything to being functional

331
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,720
yeah functional

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
and we're happy much happier so back to

333
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720
the title jim is not dead but your

334
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
privacy may be so we all like having

335
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
good health i kind of maybe just sold

336
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,639
some of these medical devices to you

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,839
you're probably thinking of what's the

338
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
problem so my medical information leaks

339
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,120
out a little bit okay so let's start

340
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
from the basics do we want privacy right

341
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
i'm gonna start complaining that these

342
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
things leak out your medical data and

343
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
your privacy they impair your privacy

344
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
so there's a lot of people younger

345
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
people especially that feel that privacy

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
is not that important anymore who needs

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,560
it you know i don't care if somebody

348
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
knows my heart rate or my temperature if

349
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
my temperature goes up and i'm a covered

350
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,519
risk or

351
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,279
an influenza risk like that's okay i'm

352
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
going to stay home maybe somebody tells

353
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,720
me to stay home and that's good because

354
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
i didn't know

355
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,120
it's all good um however it turns out

356
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
even though that's what you you might

357
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
feel is true by by just talking casually

358
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,839
to people when people are polled and

359
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
explained explicitly what kind of

360
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,399
information is being released 95 percent

361
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
of people polled do not

362
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
want

363
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
their medical data released they want it

364
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
private so people in fact do want

365
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
privacy and they do understand when it's

366
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
explained to them they do they do feel

367
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
and understand that they don't want to

368
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
share that data which makes total sense

369
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
to me there's been studies done over and

370
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
over so let's just say that that's an

371
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,000
understood thing so people possess

372
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,240
various levels of privacy just to kind

373
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,079
of break it out they possess bodily

374
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
privacy uh as well as personal

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
information financial right territorial

376
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
so the drone doesn't come and look at

377
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
you communication privacy which we all

378
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
have lost because the smartphones um but

379
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,720
bodily privacy for the first time in

380
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
history uh is now can be accessed by

381
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
medical devices medical devices they

382
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
might surprise you include fitbits

383
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
smartphone apps and maybe it doesn't

384
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
surprise you retinal implants which are

385
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,440
have been around since um i think 2009

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
getting better all the time they now

387
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,720
have wireless communication with retinal

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
implants and they can upload data to it

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,079
that's very interesting

390
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
wireless blood pressure machines right

391
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
genome tests you might not think of that

392
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
as a medical device but it falls into

393
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
under the corpus of the data that's

394
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
provided personal health information tsa

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,959
body scans not intended as a medical

396
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,399
device but they can tell your weight

397
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,199
they can tell your height they can tell

398
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,800
your gait they can tell a lot of

399
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,880
information from a tsa body scan and

400
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
guaranteed they do not delete those

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
things

402
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,839
the collection of data from your daily

403
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
activities when you walk when you run

404
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
when you bike

405
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
when you sit how fast you type that's a

406
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
biometric uh

407
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
information that's collected when you're

408
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
on your smartphone may not seem like a

409
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
big deal okay over time your typing rate

410
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
may change and that may indicate a

411
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
mental health problem or an aging

412
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,639
acceleration so and you may not want

413
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
that information out that's too bad

414
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,040
because it's going to be out um without

415
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
your permission with or without your

416
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
permission your eye motions how do you

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,560
track what you're seeing on the screen

418
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,880
that's collected your sleeping patterns

419
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
we all know that's collected because

420
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
your phone politely goes off at night

421
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
and perks up again in the morning

422
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
personally i think this is too much

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
information but you know let's keep

424
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,560
talking all of these may be combined

425
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
with each other and correlated to come

426
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
to very surprising conclusions and

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,959
combined with health data from all other

428
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,440
medical devices so

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
that's something

430
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,079
so

431
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
again about your privacy so here's an

432
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,199
example

433
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
this surprised me i hope that you guys

434
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
find this little surprising

435
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,199
not too surprising google bought fitbit

436
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,199
okay they paid two point something

437
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
billion dollars for it

438
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
must have some value your walking data

439
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
right who cares okay so now they have

440
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,720
fitbit so they own all that data your

441
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,680
data and then they went out and bought

442
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
the um electronic health record company

443
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
ascension

444
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
this should really

445
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
irritate everyone in the room and

446
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
everyone listening to that they this

447
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
talk they bought your electronic health

448
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
records your private health records that

449
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
we were assured when this program

450
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,079
started would remain private there your

451
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
conversations with your doctor your

452
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,839
interactions with your physician all

453
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,440
your medical health data whatever you

454
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
tell them whatever prescription to

455
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
everything that what you tell your

456
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,320
doctor not only isn't private it's been

457
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
sold and it's been sold on this massive

458
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
scale it's been sold to google it's been

459
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
sold to amazon it's been sold to

460
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,480
facebook it's gone it's gone i mean it's

461
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
gone now some of you might feel well

462
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
it's probably anonymized we'll talk

463
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,320
about that

464
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
in one second so um

465
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
so here's a fun fact

466
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
five days of walking data from a fitbit

467
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
or any walking app

468
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
they don't have to be contiguous so just

469
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
five days of your walking data can be

470
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
used that data to uniquely identify you

471
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
from a medical database of over

472
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
100 million individuals a hundred

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
million individuals of anonymized data

474
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
so you take your little fitbit you know

475
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,880
your gate however you walk around and

476
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,199
they pull out your entire medical health

477
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,959
record from an anonymized database

478
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
that's just one thing

479
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
right there's lots of data out there

480
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,359
this is just walking data um google

481
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
in addition to that google publishes

482
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
research uh regularly on how they can

483
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
use the apps that they collect from your

484
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
smartphone we're not even talking about

485
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,199
hacking or medical devices yet we're

486
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,679
just talking about medical information

487
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,720
they

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
have ways that they count as reliable

489
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
and they're published and they and

490
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
physicians agree with them i don't know

491
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
if i do i don't know if you're going to

492
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,280
after you hear this they can take your

493
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
walking gait and say that they can

494
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
predict that if you will or will not

495
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
have alzheimer's

496
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
that's weird in my opinion they can say

497
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,520
whether or not you're depressed or

498
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
whether you have any mental health

499
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
issues again this might sound really

500
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
good but think about what if they make a

501
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
mistake are we all reading in the news

502
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
now that uh this has nothing to do with

503
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
medical devices but the serotonin

504
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
reuptake inhibitors the antidepressants

505
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
that have been on the market for decades

506
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,160
uh now are being shown like oh my god it

507
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
looks like depression doesn't have

508
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
anything to do with a problem with

509
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
serotonin reuptake uh too bad you know

510
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,320
we've been prescribing all this time so

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
there are mistakes made in medical

512
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
diagnoses mistakes that the whole field

513
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
will make for decades and then somebody

514
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
will say oh no this is a new paradigm

515
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
now so what if google has an algorithm

516
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,559
that is accepted by everyone that says

517
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
you have mental health disease and

518
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,120
furthermore for public safety

519
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
you have to have this medication which

520
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
we put little rfid tags in so we know

521
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,880
whether you've taken it you're going to

522
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,640
have to show us that you've taken it

523
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
because for your neighbor or for the

524
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
community or to reduce everybody's

525
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
health costs because we're all covered

526
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,919
by insurance i find this to be a highly

527
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,919
invasive problem that i don't think

528
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
enough people are aware of so i hope

529
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,679
i've drawn a picture that makes some of

530
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,640
you say hmm is this okay is this

531
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
socially okay do i feel good about this

532
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
maybe you can't tell but i'm not a fan i

533
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,799
don't

534
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,000
yes so here's so there's medical devices

535
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
that we're going to say more about and

536
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
the ones that are implanted well they

537
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,280
have um unique ids like your phone uh

538
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
and here's the information that is

539
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
freely broadcast on by these devices

540
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
when they're used by everyone who has

541
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
any kind of medical implant that's a box

542
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,960
no it's actually showing them right okay

543
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
it's information yes oh oh yeah it's on

544
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
that if you wanted to then

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
this in for this number is on the side

546
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
everyone has unique information your

547
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,799
name

548
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,039
your name your physical address your

549
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
date of birth your social security

550
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
number with every transmission boom all

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,720
over the world wherever it goes on the

552
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
internet social security number you're

553
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,679
along with your name and physical

554
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,240
address your your um date of birth email

555
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,160
address date and location of the data

556
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
collection so if you're moving around it

557
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
doesn't have a gps it'll triangulate

558
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,360
from the towers that you're

559
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
communicating with your phone number

560
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
your fax number your medical chart

561
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
identifier which is a unique number uh

562
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,120
your physician and or hospital medical

563
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
insurance carrier the ip address that

564
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
the information like a ping information

565
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
how it was transmitted the unique

566
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,440
identifier of the medical device and its

567
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
serial number and a software version and

568
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
the data command communication path or

569
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,559
tower id

570
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
that's just normal that's just what they

571
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,640
send out that's a lot of information i

572
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
don't normally even send out my social

573
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,679
security number in like email or text i

574
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
mean hope nobody in this room does but

575
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
this is that's by itself and i don't

576
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,480
like to to disclose that so now this is

577
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
this whole corpus of information that's

578
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
just the header that's just the header

579
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
then there's the then there's the

580
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
payload of the actual medical

581
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
information

582
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,039
so

583
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
jim is not dead but your security may be

584
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
and this is the security of the device

585
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
is what i meant by that so it turns out

586
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
that these have been studied and

587
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
probably many people in the room because

588
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
people have been chatting with me for

589
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
two days now about this a lot of people

590
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,080
are aware of the different flaws in

591
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,440
different devices

592
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
there's not a medical device out there

593
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,039
that doesn't have a security flaw boom

594
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,200
okay done so they all have these

595
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
security flaws and there's tons of legal

596
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
cases i mean i have some references

597
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
embedded in my talk i'm happy to share

598
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
the slides but

599
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
all you have to do is take a phrase and

600
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
google it it's like not a secret so they

601
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
have tons of security flaws there's tons

602
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,760
of legal cases google's been sued for

603
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
leaking data i don't even think they've

604
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
had it for more than five years i've

605
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
already had some some large cases about

606
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,559
that that they've lost

607
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,720
and the reported incidence of violations

608
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
per year

609
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,520
has gone up it does not decreasing so

610
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,760
these things are revealed right various

611
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
hacks or abilities to reprogram or

612
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
different problems security flaws and

613
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
there may be some are fixed and then you

614
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
get new ones and maybe some persist for

615
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
years even though they're known security

616
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
problems

617
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,039
separate from this fact is what we've

618
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,440
already said that your health data is

619
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
shared and sold uh from these devices

620
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,919
and from many other places somehow while

621
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
also complying with hipaa laws so you

622
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,600
start to get the feeling that these

623
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,039
things are happening

624
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,440
and we're not really protected it seems

625
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
to me a no-brainer you got a medical

626
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
device you got medical records you got

627
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,679
this private stuff should it be sold no

628
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,280
let's have a look against that because

629
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,120
that doesn't seem right i i don't know

630
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
how much you have to think about it when

631
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
you meet to make laws

632
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,280
but yet we're not protected um and

633
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,640
anonymized data as i showed is a fantasy

634
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
this is people can say well we anonymize

635
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
it so don't worry about it it's okay we

636
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,600
got this under control

637
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
it's not possible there's no anonymized

638
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,679
data there's no anonymized health data

639
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,679
um so we just said that your walking

640
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
data can identify you and i i pointed

641
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
out that i think that's really awful and

642
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
your phone every phone now has an app

643
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,919
for walking data did you ever wonder

644
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
like why it's like the weather app which

645
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,200
i think a lot of you may have heard is

646
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,760
also famously insecure and steals a lot

647
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
of data while it's serving you the

648
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
weather

649
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
that it doesn't need

650
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
except you know to steal it and resell

651
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,159
it so your phone collects your walking

652
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,080
data did you turn that off i turned mine

653
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,919
off but it doesn't matter it doesn't

654
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,760
matter you can tell me you turned it off

655
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,320
but in fact they collect it anyway when

656
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,240
you turn it off what it means is that

657
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,600
you don't see it

658
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
right uh it doesn't mean that they don't

659
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
see it they collect it and it's either

660
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,559
in the eua when you get your phone

661
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
because people are going to say no if i

662
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
say no they can't collect it they can't

663
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
collect it it's too valuable not to

664
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
collect it's something that you can't

665
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
trace and you can't prove and they can

666
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
sell if you can't protect it yourself

667
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,200
and you can never prove that it's been

668
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
stolen i guarantee you that someone's

669
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,279
taking it that's just common sense um

670
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,600
and it's too easy it's too valuable and

671
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
it's too easy

672
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
so there's another study there's tons of

673
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,960
these studies that show how you can

674
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
de-anonymize data

675
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
but i liked this particular mit

676
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
study and this is an article it's not

677
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
really research paper from 2013 okay

678
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
from 2013 which means things have gotten

679
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,559
better since then and what they found in

680
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
this paper what did i say you said

681
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
better the worse you know what i mean

682
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
it's after 10.

683
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
so what they found is four

684
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,159
imprecise data points

685
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,480
over a population of 1.5 million

686
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,919
individuals allows unique identification

687
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,480
of who the data points belong to 95 of

688
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,000
the time and what i liked about this

689
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
study is that they specifically made the

690
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,880
data points imprecise now we'd have to

691
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,919
go back to the paper i actually don't

692
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,600
remember what the four were i remember

693
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,080
one of them was an insecure location so

694
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,919
they would triangulate the position with

695
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
the towers but they didn't use precise

696
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
location they used like a radius of

697
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
several blocks or something um so

698
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,520
there's an imprecise location i think

699
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
that was imprecise i don't want to say

700
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,799
too much because now i'm guessing some

701
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,279
kind of imprecise medical data uh and

702
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,360
two other things and they specifically

703
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
designed it to be imprecise which i

704
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,559
think i just said that twice because i

705
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,039
found it so impressive um

706
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,480
and unique identification of the

707
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,799
individual 95 time and if you made one

708
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
of the measurements precise the unique

709
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
identification percentage went up to

710
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,400
almost 99

711
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,120
so

712
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,440
that's how little data you need how

713
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,159
sparse the data can be and you can still

714
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
do a unique identification this is

715
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
another way that i'm showing that

716
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
anonymized data like forget it

717
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
um

718
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,279
is somebody talking

719
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,559
is that you

720
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,080
somebody's better okay i'm going to

721
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
ignore it it's fine um so here's just a

722
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
panoply of wireless implantable medical

723
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,720
devices they're scattered all over the

724
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
body i don't really need to

725
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
i mean i'm happy to fill up questions

726
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
but you know it doesn't matter what they

727
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,720
are they all work by electrostimulation

728
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
um they're all implanted and i added two

729
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
because i thought they were very

730
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,279
interesting one is a neurostimulator for

731
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,440
headaches and it's interesting if you

732
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,600
google it i should have put a graphic up

733
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,679
because it's this long skinny thing that

734
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
just goes up your nose

735
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
and and stimulates a nerve that goes to

736
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,640
the brain and actually allows vaso

737
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
dilation so that when you have it and

738
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,240
it's for very severe headaches you don't

739
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,360
just go around sticking this thing up

740
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
your nose it's indwelling and um so if

741
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
you have a migranure or cluster

742
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
headaches and you can't treat them you

743
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,080
just put this thing well they implant

744
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,760
this thing up your nose and for some

745
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
reason i found that very amazing because

746
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
headaches can be chronically

747
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
hello can everyone can hear me right

748
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,279
you're not sleeping or anything okay

749
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,080
thank you thank you i heard that it's an

750
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
aura um and epiretinal implants oh yeah

751
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
i just got much louder epiretinal

752
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,159
implants i also find fascinating um a

753
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
colleague of mine sheila nirenberg who's

754
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
at cornell actually is one of the people

755
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,159
that's designing this so i can talk a

756
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,480
little bit more um knowledgeably about

757
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,919
this because i've actually seen it but

758
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
it's a it's a it's an implant that

759
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,679
actually goes in your eye they actually

760
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
take out all the vitreous fluid they

761
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
take out your cornea they actually dig

762
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
in there and they do this with people

763
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
who are totally blind or who have

764
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
various diseases where they you know it

765
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,000
leads to blindness and they want sight

766
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
because i can't think of another reason

767
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
that you'd let your eyeball be dug out

768
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,880
but but they work amazingly so they they

769
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
sit on your

770
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
retina and if you're blind the retina is

771
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
not working it's not sending signals

772
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,159
through your um optic nerve to your

773
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,679
occipital region and so you're not

774
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
getting any information from the

775
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
environment any photonic information

776
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,159
from the environment

777
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,520
so these these devices have been once

778
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
they're implanted people can see

779
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,760
outlines uh um and uh figures and they

780
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
can actually navigate the world they

781
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,120
can't quite drive but they can walk and

782
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
they can see things and it's an amazing

783
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,039
and this is just the first generation

784
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,880
it's like when we had black and white tv

785
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,520
and it was grainy and everything um you

786
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,799
know and you'd say well where are they

787
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,399
going to go with this and now look what

788
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
we have did somebody have a question

789
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,000
you know what i heard about that and

790
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
they had a very interesting problem they

791
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
had these companies

792
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
that uh

793
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
it was like they maintained the software

794
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
or something yeah

795
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
yeah and then those companies closed

796
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
like shut down where they had no more

797
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,240
support oh wow

798
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
wow

799
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,600
now i have this like device yeah

800
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
yeah what do i do

801
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
and that's another issue that's not even

802
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,200
in my talk that's thank you that's a

803
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,240
very good point yeah what happens when

804
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
this device like the operating system

805
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
gets outdated or the company goes out of

806
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
business or they just don't feel like

807
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
updating because they want you get a new

808
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,200
implant so thank you for bringing that

809
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
up and it's it's something to consider

810
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
you know you get your smartphone every

811
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
few years but it's a little harder when

812
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,679
it's in your body and under your skin

813
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,559
so

814
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,880
um

815
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,200
okay so i'm i hear i'm running out of

816
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,559
time so okay so meta thank you medical

817
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,159
device communication right i haven't

818
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,760
actually said anything about the way

819
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,200
that the information is getting on and

820
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,320
off these devices except by leakage uh

821
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
as i was saying earlier so i'm gonna

822
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
start with the little picture on the

823
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
bottom it's very simple and and i'm sure

824
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
a lot of people in the room are already

825
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,640
aware of this but

826
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,000
it gives a reality to the to the devices

827
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,840
so they're very simple right they have a

828
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,960
microcontroller and the microcontroller

829
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
talks um to actually five things so

830
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
there's a sensor

831
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
actuator actuators if you have like an

832
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
artificial arm and a sensor is what

833
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
you'd use to collect data and you could

834
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
have multiple sensors too so if it's a

835
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,720
defibrillator you have a sensor that's

836
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,279
maybe a pressure sensor or an electrical

837
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
um signal sensor that's telling you how

838
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,039
fast the heart is beating because that's

839
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,200
the important information so what you

840
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
also have is this information is analog

841
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
and i left this off the slide when you

842
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
transceive it it says communication

843
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
device is going to be a transceiver just

844
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
a normal transceiver um you're

845
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
transceiving you're sending digital data

846
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
so you need an analog to digital

847
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,559
converter in there that's going to

848
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,720
probably be on the controller and then

849
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,159
what else would you expect right you

850
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,159
have memory so that you can do

851
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
uh management of the data you can prune

852
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
it you can denoise it um you can

853
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
pre-process it much like the retina does

854
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,039
with the data that it gets um if you

855
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,880
have multiple channels coming in you can

856
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
fuse it to save bandwidth whatever you

857
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,720
need done there might be an ai that

858
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
makes decisions on the data you've

859
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,559
collected the frequency of the heartbeat

860
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,480
but now you have to know is it does it

861
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
pass a cut off uh where it's dangerous

862
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,399
and the device has to do something so

863
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
there's some decisions uh that are made

864
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,559
on some devices

865
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,320
um so that would happen on the

866
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,399
controller so you have the memory for

867
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,640
that right for the comp computations the

868
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,399
power supply the transceiver and the

869
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
sensor and that's pretty much it it's

870
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,200
actually very simple to get to get this

871
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
into your body oh

872
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
and we'll sort this out so the

873
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
communication frequencies that they

874
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
transmit on are going to be in the ism

875
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
band uh that would be the industrial

876
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,880
scientific medical bands and it has many

877
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
frequencies the

878
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
allure of this is that these are um

879
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,960
you don't need to be licensed in order

880
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,360
to use these frequencies so you have

881
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
this is not in much use right now but

882
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,120
the 173 these are megahertz 433 i'm sure

883
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,880
if you guys are familiar with these and

884
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,519
then the most common is the right around

885
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,880
at gigahertz um which would be 915 and

886
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,600
it's 2400 2.4 gigahertz i wrote 2400 um

887
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,720
or uh 5 gigahertz and those are the

888
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
common bands you don't need a license

889
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,760
which is makes it very easy for the

890
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
manufacturers there's bluetooth

891
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,519
communication it depends on the device

892
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,080
and devices can multiple antennas

893
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,480
there's zigbee which i don't know if

894
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
people are aware of that but that's what

895
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
your appliances use to communicate with

896
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,880
the world and i don't know about any of

897
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,799
you but you know i don't know why i need

898
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,399
to wirelessly communicate with my

899
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,360
washing machine and my fridge and i

900
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
actually had to get a fridge or fridge

901
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,880
that exploded and right during covid so

902
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
it was sort of a pretty urgent thing but

903
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
anyway i had to go out and get a fridge

904
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
and the first thing i did was i opened

905
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,320
the grill on the top and i climbed in

906
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,120
there

907
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,679
to bro to pull out the wireless antenna

908
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
which was was on its separate i mean you

909
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,279
got many of you have seen this right it

910
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,880
was on a separate chip you just unplug

911
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
it i was very pleased that i was able to

912
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,240
find it so quickly because no the

913
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,000
manufacturer wouldn't tell me like no

914
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
one would oh you can't take that out

915
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,360
okay well you can pull it out but it

916
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
turns out also this device was um

917
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,840
whatever the one i got was was a couple

918
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,399
of years old now those chips are on the

919
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
main board you can't pull them out so

920
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
easily if you disable the communication

921
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
device on your appliances they won't

922
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
work i have a problem with this too i

923
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,240
don't really know how to fix it right

924
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,360
now and that's not what this talk is

925
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,799
about but i'm making you guys aware of

926
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,519
this

927
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,480
so

928
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
okay so i'm really cutting it close um

929
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,799
they

930
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,360
they use one watt of power or near field

931
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,279
communication so now i'm gonna

932
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,000
zip through this so um this is a code

933
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,480
this can be arduino code you can go on

934
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,120
hacksterio that's what that

935
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
link is to and this is a high school

936
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
project like ninth grade or something

937
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
and you can get and all the instructions

938
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,960
on where to buy the pieces are like a

939
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
texas instrument temperature sensor and

940
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,640
an arduino you put this code in and

941
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
you've got a continuous temperature

942
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
monitoring device for yourself or your

943
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,720
cat or whatever you want to monitor the

944
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
temperature and this is just a few words

945
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,240
on what kind of sensors there are

946
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,120
so

947
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,679
what could go wrong is maybe really what

948
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
could go right

949
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,320
right we already know what can go wrong

950
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
as the whole talk was about so what goes

951
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
right um well the good thing is the

952
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,120
devices on their own rarely simply

953
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,760
misfire they they work fine right the

954
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
problem is all with the security and

955
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,080
keeping the the information oh my god i

956
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
just remembered i have some slides i

957
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,760
really want to show you guys um they're

958
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,240
based on older existing devices you know

959
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
i'm just going to skip this but that

960
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,440
that's a problem because if there's a

961
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
security problem it just rolls over and

962
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,600
yet the fda prefers you to um you they

963
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
give preferential treatment if you use

964
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,799
an existing advice you can get it

965
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,320
approved and on the market within 90

966
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,360
days so it's a it's a competing um

967
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,880
interest and the peer the person who

968
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
suffers is a consumer

969
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,200
so this slide basically just says that

970
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
when

971
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,199
companies that do threat intelligence

972
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,800
this particular company i have to say it

973
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,560
has a global network of sensors and

974
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,159
honey pots they collect a hundred

975
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,879
terabytes of data per day

976
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,440
when they do this this information

977
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,239
probing to check for security they found

978
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,440
that um

979
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,679
there was high vulnerability

980
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
with all personal health information

981
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,679
including medical devices so i'll skip

982
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
most the slide you can see the numbers

983
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,480
um medical devices

984
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
were probed and found to be horribly

985
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,520
insecure and they've been shown

986
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
repeatedly to be insecure

987
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,239
um remaining so in 2022 this i only

988
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,000
picked 2014 because this one was in all

989
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,639
the news this company norse and sends

990
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,480
they do this every year and the numbers

991
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
have not gotten any better but this one

992
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
was in the news interestingly even

993
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,159
though it happens annually and the

994
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,320
numbers stay the same not so newsy

995
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,440
anymore so um and keep in mind newer

996
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,520
medical technology and testing devices

997
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,680
radiological tests ct scanners mri

998
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
machines network attached information

999
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,359
goes out because your doctor might be

1000
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,880
remote you know you want to see what

1001
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,079
your skin is

1002
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,760
along with the rest of the world anyone

1003
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
who can intercept those packets

1004
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
i'm going to skip this on the dmca but

1005
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
i'm just going to say that somehow

1006
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,839
um the dmca weakens the security on

1007
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,720
medical devices unintended consequence

1008
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
and important it has important effects

1009
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
on making sure that none of us have

1010
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,480
really good security

1011
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
so this is i think interesting and then

1012
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
i'll end after this these are some

1013
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,079
unclassified slides these were

1014
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,040
classified uh from 2010 and the reason i

1015
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,960
find it interesting is before

1016
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
medical devices before the ubiquity of

1017
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,400
smartphones

1018
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,359
and this is a from a series of seminars

1019
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,520
that was given by the nsa paid for by

1020
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,599
your tax dollars where they were

1021
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,520
targeting high value individuals and

1022
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
they were using

1023
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
the stupidest name i can think of for

1024
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,200
finding your the corpus of your medical

1025
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
information they called it the medical

1026
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,599
pattern of life i don't know why i think

1027
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,839
that's really goofy but the point is

1028
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,000
that the nsa was interested and they're

1029
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,359
serious organization right they're not

1030
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,960
frivolous they're not fooling around and

1031
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
having a party or they're not supposed

1032
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,599
to be

1033
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,400
you know putting projects together um

1034
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,560
they're using their signal intelligence

1035
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,320
to enable what they're calling human

1036
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
intelligence and they're collecting all

1037
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,400
the medical information and i will speed

1038
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,640
through these i found these fascinating

1039
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,079
and there's a link to these that i can

1040
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,720
provide but they define medical

1041
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,480
intelligence and look at this last nine

1042
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,280
medications medical tests medical

1043
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
surgical treatments hospital and doctor

1044
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
businesses before right all this

1045
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
electronic health records you know for

1046
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
sure that's going to be in there and

1047
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
medical devices all going to be in these

1048
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
files um

1049
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,000
that they collect on a high value

1050
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,480
individual oh but wait a minute in 2010

1051
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,240
high value individuals might have been i

1052
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,359
don't know osama bin laden right but now

1053
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,920
we're all high value individuals compute

1054
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,720
power has gotten enormous compared to

1055
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,640
2010 um the the the fact is that your

1056
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
medical information has a financial

1057
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
value that makes each of us a high value

1058
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
information and it's so easy to keep it

1059
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
on each individual facebook has proven

1060
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
that right we all have a file and it's

1061
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,440
very easy to populate it with

1062
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,920
information okay i hope you guys don't

1063
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,480
mind i'm going a little over um

1064
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,359
so

1065
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,920
let's see did i go backwards yes

1066
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
so and here's from 2010 again here's

1067
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,520
their picture so clearly they're

1068
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,280
anticipating medical devices and they're

1069
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
showing that they're tiny they're

1070
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,839
embeddable they can be um

1071
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,960
uh queried covertly they have accuracy

1072
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,359
despite horror signal environments um

1073
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,200
which i interpreted to mean inside the

1074
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
body it could also mean if you're going

1075
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,520
over harsh terrain i suppose uh and at

1076
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
that time they're talking about rfid

1077
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
which is very small short range but the

1078
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,359
point is they were anticipating medical

1079
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,680
devices so now you have the nsa

1080
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
who has an interest in this information

1081
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
to me that just underscores it's

1082
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,119
definitely valuable i mean we know it

1083
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,520
but here's another proof of it

1084
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
so i'm just going to read the title poor

1085
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,119
security is just a well-known

1086
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,960
vulnerability you can see all these

1087
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
quotes and stuff but i think i've shown

1088
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,839
it to you

1089
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,880
um so what about right now in 2022 so

1090
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
i'm going to skip to this

1091
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
the second part of this slide 75 after

1092
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,880
some studies and quotes from these

1093
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,839
people and all these other things um 75

1094
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,160
of medical internet of thing devices

1095
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,760
have known security gaps this is 2022

1096
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,200
and 75 percent so i just said this they

1097
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,119
have these security gaps these are

1098
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,320
related to 40 known vulnerabilities and

1099
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
52 remain open to two known

1100
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
vulnerabilities with high and critical

1101
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,160
severity ratings that are things that

1102
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,040
were that are those are openings that

1103
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,960
can definitely be used to kill you and

1104
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,320
these were first disclosed those

1105
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,440
particular ones 2019 so i guess they're

1106
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
not that worried about it encryption

1107
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,359
some other time and now i'm going to

1108
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,960
hand it over to pam who's going to talk

1109
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
about the specific devices that they

1110
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,320
have thank you very much and we are

1111
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,240
going to go a little bit into the q a

1112
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
time sorry

1113
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,079
um so jim's device is super cool it

1114
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,079
keeps him alive okay because first it's

1115
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,560
a pacemaker that does the normal work

1116
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
and then it's a defibrillator oh my god

1117
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,480
his heart is stopping he will give you a

1118
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
very short video in a minute where he

1119
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
pretends he's having a heart attack it's

1120
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,680
very silly

1121
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,520
and then shows you what he would do to

1122
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
send the telemetry to his doctor um but

1123
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
he will also be available for q a in a

1124
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,320
few minutes um anyway that's what his

1125
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
device does and it it looks like that on

1126
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,119
the inside it's actually two separate

1127
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,280
devices then they plug them together and

1128
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
he just had a new battery he needed a

1129
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,480
new battery

1130
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,079
it's it is it's

1131
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,760
i did not want to show everyone a

1132
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,359
picture of my husband's naked chest

1133
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
sorry you would not be impressed but

1134
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
it's about that big and

1135
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,079
and then the defibrillator is actually

1136
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,160
probably about that big but

1137
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,040
you know

1138
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,359
it looks like a lump and it goes right

1139
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,800
under the skin by the way i don't know

1140
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
if you guys hear me visibly people

1141
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
surgery and then they thread the two

1142
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
leads to your heart through your your

1143
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,319
vein your i don't know if it's art of

1144
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,400
your vein but they thread it through and

1145
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,040
they use um like radio radiological like

1146
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
microwaves or not microwaves i'm sorry i

1147
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,400
don't remember what they use but they

1148
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,560
use some kind of imaging technique to

1149
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,119
make sure that they fluoroscopy

1150
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,680
what was that fluoroscopy do they use

1151
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
yes absolutely that's a lot of radiation

1152
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
yes it is they use it for mine anyway

1153
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,560
uh we don't really care about these

1154
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,400
words we just use half of them if you

1155
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,599
really want to know you can have the

1156
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
slides afterwards

1157
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,920
this

1158
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,720
yes um this is more words about how

1159
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,800
jim's device works really not that

1160
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
important but really excellent

1161
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
great research

1162
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
uh

1163
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,480
i don't know if this will work

1164
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,720
oh shoot that's not good well

1165
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,520
um

1166
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,359
i will send it out to anyone who cares

1167
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,160
but jim filmed a very silly 30 second

1168
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,920
video of himself i could probably hold

1169
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,200
it up on my phone and play it for you

1170
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,920
but um pretending to have a heart attack

1171
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
and then what he would do with his

1172
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,000
device and he didn't really remember it

1173
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
is a little sad he doesn't have any

1174
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
memory loss he just didn't remember what

1175
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,680
he was supposed to do so

1176
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
sorry

1177
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,359
okay my device however i know everything

1178
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,680
about and it's here with me and i can

1179
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,760
even demonstrate it uh

1180
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,920
it is always with me at all times

1181
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,079
because it's in my it goes from here to

1182
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,280
here

1183
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
and if anybody couldn't see that it's

1184
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
like from the bottom of my where my

1185
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
brides which is t8 if you know your

1186
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,599
spinal column issues down to my sacral

1187
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
area um and i have a cool new battery

1188
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,560
pack first i had a little test for a

1189
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,960
week that had its own tiny battery like

1190
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
a watch battery but now then they had to

1191
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,160
go in and implant a huge battery pack

1192
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
which i now have to recharge about once

1193
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,160
every 10 days

1194
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,040
so

1195
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
i have a remote control which makes me

1196
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,640
feel like i'm a robot i also have two

1197
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,800
programs which also make me feel like

1198
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
i'm a robot um i don't know if that

1199
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,760
makes me a robot i don't know show hands

1200
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,079
am i a robot if i have a remote control

1201
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,000
programmer okay

1202
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
i'm a robot i think i'm a robot i also

1203
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,720
have a lot of titanium implants uh here

1204
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,440
to hear c3 to c7

1205
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,079
uh yeah

1206
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,319
cyborg i like that that's better it's

1207
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,359
better than robot yeah okay so this one

1208
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,079
makes a lot of beeping sorry sorry sound

1209
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,079
people first it makes beeping to tell

1210
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,000
you i guess it's alive

1211
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
but what this stand out there so people

1212
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,200
can see

1213
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,040
but then it won't be by the mic i don't

1214
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
know okay so this thing

1215
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
okay now it's telling me

1216
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,839
it's telling me almost in range but it's

1217
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,960
not because my battery pack is right

1218
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,880
here

1219
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,280
and that thing blinking if you can see

1220
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,000
it

1221
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
is supposed to tell me how close it is

1222
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
okay now it realizes it's not close at

1223
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,800
all

1224
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,560
and it really should not be through two

1225
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,319
or three or four layers of fabric which

1226
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,839
it is right now

1227
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,240
but that's that's what it does this

1228
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,920
rubbery thing

1229
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,200
goes

1230
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,960
up against this thing that looks like a

1231
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,200
scar right here

1232
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,520
because i only had it done a month ago

1233
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
and it recharges my battery quite

1234
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,359
literally

1235
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,800
it easier to show oh and talk into mic

1236
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,319
about

1237
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,720
what what um

1238
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,280
not that long but hey

1239
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
uh i can show you oh wait the chargers

1240
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,839
no it's right here if you want to

1241
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,599
examine the charger you can look at its

1242
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,640
frequencies if you'd like but it takes

1243
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,319
the whole thing to to recharge itself um

1244
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,280
about four hours

1245
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,240
so this is my programmable remote

1246
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,480
i have two programs um i was on the

1247
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,920
first program for a very long time and

1248
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
then i said to my doctor should i change

1249
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,319
the program he was like you haven't

1250
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,319
changed the program yet so i did

1251
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,200
um

1252
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,040
right now it shows me the strength of my

1253
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,240
battery i don't know if you can see it

1254
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,319
but it's at three out of four dots it's

1255
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,079
pretty strong i haven't charged it for

1256
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,680
like a week

1257
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,040
um

1258
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,000
i'm at a four out of seven intensity on

1259
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
my program and i'm on p1 today just why

1260
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
not i was screwing around with it and i

1261
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
left it there

1262
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,520
right now

1263
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,839
i turned up my intensity now it's it

1264
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,520
went up a notch and i'm also going to

1265
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,599
change what the program is

1266
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,920
to two now the number two is blinking oh

1267
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,880
my god

1268
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,400
i changed my program while i'm standing

1269
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,760
here

1270
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
is that a communication channel keep in

1271
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,200
mind that she's communicating with your

1272
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,560
device

1273
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
we did actually stand next to each other

1274
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,920
with her rf meter and try to capture all

1275
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,040
the packages i have a little trouble

1276
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,960
capturing the channel is the question do

1277
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,680
you want it just curious

1278
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,280
when you turn your intensity up does

1279
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,960
that reduce your pain it's supposed to

1280
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,440
yes and actually um i haven't really

1281
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
needed it to and i probably wouldn't be

1282
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,520
here today and i only had this put in on

1283
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,319
june 21st so

1284
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
it's reduced my pain already from an

1285
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,640
eight to a four every day and i can like

1286
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,720
walk up hills and walk around whereas

1287
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,920
that would have really hurt me and i

1288
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,200
would have been in bed for the rest of

1289
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,720
the day

1290
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
even a month ago sure please

1291
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,400
so i just i just want to give some

1292
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
detail in case people are interested in

1293
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
how it works so it has two i don't know

1294
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,839
if you can tell from this picture

1295
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,280
actually it's not in the picture so you

1296
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,760
can't tell it has a couple of leads that

1297
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,640
go into a main nerve fiber and what this

1298
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
does is it obfuscates the signals that

1299
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,640
the body's sending because when you have

1300
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
chronic pain you're you're maladaptively

1301
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,200
sending like pain signals to a light

1302
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,599
touch or to an inappropriate stimuli

1303
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,000
um everything for everything and you're

1304
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,599
constantly it's like you're constantly

1305
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,680
on fire or constantly having pain so

1306
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,920
this thing interrupts the transmission

1307
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
of those signals up your spinal column

1308
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,760
by specifically uh sending a 10 000

1309
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
um kilohertz and i keep saying megahertz

1310
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,240
that's wrong that's a 30 meter handband

1311
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,800
so it's 10 000 kilohertz

1312
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,960
right and the interesting thing about

1313
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
that and i think her i'm not sure if

1314
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,319
your program one is this but the older

1315
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,240
programs are much lower frequency

1316
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,560
they're like 30 um

1317
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,640
hertz that's much lower it's closer to

1318
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
the biological frequency the natural

1319
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
frequency and with pa that works but the

1320
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
patients experience the tingling because

1321
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,839
that's a frequency that your body can

1322
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,359
recognize

1323
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,640
so the new

1324
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,960
program that she has it doesn't have

1325
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,560
that it's called paresthesia that

1326
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,480
tingling but it interrupts the

1327
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
transmission of those signals so back to

1328
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
pam that makes total sense to me because

1329
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,079
i can't feel it at all

1330
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,960
um even when i have played with it okay

1331
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
i'm a hacker i have turned it up to

1332
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,200
seven on both programs to see if i could

1333
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,839
feel it i cannot

1334
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
okay this is what it's called it's from

1335
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,319
the ancient greek i don't know how to

1336
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,079
pronounce that in ancient greek or any

1337
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,240
kind of greek but

1338
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,200
never

1339
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,880
really really awesome so it

1340
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,280
says the same sounds the same

1341
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,200
in english and greek

1342
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,599
oh hey regina look sends two signals we

1343
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,680
have two wires that are implanted in the

1344
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
dorsal horn of my spine

1345
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,280
did you not just say that oh but there

1346
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,040
is no login or password and it it um

1347
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
that crazy yeah you know so if you all

1348
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
want to come up here and try to hack it

1349
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,240
you can but there is no login or

1350
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,119
password um my doctor might have one if

1351
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,520
he wanted to make a new program

1352
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,079
i don't know but i will ask him when the

1353
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,040
next time

1354
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,280
he he uses the same this is a near field

1355
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,960
communication device i think we just

1356
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,720
said this right yeah and it's uh that

1357
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,119
they consider that secure because why

1358
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,079
would anyone else have this i don't know

1359
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,800
don't take it from me yeah and you just

1360
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,319
have to be near enough to the device to

1361
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,240
do an upload

1362
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,000
so don't hack me either bros

1363
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,200
i know

1364
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,520
okay i'm going home now no i could never

1365
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,359
do that anyway um awesome rules

1366
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,000
uh details thank you um so that's how it

1367
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,960
works

1368
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,280
yes there's this thing right below my

1369
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,040
waist it's a big lump right now because

1370
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,720
this hasn't really fully integrated into

1371
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,440
my body but it really has completely

1372
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,000
changed my life in under a month

1373
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,720
right oh wait wait two more days past a

1374
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,400
month sorry but um i just did the live

1375
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,319
device demo so

1376
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,960
questions toastman oh wait

1377
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,440
i promised i promised

1378
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,680
mr james he of the defibrillator that

1379
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,599
when we have q a in case anyone wanted

1380
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,920
to ask him a question i would call him

1381
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,359
so but questions for us

1382
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,520
any we do have a microphone over here so

1383
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
that our friends watching online can

1384
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,720
also hear your questions

1385
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,119
just a

1386
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:01,760
recommend it suggestion

1387
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,720
medical devices but um appliances like

1388
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,880
uh on the internet you can block it at

1389
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,119
the router level right yeah um and if

1390
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,200
it's like using rf

1391
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
they they sell those pouches where you

1392
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,880
put your cell phone in and then

1393
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,760
you mean like the refrigerator and put

1394
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,160
it in yeah

1395
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,559
yeah i i would try that i have an rf

1396
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,800
meter and that might that might work so

1397
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,160
that's that's a suggestion

1398
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,759
so you get exactly what they are um

1399
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,839
yeah yeah

1400
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,359
so i want to actually say something

1401
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,680
about that because people buy those rfid

1402
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,079
bags all the time to everybody

1403
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,200
and actually they as you go up in

1404
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
frequency they work less and less

1405
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,119
efficiently and this goes back to

1406
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,000
maxwell's laws for physics you know

1407
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,720
college physics but um you need the mesh

1408
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,559
to be tighter and tighter and you need

1409
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,319
the thickness of the metal to be

1410
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,960
increasing in order to block those high

1411
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
frequencies so they're not all as

1412
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,559
effective as you think who am i looking

1413
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,280
at you should be at the mic oh i'm so

1414
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,200
sorry can you guys hear me

1415
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,359
not really oh gosh you should have

1416
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,920
screamed at me i'm sorry

1417
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,880
rfid bags oh that is much louder they

1418
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,800
don't work as efficiently as you go up

1419
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,200
in frequency so with 5g phones if you're

1420
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,640
putting in that little pouch they're

1421
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,240
still tracking you by the way as a

1422
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,160
commercial message your friend jim who

1423
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,680
this talk was partially about is now

1424
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,900
attending via video okay

1425
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:56,820
[Applause]

1426
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,720
did you have a question or i'm sorry

1427
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,319
i feel like we do need so you've talked

1428
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,960
a lot about some very interesting

1429
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,440
vulnerabilities that these devices have

1430
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
uh in terms of bigger pictures what's

1431
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,839
going on there

1432
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,079
is does it just seem like no movement

1433
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,200
ever

1434
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,920
what do you see next um so that's an

1435
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,000
interesting question i

1436
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,640
i have a little uh trouble looking ahead

1437
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,960
because what i don't see wait that thing

1438
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,520
is talking why is that talking i'll tell

1439
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,839
you why in a minute okay what i what i

1440
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,559
really don't see is without people

1441
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,400
having knowledge of this and being upset

1442
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,880
about it and demanding privacy i don't

1443
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,839
see this going backwards um it's very

1444
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,680
easy rf communications are invisible

1445
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,599
unless everybody walks around with our

1446
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,440
rf detector and then still what are they

1447
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,880
going to do i have a detector all the

1448
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,200
time and i go there's a big signal here

1449
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,040
you know i can't go and hide myself in a

1450
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,119
little faraday cage so i think

1451
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,440
what i would love to see is if i raise

1452
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,920
enough consciousness that people object

1453
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,079
and then the manufacturers have to go

1454
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,680
backwards in this

1455
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,480
if is that a question or a hello

1456
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,839
hello

1457
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,760
ah ah okay good all right thank you and

1458
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,480
i am sorry regina but the reason

1459
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,240
we're on time delay jim is on time

1460
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
delays i'm hearing yourself speaking

1461
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,880
through oh wow that is confusing

1462
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
right

1463
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,280
any other questions or

1464
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,319
hello oh hi hi so uh just a random

1465
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,400
question if you do lose oh there we go

1466
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,040
uh say you lost your remote or it breaks

1467
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
what's the process like to get a new one

1468
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,880
do they have to switch out your device

1469
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,640
and you're back or there's just like a

1470
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,400
keep like repairing with a different

1471
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,680
device

1472
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,040
totally i'm sure i'd have to go to the

1473
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,440
doctor's office but they could give me a

1474
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,839
new one and then re-key it to my device

1475
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,640
i've

1476
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,079
they actually told me that when they

1477
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,520
gave it to me but

1478
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,960
and i had a different remote for the

1479
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,480
seven-day trial one two and i didn't

1480
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,480
lose that one either but
