1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
all right hello everyone welcome back to

2
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,239
our last day of hope how's the

3
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,479
conference going

4
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
everyone tired now or ready for more

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,920
thank you for volunteering oh you're

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,119
welcome

7
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,759
all right so we have another great talk

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
here called castaway a do-it-yourself

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
platform for video capture automation

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
and various antics from our presenter

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
adam tanner so with that

12
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
i will pass to you adam

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,299
[Applause]

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
all right uh

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
i every every project needs a clever

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
title so i've called this one cast away

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
uh partly because nobody has a vcr

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
anymore

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
and

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
i also have this strange hobby of

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,560
collecting vhs tapes

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
but

23
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
all right so

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
i'm adam engineer

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
mostly programming in java and python um

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,959
although kind of a little bit of

27
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,920
everything

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
the last time i gave a talk at hope

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,920
was about the lisp programming language

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
and another one of the problems was the

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,879
longer you research the better sources

32
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,400
you find and

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
the scope of your project just keeps

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
increasing

35
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
so um

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
personally i'm involved with some

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,959
robotics and computer vision

38
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,920
which is

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
interesting but again there's a lot to

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
go through

41
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
and i'm also a member of fubar labs in

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
now north brunswick new jersey so

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
find and support your local hackerspaces

44
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
as as we

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
heard from the last talk time is a

46
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
finite resource

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800
is the necessary but not sufficient

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
ingredient in basically everything

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,319
uh

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
so

51
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
i feel like i should have maybe started

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
this

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
this earlier

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
when when i knew that there were a lot

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
more vhs tapes out there or maybe should

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
have never started at all but

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
the funny thing is that there's a lot of

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,319
weird things getting captured by vhs

59
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
like i found someone who decided to

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
record the

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,360
the special edition of star wars

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
uh

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
which was on uh i think the wb-11

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
and unfortunately that happened to be

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
the same day that the uh

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,120
the columbia disaster occurred so

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
and enjoy your uh escapism

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
yeah

69
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,159
but

70
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
um the other part of it was uh

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
you know if if you're looking for

72
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,760
something interesting to use as a

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
as a data source

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
there's not too much you know more more

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
copious than uh than live tv

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
so there's there's a few advantages to

77
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,040
that too

78
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
but you know you can't go faster than

79
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,360
real time

80
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
but

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
so if uh

82
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
if there's anything that you want to

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
watch it's probably out there if you

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
want

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
you know if you want to watch alex

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
trebek host classic concentration

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
there is a channel for that

88
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
if you would like to

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
absolutely obliterate five hours of your

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,680
day

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
six days a week there is a channel that

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,639
has

93
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
star trek

94
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,719
from about 8 pm onward

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
if you want to discover a show that has

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
two former star trek actors

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
i think uh benson had uh

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
rene aberjeonois which i've been making

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,199
sure i'd pronounced properly for most of

100
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
the last week um and robert picardo

101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
so there's there's all sorts of weird

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
guest shows you know guest appearances

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
and things like that

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,919
lots of late night stand up that did not

105
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
age very well

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,840
but

107
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
i found a tape that someone had labeled

108
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
trip to london

109
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
it was not their trip to london it was

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
good morning america when they couldn't

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
watch it so that was a little

112
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,479
disappointing

113
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,400
but

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
um

115
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
so this is this is sort of an

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,479
interesting uh revelation that i had

117
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,919
although i could have just probably gone

118
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,160
to film school or acting school or

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
something uh but humans like narrative

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
they like things to have a start a

121
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
middle and end a resolution

122
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,039
things are supposed to make sense this

123
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360
is why i mean unsolved mysteries was a

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,880
cool show but

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
kind of madness inducing

126
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
um you know we we tell ourselves stories

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
about you know who we are

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
who other people are you know the the

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
rise and fall of civilizations

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
of course the

131
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
the downside to having a new theory is

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
you try and jam everything else into it

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
but

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,919
it's uh

135
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,680
it's not a bad thing usually we have um

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,199
you know stories we tell ourselves

137
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
sometimes that are not true but

138
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,479
it helps for us to make predictions and

139
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
sense of things

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
uh

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
i could argue that uh lots of improved

142
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
display technologies are also in service

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
of

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
having a narrative higher fidelity more

145
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,759
believability

146
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
you know

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
this is where i wonder why i didn't

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
bring water with me it's because i

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
finished it already

150
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
but

151
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,599
um

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,199
anyway this is why we like good special

153
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
effects because it will convince us of

154
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,560
something that is true

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
ascii and you shall receive ski

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,960
well you'll receive a silly ansi

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
i think it's the other reason why people

158
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
don't like spoilers they want to be

159
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,680
transported away they don't want things

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
ruined

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
uh

162
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
although i feel like you know if you go

163
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
on vacation you kind of want to know

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
what's there already

165
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
but

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,639
humans don't like to be bored

167
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,360
they

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
you know will invent stuff

169
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,720
not to have to think about

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
things

171
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,879
but

172
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,520
so uh you know the question is well if

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
there's all this television to watch can

174
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
we perhaps get the computer to watch it

175
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,319
for us so the the original idea was

176
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,319
um

177
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
uh you know the tv shows themselves were

178
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,240
not that interesting but the random

179
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
commercials that people

180
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,560
found

181
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
uh and you know i have tapes that i made

182
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,319
as a kid that i

183
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
you know dutifully got rid of the

184
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,599
commercials which

185
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
kind of the most important part now so

186
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,080
you can get a show anywhere

187
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
but you may not have the serendipity of

188
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
uh finding the right commercials so

189
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
uh

190
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,320
it's also sort of interesting to think

191
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
about the the expansion of television

192
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
and radio um

193
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,958
you know the the

194
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
the show prairie home companion which we

195
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
do not talk about anymore

196
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
uh

197
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
you know just just imagine you are alone

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
on the plains and this is your companion

199
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
enjoy not being lonely for a little

200
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
while

201
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
but

202
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
um

203
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,279
you know especially something like star

204
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
trek they they put in this the idea for

205
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
the sets and all the music and you know

206
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
if you want to fall asleep maybe you'll

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
run a uh

208
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
several hour loop of engine sounds you

209
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,959
know you

210
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,319
get to not be where you are

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
so here's here's a few

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
benefits of

213
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,839
you know

214
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
television versus reality

215
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
also on tv no pandemic for the moment

216
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
but

217
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
the other good things about using it as

218
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
a data source is

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
you know there's there's been thought

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,880
put into basically every aspect of it uh

221
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
you hope that they wrote the story as

222
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
well but

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,000
um

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
things are predictable you know the the

225
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,360
procedural proceeds

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
the mystery is solved within your your

227
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
30 or 50 minute time frame

228
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
and there's space for commercials in the

229
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,480
middle

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
one of the things that i thought about

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
well it would be funny you know

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
to have

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
kids books with advertisements in them

234
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
but then i realized that there's youtube

235
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
so

236
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
there's also um

237
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
you know before you go to sleep what do

238
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
you say you know oh you know mommy tell

239
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
me a story daddy tell me a story

240
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
or you know when you come home what do

241
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,320
they ask what did you learn in school

242
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
today nothing

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
you you want to have some sort of

244
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
narrative

245
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,360
to

246
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
fill in the gaps of what's going on

247
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
you know word from distant lands even if

248
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
distant lands is the school

249
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
so

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
the the

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
downside of course of using television

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
and

253
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
who knows if space aliens are judging us

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,959
by our

255
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,440
our emitted transmissions

256
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,399
um

257
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,120
but it's not the real world

258
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,040
it's very clean it's very pretty it's

259
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
very colorful

260
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
it is literally fiction in most cases so

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
any sort of

262
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
cultural insights you might draw from

263
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
local or foreign television

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
you know they they produce their works

265
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
as well so everyone is sort of learning

266
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
television as a as a communication

267
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,959
medium

268
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
so i i wanted to have a few more legal

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,600
cases but the the big one here is uh

270
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
known as the betamax case

271
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
funny enough betamax the format didn't

272
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
survive outside of uh

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
professional recording studios

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
but

275
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
this was a case brought by universal

276
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
studios supreme court decided in favor

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
of sony

278
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,519
making full copies of television is

279
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,760
deemed fair use for the purposes of time

280
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
shifting i don't know what other

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
purposes you would have for recording

282
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
television

283
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,519
uh either in full or in part

284
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
but

285
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,959
this fair use

286
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
sort of carve out

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,720
or codification

288
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
enabled lots of further technologies

289
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
there was also something about the the

290
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
burn convention which i thought was

291
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,399
something from the 80s it is from the

292
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
80s but the 1880s

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
and that concerns things like

294
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
making excerpts derivative works things

295
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,959
like that

296
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
but not a lawyer so

297
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,040
so

298
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,560
minor physical demo time

299
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,599
nothing's getting plugged in though

300
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,760
all right you know what that's good

301
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
enough everyone knows what a raspberry

302
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
pi looks like

303
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
i guess for the benefits of the viewers

304
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
at home

305
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
um it's just this kind of crappy flat

306
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
panel antenna but we're in new york city

307
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,920
give or take

308
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,479
so it works

309
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,519
this is a

310
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,920
dvr that you can purchase

311
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
this is sort of an outgrowth of the

312
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
cable set top boxes

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
not cable but broadcast for the digital

314
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
television transition

315
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
um

316
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,439
well i have more on this later but

317
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,839
right so uh the way that this is sort of

318
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,519
structured um

319
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,639
and i thought it would be a bigger

320
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,600
problem because i thought it would have

321
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,639
more code written but

322
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,760
not that much code got finished

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
and so sorting out the licenses won't be

324
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
that big of a problem but um this is

325
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
mostly just for monitoring and as a

326
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
sort of

327
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,399
i guess

328
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,279
side process of uh

329
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,959
of actually recording

330
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
and once you have the files you can use

331
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
a lot of the same opencv

332
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
pipelines to do analysis and it doesn't

333
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,040
have to be real time and you can put it

334
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
on more powerful hardware

335
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
of course without the processing you can

336
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,160
do live streaming

337
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
and it's not a big problem

338
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,000
but so

339
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,800
this is sort of the the star of the show

340
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
it's a little bit disorienting to be

341
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
able to see myself but

342
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,800
this is just a usb 2 hdmi capture

343
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
device and

344
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,480
you know i thought how is this possible

345
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
uh it is it is not a scam but you have

346
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,839
to

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,199
one make sure you're plugging in the

348
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,519
right thing it's got usb on one side and

349
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,279
hdmi on the other

350
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,600
i have plugged things into itself not

351
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,839
helpful

352
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,519
but

353
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
i have the options in the next next

354
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,759
slide

355
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
and the

356
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
important thing about the

357
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,360
using the

358
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
converter box is i needed something with

359
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,399
a tuner

360
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,320
and an hdmi output

361
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
so my tv

362
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
will not output hdmi it's not that fancy

363
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,560
i don't have a receiver or anything like

364
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
that so

365
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,720
uh this is about 15 bucks there are

366
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
analog versions for

367
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
analog sources

368
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
um

369
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
usually called an easy cap

370
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
also about 15 bucks

371
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
i'm not that old i hope but i remember

372
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
where you could easily pay 300 for

373
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,079
something like that just to get video

374
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,880
into your computer

375
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,639
uh so here's the important settings for

376
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
vlc uh

377
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
you you choose your your source

378
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
you have your

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
resolution

380
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,320
set your

381
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
caching to zero

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
and then the very important thing

383
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
is choosing mjpeg the motion jpeg

384
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,639
encoding will give you you know 30

385
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,160
frames per second

386
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
and this is important because

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
one of the other applications

388
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
for this is as the

389
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
sort of world's smallest kvm

390
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,600
so

391
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,799
you get this

392
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,640
you plug it into your computer you plug

393
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,319
into your other device with hdmi out

394
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,039
well you get yourself a media keyboard

395
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
imagine it here

396
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
and then you

397
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,640
try not to forget which keyboard you're

398
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
typing on but once you get the network

399
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
set up

400
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
you can forget about it you can ssh you

401
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,039
can do everything else

402
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,320
and it's a lot smaller than carrying

403
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,039
another monitor around

404
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,160
but

405
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
this this has saved me a few times

406
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,039
uh although

407
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
i spent a good six hours working on this

408
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
yesterday and

409
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
discovered that the the local hope

410
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
network would not allow me to connect

411
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
from device to device

412
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,520
probably for the best

413
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
one hot spot

414
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
would also not let me do that my second

415
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
hot spot

416
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,280
why should i have two hot spots but that

417
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,120
worked so i was i was

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
connecting over the network

419
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
you know

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
to this local device because nothing

421
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,440
else worked but

422
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
um

423
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
so

424
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
uh one of the things that uh was useful

425
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
to me before i actually was able to find

426
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
a raspberry pi 4. um

427
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
the most important thing about these two

428
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
boards is that they're in stock you can

429
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
buy them and have them you know

430
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
soon

431
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,280
definitely buy heatsink though

432
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
this one on the right

433
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
which right this right has a raspberry

434
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
pi cable uh camera connector in case

435
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,720
that is useful to you in projects

436
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
the one on the left i think is

437
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,320
substantially faster

438
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,520
but i'm also not sure what is taking up

439
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
the most processing time

440
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
it is

441
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
yeah definitely get a heat sink

442
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
get a case with a fan if possible as

443
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
well as this will

444
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
this will max out available cpu

445
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
but

446
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,520
the cool thing with this is they have

447
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,760
infrared receivers so when you are

448
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,640
when you are learning the device codes

449
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
uh it's just right there um

450
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
there was a i think i had to have it on

451
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
another slide

452
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
yep okay so they have the infrared

453
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
detector built in

454
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
this took me a little bit too long to

455
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
figure out

456
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,600
but they moved it from the previous lirc

457
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
into the kernel itself so

458
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
you have to set something in the config

459
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
you choose what pins you have either on

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,720
the pcb or as an output

461
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
as well

462
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,919
and you have very easy

463
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
access to infrared and from there you

464
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,520
can use it as a remote control to

465
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,678
interface with your other devices

466
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
so

467
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,640
this is where we have a little bit more

468
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
story

469
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,960
um

470
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
so for a very long time

471
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,360
uh

472
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,760
i had been telling people to plug their

473
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
cable into their television

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
and even if they didn't have a cable tv

475
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
subscription

476
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
my understanding was that the cable

477
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,080
companies were supposed to provide

478
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
over-the-air channels for free as maybe

479
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
this uh

480
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000
high high moral notion of public safety

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
that the the broadcast airwaves that

482
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
belong to the people should be carried

483
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,080
at you know

484
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,799
just as a courtesy uh

485
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,880
but uh

486
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
they they decided in this area and

487
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,799
probably everywhere else to encrypt them

488
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,919
so

489
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,720
uh you get to rent a cable box

490
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
for another five dollars a month or

491
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,559
whatever for your broadcast basic plan

492
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
hooray

493
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
uh maybe maybe we should be taxing some

494
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
of those rights of way that the cable

495
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,720
companies are enjoying but anyway so

496
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
this was a little bit annoying

497
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,280
uh

498
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
one of the things my

499
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,360
television would tune all of the cable

500
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
channels in about eight minutes uh and

501
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
then would take another 40 minutes to

502
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
get rid of all these scrambled ones

503
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
which was not ideal but you didn't have

504
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
to do it very much

505
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
very often so once

506
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
everything went away except for home

507
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
shopping network and all the placeholder

508
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
channels

509
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
i decided why not let's uh let's go old

510
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
school and get an antenna

511
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,400
and i learned a little bit too much

512
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
about antennas

513
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,159
but

514
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,919
where i live is somewhere between new

515
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,840
york and philly and i was thinking well

516
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,200
if i have you know a 60 80 mile range

517
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
antenna which

518
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
you know theoretically works but uh

519
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
curvature of the earth and all that

520
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
doesn't so

521
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
i decided why not i'll get this antenna

522
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,559
if i can point it at philadelphia which

523
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,200
is more distant maybe i can get

524
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,559
you know the the stronger new york

525
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,320
signals out of the

526
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
the the back reception lobe of the

527
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,320
antenna

528
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
the antenna itself is i believe a

529
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,159
combination

530
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,760
yagi-uda and

531
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
log periodic and whatever the

532
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
interaction of those things

533
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
didn't make it that possible but

534
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,760
i also learned that abc6 has decided

535
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
that they want to stay on their original

536
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
frequency

537
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,840
uh

538
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,200
the call letters are w p

539
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
v i

540
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,120
don't get that in the wrong order

541
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
and vi meaning roman numeral six so they

542
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,799
are in fact on the old uh

543
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,280
low frequency

544
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200
i think it's a high vhf or it might be a

545
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
low vhf

546
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
and so you need a very large antenna

547
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,960
which is probably why it's better to

548
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
have it carried on

549
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,799
cables but

550
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
anyway so

551
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
i have this

552
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,039
new crazy idea to make a

553
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,400
an antenna but where am i going to put

554
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,919
it i'm going to put it in the attic

555
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,039
because i don't want to go outside ever

556
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,279
especially if there's risk of contact

557
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,440
with the ground at high velocity

558
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
so

559
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,320
bought some mdf this is at

560
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,200
my hackerspace a former location though

561
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,720
and that's another

562
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
different long weird story but

563
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,320
got a homer bucket

564
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
got some mdf did some measurements

565
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
some time on the band saw

566
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
drilled the holes i feel like a genius

567
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
for putting the

568
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
the second hole to lift it because

569
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,279
otherwise this would have been much more

570
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,320
difficult

571
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
and some bags of sand so this entire

572
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,799
thing is portable

573
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
other people have been doing

574
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
similar things

575
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
but usually they use concrete which is

576
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
not great if you're renting

577
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,919
but

578
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,320
here's the antenna here's a wonderful

579
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,799
pandemic haircut that i acquired over

580
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,080
time

581
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,159
and here is the antenna in the attic

582
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,679
where no one has to think about it

583
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,600
but

584
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
um yeah so that's sort of the the

585
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,440
physical hardware part

586
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
um

587
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,279
so

588
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,200
uh

589
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
let's see some of the the sort of

590
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,279
theoretical underpinnings of this

591
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,720
project which

592
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,640
i guess you need some you need some

593
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
theory in order to know which direction

594
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
you should go but uh there was in in my

595
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,880
early days of the internet i came across

596
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
a sort of media experiment called the

597
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,159
the zen tv experiment and you were

598
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,600
supposed to

599
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
watch

600
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,799
15 or so minutes of any tv program with

601
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,320
the sound off so you do not have the

602
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,400
the added

603
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
sort of stimulation but also

604
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
sort of convincing you of the reality of

605
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,039
the of the show and you're supposed to

606
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,760
keep track of every technical event so

607
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,000
if somebody zooms if they cut to the

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
next scene

609
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
uh if there's a fade a wipe

610
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
things like that you're supposed to take

611
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,240
note of it and sort of

612
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
i guess be aware

613
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,919
of the mechanics of storytelling

614
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
so this is uh again maybe would have

615
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
been gone over in a first uh intro media

616
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,799
studies or acting class or writing class

617
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,880
but uh

618
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
did not do that so

619
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
the next part is you're supposed to

620
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,279
watch i think a news program and uh

621
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,760
again be conscious of what they are

622
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
are showing you

623
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
uh and how things are presented and then

624
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,039
the part that gets people angry is

625
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,000
you're supposed to turn off the

626
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,159
television and watch a turned off

627
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,559
television for 30 minutes and how does

628
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,720
that make you feel

629
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,880
i mean you could i hope that won't send

630
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
anybody to therapy but

631
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,960
uh it is good to be aware of your

632
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
feelings and not just as something that

633
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,840
happens to you but something that uh

634
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,039
you can

635
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,440
sort of notice and

636
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
react to

637
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
the

638
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,880
well i had a thought just a moment ago

639
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,960
but um

640
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,559
anyway

641
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,559
um

642
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,679
step away from the mic to breathe

643
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,600
but

644
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,918
um

645
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,520
so you know once once we have sort of a

646
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
an understanding of the structure of you

647
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
know the the shows that they're trying

648
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,159
to you know have things presented to us

649
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
uh the question is can we do any sort of

650
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
analysis on this uh and sort of have a

651
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
uh

652
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,240
have sort of a a framework or pattern

653
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
for how these things are structured you

654
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
know how can we maybe tell better

655
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,520
stories or

656
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
discover little tricks that people used

657
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,399
and the the original thing was to do

658
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,480
something like commercial detection

659
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,440
because

660
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,039
if you have a full long video file

661
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,880
that's just a dump from

662
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,039
a vhs from unknown time

663
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
uh maybe you want to just see the

664
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
commercials so

665
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,159
a long time ago i saw a

666
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
project that had gotten featured at some

667
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,039
film festival

668
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
i think it was in brooklyn

669
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
i didn't i thought it was another more

670
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,679
famous one but uh they took movies and

671
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,520
they made barcodes out of them

672
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,320
uh

673
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,679
and the first one i saw was kind of

674
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
uninspiring but other people actually

675
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
went and did the processing

676
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,799
i want to do one that's a little bit

677
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,880
structured a little bit differently i'd

678
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,799
like to actually sort the pixels in some

679
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,960
way they just took a screen cap and

680
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
squished it

681
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,559
but

682
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,120
once you have this you can make things

683
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,320
like histograms um and

684
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
you know eventually use that as a as a

685
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,240
data source and have some sort of

686
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
if not a neural network some other kind

687
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,279
of

688
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,279
lower computational power machine

689
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,360
learning to categorize what it is you

690
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,279
are watching

691
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,480
i don't

692
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,039
care that much about sports but i

693
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,320
appreciate that they're interesting

694
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,679
because you don't necessarily know what

695
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,080
the outcome is

696
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,279
so

697
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,200
good for sports fans

698
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,080
uh

699
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,159
although i will i will buy a vicarious

700
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,880
winner shirt if anyone produces one

701
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,919
um

702
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
anyway so

703
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
as another side effect of

704
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,120
having this data source um you can do

705
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
things like background analysis see if

706
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
there's any sort of

707
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,480
motion going on

708
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,080
one of the

709
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
demo filters that

710
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,640
i got from the

711
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,120
um

712
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
the original flask video streaming uh it

713
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
just averages a bunch of frames compares

714
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,919
with it compares it with the current one

715
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,840
does a little bit of processing on what

716
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,799
has changed and draws a bounding box

717
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,559
around it

718
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,039
animation especially you can tell

719
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,440
nothing changes in the background

720
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,320
and once it's pointed out you sort of

721
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
again become aware of what they want you

722
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
to focus on

723
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,919
uh

724
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
i mean a lot of times for cartoons it's

725
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
a character's mouth

726
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,159
or

727
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,760
you know something else that's moving

728
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,720
and

729
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,279
you know animation is a an artificial

730
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
medium but

731
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,399
you sort of

732
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,559
you know break it down from from how it

733
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,320
was created and how that affects the

734
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
finished product

735
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
something i realized a long time ago one

736
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
of the

737
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,559
side effects of animation production is

738
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,440
that it's done in very small batches and

739
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,159
so the scenes are always changing and so

740
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,760
it's sort of

741
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
at the very least entertaining to watch

742
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,320
because uh there's always something new

743
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,000
but that again is a side effect of how

744
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
it is made

745
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
so

746
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,439
let's see what the next slide is

747
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,000
right so

748
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,080
mostly this is this is using

749
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
opencv

750
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,279
open computer vision

751
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,159
which was started a very long time ago

752
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,159
and a convenience package for imutils

753
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,720
this is run by created and open sourced

754
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,519
by

755
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
adrian rosebrock

756
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
and

757
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,039
again this is a bunch of convenience

758
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,600
features and one of the

759
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,039
good thing is you only need to change

760
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,519
one line of code to go from

761
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,679
a capture from a file to get frames out

762
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,720
of it to live video

763
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
um

764
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,799
yeah but again there's lots of example

765
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,320
code out there

766
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
there's

767
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
lots of

768
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
directions that this could go

769
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,159
if you want you know motion detection

770
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,240
that exists but what if you want the

771
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,320
opposite you want the things that stay

772
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,559
the same in case again

773
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,080
maybe you want to

774
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,960
get good still frames of some sitcoms

775
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
apartment

776
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,799
and then you can take that as data and

777
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,880
put it somewhere else

778
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,240
for reconstruction or photogrammetry

779
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,679
or again if you want to steal someone's

780
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,840
zoom background

781
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,279
um uh

782
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
yes

783
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,399
so

784
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,080
things do not go always in order

785
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
uh

786
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,760
i guess one one one other side effect of

787
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,080
perhaps being exposed to too many

788
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,039
special effects reports and uh that

789
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,880
itself is sort of a narrative it's like

790
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,039
this is how they did this

791
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,000
and

792
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,600
you know you you get lost in the

793
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,559
method of creating it i don't know if if

794
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,799
storytellers of ancient time

795
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,840
gave little uh master classes

796
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
on on how they tell stories but

797
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,880
uh you know you you have the

798
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,159
special effects report and you're like

799
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,600
yeah that's cool

800
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
and then when you watch it you're like

801
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,279
wow that's cool i know how they did that

802
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,960
and you might be

803
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
uh completely oblivious to the emotional

804
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
tone that they're trying to convey or

805
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,519
you know

806
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,679
great they use this lens but

807
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
you know what does the sun rising over

808
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,880
this mountain supposed to make you feel

809
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,440
humans aside from liking narrative

810
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,720
they have lots of feelings

811
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,399
and

812
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,519
storytelling is another you know

813
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,559
sort of

814
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,720
artifact of uh

815
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
of the way humans are

816
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
but

817
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
so

818
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
uh

819
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
one of the fun things

820
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,799
of finding old videotapes uh

821
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,519
these two tv stations do not exist um

822
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,440
also slightly uncomfortable by the twin

823
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,200
towers here but at least it's not wpix11

824
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,679
um but

825
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,760
uh it's funny here with wnew 5 which

826
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
they're they're touting their 40 years

827
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,679
of fine tuning

828
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,559
this i think was from 1983

829
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,440
and

830
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,879
i think maybe 1985 or 86 it became wnyw

831
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,159
which is now a fox 5 station

832
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,560
wnyc i believe is

833
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
was part of the

834
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,879
the same group that had the uh

835
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,199
the radio station and that you know came

836
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,199
together and came apart

837
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,800
uh and so this is

838
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,320
a relic from the past definitely but

839
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,679
um

840
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,000
the the one on the left here somebody

841
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
had hbo in the early 80s and they put a

842
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,599
tape in

843
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,320
and they hit record for three or four

844
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,280
hours

845
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,159
um

846
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,599
which was

847
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,520
sort of amazing i actually was able to

848
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,639
find out what day it was recorded

849
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,918
but

850
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,000
just totally wild stuff

851
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,918
uh three movies

852
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,239
uh the first of which i had to

853
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,000
search for because they had missed the

854
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,599
intro

855
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,119
but

856
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
um other things like nightline if you

857
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,440
wait around they will tell you what day

858
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,560
it is

859
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,440
uh

860
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
but

861
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
the other interesting thing is that

862
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,280
we still have car ads they had car ads

863
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
the cars earlier you know they could

864
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
advertise for four thousand dollars

865
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
which is sort of amazing but that's

866
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,200
inflation for you also

867
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,920
possibly no airbags

868
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
um

869
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,440
other fun stuff and i wish i could find

870
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
the tape that i got this from but

871
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,560
this was this was x-files it was a rerun

872
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
it was brought to you by the movie that

873
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,240
was coming out soon strange days

874
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,119
and they even had a short promo to join

875
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,440
their discussion on delphi

876
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,200
so this was this was before 1994 when uh

877
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,359
commercial usage of the internet was

878
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,599
uh explicitly allowed

879
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,720
and also

880
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
yes i know this is hilarious that this

881
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,720
is these are literal screenshots

882
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,359
uh

883
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,280
but you know

884
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,359
some some people

885
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,280
get sent screenshots of like can you

886
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,839
believe that this is what i found uh but

887
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,560
there was an ad for next step

888
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,640
which was uh you know which is which is

889
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
prevalent in the new operating systems

890
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,640
uh now but was um

891
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
i'm just i'm i'm very curious why they

892
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
had an ad for it

893
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,720
uh

894
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,520
yeah then again on uh jason scott's talk

895
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,160
he he mentioned some tapes that he had

896
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,720
found from someone where they were

897
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,760
uh

898
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,720
talking about this hot new os from a t

899
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,040
that was going to change everything

900
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,440
uh i guess it depends on your

901
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,880
on your audience but

902
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,560
um

903
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,799
so

904
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,240
one of the things that i wanted to do

905
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
and of course there is still time but

906
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,920
using the movie barcode type of

907
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
analysis

908
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,320
um

909
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,599
and the great thing is once you've

910
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,440
recorded something

911
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,160
you can just go back and take the the

912
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,359
file

913
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,839
and opencv has a lot of

914
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,280
uh

915
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
i guess decoders but that's a solved

916
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
problem you can convert from one thing

917
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
to another but taking two episodes of

918
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,119
the same procedural and uh seeing how

919
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,119
they line up seeing how they have

920
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
arranged the beats

921
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,480
um

922
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,520
you know

923
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
and and sometimes the law and order

924
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,359
sound effect but um

925
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,800
you know

926
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
everything is the same except for where

927
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,400
it's different

928
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,040
and i was also watching a kung fu movie

929
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,240
that

930
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
someone had on on tv and i was sort of

931
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,640
wondering how much of this movie do they

932
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
actually spend fighting

933
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,760
which you could do with a pose analysis

934
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
pose estimation library

935
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,320
and then you can have that as

936
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
output

937
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
in some

938
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,119
sensible way to to make it make sense

939
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,000
but um

940
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,880
i don't know if you've ever watched a

941
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,640
movie on amazon prime but they have

942
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
their little x-ray and they will tell

943
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,480
you about the actors that happen to be

944
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,000
in that scene

945
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
um

946
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,400
what i had wanted to have

947
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
prepared was a

948
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
an analysis of

949
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
a star trek episode it happened to be

950
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,480
best of both worlds part two so

951
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,880
a card would not be in it as much

952
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,800
but riker would so if you were a riker

953
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,400
liker you could get

954
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
some kind of percentage of appearance in

955
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,119
in various episodes

956
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,960
but

957
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,960
um

958
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,480
yeah so uh as as a data source

959
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,119
live tv is sort of

960
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,440
infinitely uh infinitely mineable

961
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,119
wasteland

962
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,160
but

963
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
you know in case you have time to

964
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,480
destroy

965
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
uh

966
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,359
it's certainly always there

967
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,880
but um

968
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,920
so

969
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,839
a lot of the ideas that i had

970
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,520
with this uh

971
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,480
were sort of helped and supported by

972
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,359
um

973
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,240
uh

974
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,040
one of the groups that we have uh

975
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
we're sort of in transition between

976
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,440
meetup and discord and jitsi and

977
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,760
uh best thing is to just go on our

978
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,960
website

979
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,680
find out what we're hosting now um and

980
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,279
what the different topics are

981
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,960
yeah one of one of the previous talks

982
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,560
was using uh

983
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,800
neural networks to figure out uh you

984
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,240
know generative mcesher drawings

985
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,079
so

986
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,079
some people are using it for family

987
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,160
photos and seeing if they can identify

988
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
people and if it's the same person ask

989
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,839
questions who is this how are they

990
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,440
related to us things like that

991
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
but

992
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,520
it's always good to have notes right

993
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,280
one of the other things that i had

994
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
wanted to do with a vcr but the dvr does

995
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
not have an analog tuner in it

996
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,359
was some way to automate recording the

997
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,240
video off of the vhs cassette rewinding

998
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,280
it and then

999
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,359
having the captions hard matted and

1000
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,440
automatically detecting uh what

1001
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,520
the captions are so you don't have to go

1002
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
through do it manually or lose it

1003
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,760
forever

1004
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,599
it's also another fun one if you watch

1005
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,200
the show from a certain time sometimes

1006
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,640
the captions are sponsored and they'll

1007
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,079
put the sponsoring company's uh

1008
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,079
you know tagline at the time

1009
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,640
which is completely foreign to us now

1010
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,640
but

1011
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,160
anyway

1012
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
yep and i guess

1013
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,839
if if anybody has a cool project

1014
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,720
uh

1015
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
send send me an email

1016
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,000
i'm

1017
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,240
reworking the website because of course

1018
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,560
everything is always in progress

1019
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,119
and i'm going to put some of my other

1020
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,119
hardware and software projects up there

1021
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,359
so uh

1022
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,160
any questions

1023
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,079
and i guess a a good a good question is

1024
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,720
why but uh you know we do have a

1025
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
question over the matrix chat okay

1026
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
excellent clarification actually yes uh

1027
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,480
someone was curious if you could clarify

1028
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
which hdmi to usb capture device you

1029
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,040
were using what are some examples the

1030
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,560
model or the version or the equipment

1031
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,720
uh unfortunately i mean there are a lot

1032
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,839
of them which is great

1033
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,200
i mean it it you know

1034
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,560
can't can't zoom in on it but it

1035
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,480
basically just says hdmi video capture

1036
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
it is not a usbc

1037
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,119
2 hdmi out

1038
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,160
it is

1039
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,319
and it'll it'll take up to 4k

1040
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,119
um

1041
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
it will only output 1080p

1042
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,440
but

1043
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,520
this one also useful because when

1044
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,480
there's no signal you get color bars

1045
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,440
previous one was just blank which is not

1046
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
great when you discover that it has

1047
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,040
actually died and you're not getting any

1048
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
video at all

1049
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,680
ever

1050
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,760
but um

1051
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
yeah again i i support the uh

1052
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,760
the tiniest kvm use case for this as

1053
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
well um but

1054
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,640
an unfortunate amount of time yesterday

1055
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,280
was spent getting the infrared output

1056
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
working but i successfully got it to

1057
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,720
turn off so i'm kind of happy

1058
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,160
but again

1059
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,599
all the documentation for that sort of

1060
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,680
thing is online

1061
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
i was not able to construct one and have

1062
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,000
a one two three times an led joke

1063
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,160
but

1064
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,839
yeah so it's uh

1065
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,599
i think it's an interesting project

1066
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,400
there's always something new

1067
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,280
being broadcast

1068
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
and and untold

1069
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,040
things to discover

1070
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,079
uh

1071
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,319
in people's discarded vhs tapes were

1072
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,520
donated

1073
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,480
or

1074
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,319
purchased at a yard sale

1075
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,079
but anyway

1076
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,160
uh thank you for coming is there a

1077
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,960
repository somewhere where all this

1078
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
there there will be um there is not as

1079
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,359
much code

1080
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,240
as uh as i thought uh the starting point

1081
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,000
was a flask

1082
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
uh live video streaming

1083
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
um and again there are other

1084
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,839
uh no processing streaming solutions out

1085
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,960
there uh so the the real point of this

1086
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,280
and it takes every frame it does the

1087
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,599
processing and then it re-encodes it as

1088
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,359
a multi-part jpeg

1089
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,280
and just sends it along which is also

1090
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
why it will consume any cpu power that

1091
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,000
you have available

1092
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,119
although having multiple people view it

1093
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,040
doesn't make it get worse so that's

1094
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,960
that's an upside at least

1095
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,480
all right any other questions

1096
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,640
next well thank you adam for the
