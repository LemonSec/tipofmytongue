00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,140
all right everyone welcome to the next

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,900
talk yeah in our track three I just

5
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,759
couple lines of business before we go

6
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,979
into the Talk itself a couple reminders

7
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,320
uh it's really important we ask you to

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,820
please continue to wear your mask when

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,200
you're indoors if you need to take them

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,380
off step outside Master off our fine

11
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,240
outside but as long as you're indoors we

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,500
really appreciate it helps us keep

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,060
consistent with our our policy and our

14
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,460
code of conduct please try to stay

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,979
hydrated we don't want anybody to not be

16
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,240
able to enjoy the rest of the conference

17
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,920
or any other talks or the sessions of

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,520
the tracks so take care of yourself uh

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,079
please mute your phone while you're in

20
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,180
the session the audio equipment is very

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,820
sensitive and so it picks up any type of

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,920
beeps or Bings or whatever noise your

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,140
phone makes we have a fourth unscheduled

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,020
track for talks it is open to anybody

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,399
who would like to give some sort of

26
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,740
presentation or talk it's in the coffee

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,439
shop or in the coffee room you go to the

28
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,000
info desk to sign up just tell them what

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,140
you want to talk about they'll help you

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,878
find a slot and you can go give your

31
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,199
your talk

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,120
it's entirely self-service so you need

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
to bring your own laptop and plug it in

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,879
we don't have any equipment to help you

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
with that hacker karaoke is tonight at

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,560
10 pm and track one so it'll be upstairs

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,400
in DAC 416 on the fourth floor

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,780
please come if you can it should be a

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,879
lot of fun I won't be singing thankfully

40
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,739
but lots of people who can sing well

41
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,959
will be there will be some judges there

42
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,000
who judge it is a competition

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,099
and lastly volunteers are welcome

44
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,720
there's lots of volunteer opportunities

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,340
for the rest of the conference so please

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,800
if you're interested stop in room 301 or

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
go to the information desk and let them

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,800
know what you would like to do to

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,879
volunteer

50
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
so the talk right now is botnets are the

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,620
best way to measure user hostile

52
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,180
behavior on the internet with David

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,280
seedy so with that I'll pass it off to

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,379
David thank you

55
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,480
thank you very much

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,239
someone talk working at NSA once gently

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
informed Bruce schneier that worrying

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,500
about automated surveillance was silly

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
it's like worrying about your dog seeing

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,679
you naked

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,319
in many ways that comparison is wrong

62
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,239
you can't communicate with your dog

63
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,739
can't communicate with others and it

64
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,540
can't make decisions based on what it

65
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,640
sees they'll have a long-term impact on

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,860
your life for example

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,140
but one way it's not wrong is that as we

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,940
all know on the internet nobody knows

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,920
you're a dog or part of an automated

70
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,140
surveillance botnet of user hostile

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,239
behavior on the web

72
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,400
that means you can catch a service with

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,019
its pants down

74
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,760
and this can be a good thing for

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,940
everyone

76
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,700
so Sheldon Whitehouse uh is a senator

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,400
and he was wrong when he said there's no

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,980
good use for a botnet

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,659
I'm going to talk about botnets for

80
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:52,920
measurement of bad behavior on the web

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,220
as one example of beneficial botnets but

82
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,780
first I want to talk about some other

83
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,939
good uses

84
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,159
the general idea of coordinating use of

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
volunteers home systems to do beneficial

86
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,739
things isn't new the big example is that

87
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,319
botnets have been used for distributed

88
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,019
computing tasks

89
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,299
uh the first project of this sort that I

90
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,738
personally became familiar with was

91
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,500
folding at home which today has more

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,860
than 73 000 active nodes and focuses on

93
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
discovering treatments for a broad range

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,240
of diseases by simulating protein

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
folding

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,300
this was way back when I was on my

97
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,680
Packard Bell and my 14-4 modem

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,600
but the real First Volunteer distributed

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,580
computing project actually proceeded

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,440
folding at home it was distributed.net

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,199
in 1997.

102
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,960
and I have links there uh if you're

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,400
interested in the history it's actually

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,160
very interesting to read

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,380
uh so one volunteer Computing project on

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,360
distributed.net aimed to break uh

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,240
reduced round rc5 encryption and there's

108
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
a team of Hackers from Loft that

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,020
participated

110
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,300
similarly covet at home was a folding at

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,560
home project

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
and the root folds team which was

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,720
started by people from root owns gave a

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,699
talk at Hope 2020.

115
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,680
if you happen to see it if you didn't go

116
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,720
back and watch that uh

117
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,940
that talk

118
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,039
so Hacker's been involved in this stuff

119
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,100
from the beginning and continued to be

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,220
and I think it's not hard to see why uh

121
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,919
David P Anderson is the guy behind boink

122
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,080
which is an infrastructure used by

123
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,699
several distributed volunteer Computing

124
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,220
projects of this kind including the very

125
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,380
early um seti at home

126
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,600
so he's not a hacker as far as I know

127
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,479
but he voiced a very kind of hackery

128
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,520
idea

129
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,380
he said my world view is deeply

130
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,479
anti-establishment I root for the

131
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
underdog so the idea of volunteer

132
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,860
Computing which shifts power away from

133
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,240
corporations and the academic

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,100
establishment and puts it in the hands

135
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,400
of the people resonated strongly with me

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,199
he also went on to say

137
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,960
I have problems with authority figures

138
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,600
so to me privacy and hacking is tied to

139
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,460
this mentality groups of people

140
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,080
coordinating to use technology to

141
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,300
empower themselves directly without

142
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,880
dependence on others

143
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
boink is also interesting because it's

144
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,740
not just a particular project a

145
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,120
distributed computing project but it

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
provides a platform and an

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
infrastructure for developing new

148
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,100
projects

149
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,780
efficiently

150
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,580
and that's what I think we need for

151
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,280
measurement botnets too

152
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,620
so these distributed computing projects

153
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,199
are definitely examples of beneficial

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,220
botnets

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,039
but from the beginnings and through to

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,080
today most of them have been focused on

157
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,539
basic science rather than on

158
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,180
uh sort of an applied measurement of the

159
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,139
web

160
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,020
there are exceptions to that surveil at

161
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,240
home it's one used boink for web

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
measurement but it hasn't been active

163
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
since 2011.

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,180
I think but I'm interested to hear if

165
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,400
you know something else about that

166
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,139
and there may be a few other examples

167
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,639
that I've missed but for the most part

168
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,919
they're not used for measurement

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
but there are projects doing distributed

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,560
volunteer web measurements

171
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
some sites attack uh the privacy of

172
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,020
their visitors and I'll call that

173
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,500
um user hostile behavior on the web for

174
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,620
short

175
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,120
one use of web measurement is to record

176
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
user hostile behavior and so I want to

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,960
talk about a particular case of that

178
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,479
dark patterns

179
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,180
so dark patterns are a kind of

180
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,759
um user interface design pattern

181
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,560
in general user interface design

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,620
patterns arise from common problems or

183
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,539
use cases that designers have to handle

184
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,819
for example a customer needs to keep

185
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,319
track of their purchases and then

186
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,660
provide payment and shipping information

187
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,160
or a reader needs to find contact

188
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,819
information on a website

189
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,819
so what are the problems or the common

190
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,280
problems that give rise to dark design

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,919
patterns and what are the approaches to

192
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,539
solving them

193
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,639
so the problems solved by dark patterns

194
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
first of all belong to the service

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,360
provider and not to you the customer

196
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,300
visitor or other user of the service in

197
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,580
fact your behavior is what is treated as

198
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,699
a user interface design problem

199
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,879
addressed by dark by dark patterns

200
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,039
the problems designers are trying to fix

201
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,020
are things like stopping a visitor from

202
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,060
declining to receive promotional emails

203
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,399
while conveying to those who never tried

204
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
to decline that they have some choice in

205
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,440
the matter

206
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,779
or stopping a customer from canceling a

207
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,580
service um so this example is from

208
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,339
Project Iliad a project by Amazon to

209
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,959
make cancellation difficult with dark

210
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,540
patterns that was revealed in a leak

211
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,160
this year

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,380
so just to here's what it looked like to

213
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,839
try to cancel

214
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,519
with Amazon at the time

215
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,320
uh

216
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
go to the website click the hamburger or

217
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
the menu button

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,720
scroll down to find the Prime Membership

219
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,640
option

220
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,980
click manage membership

221
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,500
you then given some options in Gray you

222
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,060
click the lower one which says end

223
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,019
membership

224
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,940
seems legit so far

225
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,800
but then you're presented with a screen

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,140
you have to scroll down through and read

227
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,760
about the exclusive benefits you will

228
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,300
lose and look at a warning symbol

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,540
those include Prime free delivery Prime

230
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,000
video there's several things you have to

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
scroll through it's a pretty lengthy

232
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,959
scroll and then you get to a sort of

233
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,519
stack of buttons and you have to pick

234
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,980
not the blue one on top which says use

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,920
your benefits but the central orange one

236
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,860
which says cancel my benefits

237
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,680
uh after you click on that uh you have

238
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,180
to scroll again and read about how

239
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,800
you'll save money by switching to annual

240
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,240
payments

241
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,279
keep scrolling to learn about how

242
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,660
canceling you won't be eligible for

243
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,220
unclaimed offers

244
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,320
then you'll get to another stack of uh

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,740
buttons and once again uh

246
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,180
you might think you could click one of

247
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,820
those to to cancel but in fact nope none

248
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,959
of those lets you cancel your

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
subscription you have to continue to

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,240
scroll

251
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,579
and then at the very bottom of that

252
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,720
resulting stack there is a uh an option

253
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,060
to try to cancel

254
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,279
uh it says end now

255
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,920
and if you click that it will tell you

256
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,399
that your subscription will be canceled

257
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,579
in a month or so

258
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,220
so this came from the Norwegian

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,279
um data protection authority uh it's on

260
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,800
YouTube I gave the Nvidia slink there if

261
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
you're interested to watch it it's kind

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,260
of good to watch

263
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,459
um

264
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,459
moving

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,620
so firstly it would be absurd let me go

266
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,240
back it would be absurd to contact

267
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,700
Amazon even if there were some means to

268
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
do that without just flapping your wings

269
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,820
hard enough on Twitter to shift the

270
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,260
zeitgeist

271
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,420
it'd be absurd to reach out and complain

272
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,220
about the inability to cancel using

273
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,240
their site

274
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,100
the problem is not that Amazon's

275
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,839
designers messed up and they're unaware

276
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,100
of the effects of this cancellation

277
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,660
process for visitors

278
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,640
the design of that process is not an

279
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,980
accident on the contrary it's often the

280
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,720
result of very careful a b testing

281
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,540
against huge samples drawn from the

282
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,439
services users

283
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,140
so to understand dark patterns like

284
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,000
these you have to understand that people

285
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,079
hate them

286
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,240
but that it doesn't matter that doesn't

287
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,700
matter to the people who use them

288
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,860
so people do hate dark patterns you can

289
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,779
see there are many name and shame sites

290
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,640
where users take time out of their day

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,160
to complain in great numbers

292
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,300
here's uh at our design

293
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,120
uh there's also a tip line uh called

294
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,980
Futurity type tip line where people can

295
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,579
just complain there's a dark

296
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,220
patterns.games which focuses more on

297
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,200
addictive sorts of patterns there's a

298
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,380
dark patterns hashtag get all Mastodon

299
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,200
they're all vigorously stocked and on an

300
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,480
ongoing basis with comments from

301
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,240
exasperated users

302
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
so that's how the term dark patterns

303
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,540
caught on from this sort of scattered

304
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,000
reports from frustrated users wanting to

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
name and shame services with a

306
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,260
particular kind of user interface design

307
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,480
and that happened for long enough that

308
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,220
abstractions started to become invisible

309
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,100
a similar kind of UI solution to these

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,660
recurring problems that Services were

311
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,120
having with users and we're

312
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,380
um

313
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,380
fixing with UI

314
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,779
so dark patterns emerged in plain sight

315
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,700
from user dissatisfaction it's not

316
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,399
something that was revealed by research

317
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,560
work about recondite practices that had

318
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,500
to be uncovered these are flagrant

319
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,399
they're insulting their contemptuous of

320
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,740
the user in that they don't even really

321
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,579
bother to hide

322
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,660
at the same time the web is a big place

323
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,360
visitors are busy and mostly won't

324
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,399
report even openly hostile user

325
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,139
interfaces and the variety and

326
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,240
implementations of dark patterns

327
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,540
is large and there's they're evolving

328
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,940
so something more systematic is needed

329
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,500
to maintain an updated empirical

330
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,839
understanding of dark pattern use

331
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,940
and that friends is where web

332
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,100
measurement comes in

333
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,540
so dark patterns is a kind of nice

334
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,980
example for discussing measurement

335
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,519
because they're hard to model and so are

336
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,200
hard to automatically measure with a

337
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,300
kind of a trained classifier approach

338
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,459
but they also exist on the web in a

339
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,200
zillion different places which makes

340
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,459
them hard to measure just manually

341
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,220
you need sort of components of both okay

342
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,680
so let's talk about the two common

343
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,860
approaches to web measurement and why I

344
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,420
think neither of them is as good as

345
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,160
botnets

346
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,279
one approach is bot farming and that's

347
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,680
to kind of create and manage a fleet of

348
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,000
automated browsers that you host

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,660
yourself like a bunch of uh vps's or

350
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,240
servers in a university lab and that

351
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,459
have some sort of instrumentation on the

352
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,279
browser that supports measurement

353
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,079
the other approach is I'll call

354
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,000
piggybacking which is to convince a

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
large number of users to allow their own

356
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,420
browsers to be instrumented so that's

357
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,120
like using a special browser extension

358
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,980
so that the sites that they visit can be

359
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,320
measured

360
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,839
okay so let's start with Farming Farming

361
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,540
so creating a fleet of bespoke automated

362
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,139
browser Bots reproduces a lot of effort

363
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,959
lots of studies share require of of the

364
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,600
web share requirements uh including

365
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,100
things like invoking a specifiable

366
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,680
number of bots or recording the requests

367
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,380
and responses as a bot interacts

368
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,500
supporting keyword searches

369
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,000
it makes little sense to re-implement

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
these features every time a new web

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,399
measurement study is conducted

372
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,980
unfortunately in practice adopting some

373
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,199
existing web measurement project doesn't

374
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,600
help much because a large amount of the

375
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,579
existing code in this area is

376
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,440
unmaintained or it's difficult to

377
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,360
understand or modify or doesn't build

378
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,339
without special knowledge particularly

379
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,899
for people who are trained not to

380
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,240
produce such things but to kind of

381
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,820
design experiments and analyze data or

382
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,760
to understand privacy uh you know legal

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,820
enforcement to do with privacy

384
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,519
bot farming also requires a farm the

385
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,380
infrastructure for running the Bots and

386
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,779
that can be expensive in terms of coin

387
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,779
and time putting pressure on long-term

388
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,000
projects long-running ones like you

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,040
might use for monitoring so for example

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,380
for an academic there's little incentive

391
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,660
to maintain the necessary infrastructure

392
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,000
for a measurement study once the article

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
that it's sort of directed towards has

394
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
been published

395
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,779
so the benefits of a one-off kind of Bot

396
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,300
Farm project are usually pretty limited

397
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,940
for a regulator like the FTC Federal

398
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,920
Trade Commission in the United States

399
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,339
who might want who enforces privacy laws

400
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,600
at the federal level

401
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,519
and who might want to monitor the web

402
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,779
over time

403
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,820
re-running the study repeatedly to sweep

404
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,720
for new developments

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,860
another reason bot Services aren't ideal

406
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,540
for web measurements is that a bot's

407
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,740
behavior at a website has to be

408
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,839
automated in contrast to piggybacking

409
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
which we'll see in a moment and that

410
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,959
kind of artificial Behavior can be

411
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,000
detected leading sites to alter their

412
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
behavior so that's a kind of demand

413
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,959
characteristic if you want in the study

414
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,380
the thing being measured is uh is

415
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,420
changing based on its understanding of

416
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,579
being measured

417
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,959
and that that's a challenge to external

418
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,399
validity and web measurement studies

419
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,199
finally whereas economically and

420
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,720
administratively sharing resources among

421
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,759
the bots in a farm kind of makes sense

422
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,699
if you point diversity improves

423
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,279
measurement quality but achieving good

424
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,259
diversity is hard with centrally

425
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,759
controlled infrastructure right you have

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,899
to sort of

427
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,079
try to get

428
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,360
your hands on

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,579
resources that are spread around diverse

430
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,380
uh

431
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,660
in diverse places on the network for

432
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,699
whatever that means in for in your

433
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,740
context

434
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,299
so this is something for example that

435
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,459
studies of censorship are are very

436
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,839
interested in right diverse Vantage

437
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,520
points very crucial to understanding how

438
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,539
censorship really works

439
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,900
um okay

440
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,419
so how about piggybacking that's the

441
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,880
other approach I mentioned it's

442
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,959
convincing users to run some

443
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,440
instrumentation uh in an extension for a

444
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,880
measurement study on their on their own

445
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
browsers so that comes with its own

446
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
problems

447
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,380
um a nice example of it uh is AD

448
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,760
Observer

449
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,039
um which is an NYU project it uses an

450
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,080
extension to measure targeted political

451
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,600
ads from Facebook and Google it grew out

452
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,960
of AD Observatory and uh at one point a

453
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,480
few years ago Facebook sent a I think it

454
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,340
was actually before the 2020

455
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,140
election I want to say

456
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,880
um Facebook sent a threatening letter to

457
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,460
ad Observatory which was a predecessor

458
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,520
project and suspended accounts that they

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,760
detected to be using the tool

460
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,799
uh and I wondered if that might have

461
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,260
something to do with ghost owl which is

462
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,539
a Facebook team discussed in an article

463
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,280
uh by John Payne in 2600 a while back uh

464
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
and uh ghost owl apparently works to

465
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,940
circumvent privacy tools for Facebook

466
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,000
um

467
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,500
and to me you know it's interesting to

468
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
reflect on how these companies have

469
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
formalized a practice for circumventing

470
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
users attempt to protect their privacy

471
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,620
with these teams things like like ghost

472
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,360
owl maybe it's not called that anymore

473
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
this is a few years ago I think the

474
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
article was a little older but not that

475
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,039
old

476
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
um and also with projects like project

477
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Iliad which we saw before from Amazon

478
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,460
so if you know more about those uh

479
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,200
please do reach out I'm interested to

480
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,419
learn more

481
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,039
um

482
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,299
okay

483
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,039
but maybe the most obvious problem with

484
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,020
piggybacking is that instrumentation is

485
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,539
a burden on the user's browsing it slows

486
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,000
it down and it adds to personal privacy

487
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
risk for them right so they're

488
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
participating in a study which is maybe

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,460
measuring privacy practices or dark

490
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,500
patterns or something else that's user

491
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,880
hostile on the web so they're

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,919
contributing to our Collective uh

493
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,940
privacy but they're also

494
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,460
enduring some personal privacy risk for

495
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
running this thing on their own browser

496
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,900
the example I always think of is there

497
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,160
was a something called the security

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,980
Behavior Observatory run by Carnegie

499
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,740
Mellon CMU that collected data related

500
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,260
to privacy and security behaviors in

501
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,940
from participant systems so they were

502
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,559
interested in usability questions in

503
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,660
particular

504
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,340
and uh sometimes this meant you know

505
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,440
collecting in particular for uh

506
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,940
sensitive content you know something

507
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,460
that they've uh gathered in incognito

508
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,380
mode to try to understand how people

509
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,679
used private browsing or incognito mode

510
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,080
so obviously that work is very important

511
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
the studies were valuable additions to

512
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,080
our understanding of privacy and

513
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
usability but it's also clear that the

514
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,460
Privacy threat there's a privacy threat

515
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,780
for participants and that's in those

516
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,440
kinds of studies

517
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,700
another problem is that piggybacking

518
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,260
measurements are taken on sites that the

519
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,600
user happens to visit so as a crawl

520
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,820
strategy whatever happens to be visited

521
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,640
is sometimes desirable but sometimes not

522
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,860
so particularly for studies with only a

523
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,600
small number of participants it doesn't

524
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,640
work very well

525
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,500
um and with piggybacking there's no no

526
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,020
real choice in the matter

527
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,559
foreign

528
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,020
our experience of dark patterns as overt

529
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,299
when we encounter them I just want to

530
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,480
point out that they rely on these kind

531
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,820
of subtle features of human psychology

532
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,100
how to word a warning that's presented

533
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,360
to you when you try to take an action

534
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,000
that the server doesn't want you to take

535
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,919
at what length a path of links is likely

536
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,960
to wear people down enough to give up

537
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
canceling their Amazon subscription

538
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,460
how many or how much scrolling they have

539
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,780
to do

540
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
um how to make clear that a decision

541
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,039
will result in a future bother forever

542
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,960
right yeah but maybe later button

543
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,120
instead of a there's a yes and a maybe

544
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,380
later

545
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,880
which is left open

546
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
how to color the accept and decline

547
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
buttons in a dialogue asking for consent

548
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
to share your information so that

549
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,640
declining is less likely

550
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,679
so the prevalence of dark patterns on

551
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,260
the web and their use of psycho

552
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,539
psychology like this that's difficult to

553
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,419
model means that to measure them or

554
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,940
especially to monitor them over time you

555
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,000
need to combine automation with uh

556
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,740
manual human judgment

557
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,679
you need a measurement botnet

558
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,299
so in a measurement botnet the Bots

559
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,520
performing measurements are hosted on a

560
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,700
volunteers let's say home machine

561
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,400
volunteers install a client that manages

562
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,159
their bot the client is responsible for

563
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,559
pulling down new studies running them

564
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,720
and returning results

565
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,780
in our implementation which is called

566
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,460
mbotnet we built the client UI with

567
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,280
Argos which parses the output of shell

568
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,780
scripts and generates a kind of simple

569
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,500
panel drop down menu in Gnome

570
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,940
um there's a related project called X

571
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,280
bar that uses the same

572
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,780
um

573
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,500
syntax to generate

574
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,480
um drop downs in the menu bar Darwin

575
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,179
from Mac OS so you get that kind of for

576
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,340
free by using either one of the two

577
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
they're both great projects they're sort

578
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,780
of like a zenity on steroids if you've

579
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,000
ever used zenity

580
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,580
we try to isolate in our implementation

581
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,039
the client from the host system and to

582
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,900
wait until system resources become

583
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,880
available to run these are lessons

584
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,440
learned a long time ago from distributed

585
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,720
computing projects

586
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,820
um we also try to claim only a fraction

587
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,380
of available resources on the system

588
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,020
while it's when when the client is

589
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,520
running

590
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,220
so for the right mix of uh

591
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,500
broad availability and kind of a you

592
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,539
know possibility of installation and

593
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,179
security we implemented the client-side

594
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,159
isolation on Linux with systemd

595
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,620
sandboxing

596
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,720
um we're building for Linux and Mac OS

597
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,179
first but I just want to say I also love

598
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,520
BSD I would love to expand if I can find

599
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,360
any help

600
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,440
um so I'm happy to get into the details

601
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,179
of what we did for isolation if you're

602
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,380
interested

603
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,780
um but to summarize uh we used kind of

604
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,419
straightforward set comp filtering we

605
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,280
restricted capabilities uh use

606
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,100
namespaces and then to manage client

607
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,559
resources we use c groups

608
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,400
with Mac OS we basically don't know how

609
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
it's going to go yet

610
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,720
I initially thought since it was BSD

611
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,480
based I could use jails but I think Mac

612
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,179
OS doesn't doesn't do jails

613
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,860
interested to know more if you have a

614
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,419
view on that though

615
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,740
okay

616
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,880
um

617
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,799
so when the client is running the user

618
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,659
volunteer can schedule ride-alongs to

619
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,400
see what the bot is doing this is sort

620
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,740
of a not that interesting as a picture

621
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,960
it's just a selenium instance running

622
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,860
but it was run uh by clicking in that

623
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,620
drop down menu schedule a ride along and

624
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,120
the next site that was visited by the

625
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,120
bot uh was shown to the user

626
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,460
and this is also the functionality that

627
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
allows us to ask the user for manual

628
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,720
judgments

629
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,500
so I'll get back to that in a second

630
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,000
the automated browser code we use is a

631
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
fork of open wpm which has been used for

632
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
some great bot Farm style projects

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,700
like the web census and actually for a

634
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,799
study uh kind of one-off study but a

635
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,539
really interesting one on dark patterns

636
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,240
uh it's developed by the people at citp

637
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
and still actively maintained and it has

638
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,980
some great instrumentation that's

639
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,440
implemented and we're happy hoping to

640
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,059
expand on it and kind of share backup

641
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,299
stream

642
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,520
um the client connects to the server to

643
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,740
get more studies whenever it has extra

644
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,299
capacity rather than allowing

645
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,740
connections to come in from the server

646
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,140
and we did that because it's easy it

647
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,779
doesn't require opening up ports and it

648
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,640
reuses functionality we need any way to

649
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,440
administer the server

650
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,080
a lot of this is uh

651
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,720
beating a a direct path to what we

652
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,559
wanted

653
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,120
um and it's sort of up in the air still

654
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,760
we're looking at design decisions but we

655
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,440
wanted to have something we could work

656
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,140
with and use to understand the issues as

657
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,279
well

658
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,559
uh you know sort of running

659
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,919
uh so once the study is complete uh it's

660
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,200
compressed uh the results are compressed

661
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,960
and signed and returned to the server

662
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,120
subject to disquota and it's made

663
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,940
accessible through a researcher portal

664
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,779
researcher portal just allows

665
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,900
researchers to apply uh to register and

666
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,600
to specify studies so I said apply to

667
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,880
register I don't we're not going to

668
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,460
allow anyone to register to run studies

669
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,380
on this uh at least

670
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,840
we don't think we will uh the how we're

671
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,059
going to do vetting though is still open

672
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,039
so we're interested to think more we're

673
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,600
sort of thinking about that

674
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,360
um right now

675
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,020
um

676
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,000
study designs include a variety of

677
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,100
options including things like whether to

678
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,260
anonymize you can you can access you can

679
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,860
have the bot uh work over tour

680
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,080
um whether to try to resist bot

681
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,700
detection

682
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,559
um and then some more detailed

683
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,419
configuration parameters for the browser

684
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,659
done through user.js

685
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,179
um and again we hope to expand on these

686
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,980
if you have ideas about things that

687
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,600
would be

688
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,659
um interesting like to know

689
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,400
um one important option is whether to

690
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
include in the study manual judgments to

691
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,179
measure something because that helps us

692
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,039
to sidestep the problem of modeling

693
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,559
phenomena that are difficult to measure

694
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,779
automatically

695
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,240
so for example the researcher can

696
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,620
schedule a manual judgment about the

697
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,080
wording used on a button to sign up for

698
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,880
a subscription and it might be a

699
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,080
question of whether this is high

700
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,960
pressure shaming of the user

701
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,860
um

702
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,620
it says yes send me the meal plan in a

703
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,100
big green button or uh

704
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
I can actually no thanks I don't like

705
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,320
delicious food in Gray underneath it

706
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,659
very faintly with low contrast

707
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,080
so is that shaming the user or maybe is

708
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
it too high pressure for a particular

709
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,919
group of users maybe the elderly or

710
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,720
someone who's buying something to get

711
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,279
help with a problem they're ashamed of

712
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,080
or something else

713
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,840
or is it just being funny right it's the

714
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,220
contrast difference between these two

715
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,020
elements too great for people with

716
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,700
visual impairments of different kinds so

717
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,919
on yeah

718
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,020
so right now we've implemented just a

719
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,580
placeholder version of this option which

720
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,620
props up a window to ask a question for

721
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,600
each page visited that matches a regex

722
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,620
right

723
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,020
so more complex filters are possible to

724
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,120
trigger manual judgment but we wanted

725
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
them to be driven by actual things that

726
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,220
the researchers want

727
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,440
okay so getting manual judgment like

728
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,960
this is building on the idea from the

729
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,179
history of distributed computing uh

730
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:09,960
called

731
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,539
um distributed thinking and that

732
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,580
involves the use of volunteers on the

733
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,320
internet to perform tasks that use human

734
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,860
cognition knowledge or intelligence

735
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,080
um over the years there have been

736
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,179
so this is actually from basa which is a

737
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,700
boink project not much has come out of

738
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,460
it but the idea is certainly present and

739
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,380
articulated and has been implemented in

740
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,399
this really cool way

741
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,360
um so over the years there have been

742
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
many projects that have uh done sort of

743
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,640
manual judgment with Bots for like

744
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,440
one-off studies and again what we're

745
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,659
doing is is not a standalone study but a

746
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,360
platform for running new ones

747
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,320
um so an example of one of these

748
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,299
one-offs is dimes that was a project

749
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,860
taking measurements to try to understand

750
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,500
the topology of the internet

751
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,899
um who's connected to whom where

752
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:00,419
how things are functioning uh it ran

753
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,279
around the turn of the century I believe

754
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,000
it was an Israeli project but they had

755
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,840
participants from all around the world

756
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,380
that's what this uh pie chart is showing

757
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,659
um yeah the large segment of Israeli

758
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,520
participants makes me wonder since it's

759
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,100
a small country

760
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,320
um and so you had these kind of

761
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,340
lightweight

762
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:20,940
um

763
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,419
uh Services running on clients and then

764
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,460
after they ran you could get uh one of

765
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,320
the kind of cool things you got to see

766
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,539
was your perspective on the network so

767
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,700
that's what's shown I guess it's figure

768
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,299
two here

769
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,659
um yeah in 2004 there were 800 agents in

770
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,240
50 countries for dimes

771
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
and here's a few more projects

772
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,460
um using botnets that might be of some

773
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,260
interest

774
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,480
um I I just list them uh due to time

775
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,399
constraints but they're all definitely

776
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,380
worth a look

777
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,159
um

778
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,919
citizen browser in particular is uh work

779
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,620
by the folks at the markup who also made

780
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,140
this shirt incidentally uh beginning in

781
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,120
2010

782
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,520
um it's a platform for studies on

783
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,580
Facebook in particular uh uses the the

784
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,820
user's own credentials to log in and

785
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,799
then to capture information about how

786
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,659
Facebook interacts with with their

787
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:19,860
account

788
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,380
so that uh one of the things I think is

789
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,640
interesting about that project in

790
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,159
particular is the approach to redaction

791
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,220
because a lot of what they record is

792
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,700
specific to the account and you know in

793
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,020
order to collect it they want to to

794
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,140
minimize uh the Privacy risk

795
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,960
and so they have this kind of automated

796
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,299
redaction process

797
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,559
um

798
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,059
it's worth a look

799
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,000
they did also have a security audit back

800
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,240
when it was first introduced

801
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,419
um and it uses NG fetch which is a I

802
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,940
guess a proprietary automation Tool uh

803
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
from Neato graph but I don't know much

804
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,039
about that so uh if you do reach out we

805
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,440
can try to learn from it I think it it

806
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,940
seems that citizen

807
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,399
um browser has produced several really

808
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,399
interesting uh measurement studies

809
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,860
so it's probably a decent amount to

810
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,500
learn from what they've gone through

811
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,860
uh also Brave redirection tracking so

812
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,620
that's from 2018 it was a study again

813
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,019
one-off measuring prevalence of

814
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,899
redirection tracking so whether website

815
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,299
or maybe a third party automatically

816
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,100
redirects the browser to another domain

817
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,080
so if it's a third party what they're

818
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,299
doing is embedding uh frames and then

819
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,440
they kick off a kind of redirection

820
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,200
chain to persist data and the first

821
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,480
party case it's just the top level frame

822
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,320
that does the redirection

823
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,600
um censored Planet as another

824
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,419
relatively early censorship project

825
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,600
there are actually many uh of these not

826
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,360
uh not all it's not that common for them

827
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,440
to be

828
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,840
botnet

829
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,799
um

830
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,720
sort of design

831
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,320
um

832
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,240
so an earlier iteration of this talk

833
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,919
involved much more discussion of

834
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,260
censorship circumvention projects and

835
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,840
things that had um developed that were

836
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,460
peer-to-peer in one way or another like

837
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,360
peekabooty or a six four

838
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,080
um

839
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,960
and some of their successors

840
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,299
um but really there's a connection there

841
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,519
between the the architecture and and

842
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,019
what I'm talking about but it's not

843
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,320
super direct uh so it's

844
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,299
you know it's it's interesting I think I

845
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:37,559
think especially for questions like

846
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,179
isolation of the client

847
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,679
um it raises some interesting questions

848
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,299
but

849
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,500
um

850
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,299
you know it's not the same

851
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,980
and then surveil at home after I've

852
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,080
already mentioned

853
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,439
um was a boink project which was uh

854
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,940
design

855
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,740
so that's kind of the simple broad

856
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,360
picture of measurement botnets which

857
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,620
support

858
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,299
um a broad range of Empirical research

859
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,460
questions on the web not available to

860
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,640
bot farms and piggybacking approaches it

861
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,080
incl and includes questions about

862
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,580
phenomena that are

863
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,919
resistant to automatic detection and

864
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,760
questions that require ongoing

865
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,279
um

866
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,960
monitoring over like a large number of

867
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,760
sites something like an enforcement

868
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,559
agency like the FTC might be interested

869
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,600
to do

870
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,919
um so I just want I'm happy to take

871
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,059
questions about the details of our

872
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,919
implementation if there's interest and

873
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,500
of course also after the talk especially

874
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,299
um we've got a mailing list to talk

875
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,340
about uh some of the stuff whether it's

876
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,779
our project in particular or more

877
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,299
generally if you're doing related work

878
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,220
um but you know of course we like to

879
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,600
talk about the design of our project as

880
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,320
well

881
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,500
uh so that's the um the web uh the email

882
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,299
address

883
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,100
um and if you're you're interested in

884
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,779
contributing we've got projects going

885
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,419
looking at client isolation client

886
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,279
scheduling uh bot detection

887
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,460
circumvention also just packaging you

888
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,320
know we're

889
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,159
it's important that the installation be

890
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,599
relatively painless and that the system

891
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,579
be

892
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,399
the client be usable so also interface

893
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,839
design

894
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,940
um and then you know sort of on a less

895
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,399
technical uh note the design of

896
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,918
incentives we have fake Internet points

897
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,159
involved in this uh in this design but

898
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,320
you know how to how to do them how to

899
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
incorporate teams effectively especially

900
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,659
I mean I think that's a a big driving

901
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,339
um Force I think there have been

902
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,260
interesting insights from uh other

903
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,699
projects about the failures of external

904
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,500
motivating factors for participation so

905
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,599
paying people tends not to work well

906
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,980
it's kind of an interesting history with

907
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,980
boink in that

908
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,780
um so if you're kind of more economics

909
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,159
minded that that's something we'd like

910
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,839
to talk about

911
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,339
um and then also from people with ideas

912
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,260
for specific measurement studies so

913
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,760
we'll work with you to develop features

914
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
you want so long as they're likely

915
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,020
they're likely to benefit others

916
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,320
um as well okay so just to close whoops

917
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,140
uh that's actually not something I'm

918
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,400
gonna well we can talk about it if you

919
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,160
want to but not officially

920
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,520
um Sheldon White House is wrong botnets

921
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,900
can be beneficial and shouldn't be

922
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,940
blocked indiscriminately using bad

923
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,579
botnets as a pretext

924
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,700
uh from the early 90s at home projects

925
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,140
and related distributed computing

926
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,839
projects to today we've got we've had

927
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,160
volunteers banding together to

928
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,200
coordinate the use of private resources

929
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,660
in the public interest including teams

930
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,160
of hackers who were present from the

931
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,180
very beginning

932
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,040
so there's a like I said there's still a

933
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
rich ecosystem of measurement studies

934
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,859
that are more or less one-off

935
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,839
particularly for social media but also

936
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,700
for censorship and for a variety of

937
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,180
different kinds of practices on the web

938
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,520
so hope I've convinced you my view is

939
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,140
botnet so the best way to study user

940
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,359
hostile web practices empirically on the

941
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,680
web

942
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,740
all right thanks I'll pop on uh all

943
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,359
right so we have the opportunity if

944
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,740
anyone live audience wants to ask

945
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,359
questions there's an open mic right

946
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,040
there or if you feel uncomfortable with

947
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,780
the open mic just shout it out and I can

948
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,339
repeat it for David he can't actually

949
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,320
hear you directly he can only hear us

950
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,599
through the mic

951
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,400
there are a couple of questions in The

952
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Matrix chat so the first one is for Mac

953
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,839
with running the Linux version of the

954
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,579
bot in a Docker container be both

955
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,820
functional and sufficiently isolated

956
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,820
yes thank you for this question uh sorry

957
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,260
if there's a little delay will I get

958
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,480
Matrix up

959
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,060
it's a little bit heavy with eight uh

960
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,940
one second okay

961
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,079
um

962
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,960
yes so uh Docker right uh yeah we're

963
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,060
doing a lot of things that Docker does

964
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,099
to achieve isolation

965
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:50,700
um

966
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,520
our feeling is that Docker is

967
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,380
introducing a kind of general purpose

968
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,079
thing that our users might not need

969
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,060
remember this is kind of a

970
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,740
volunteer-based thing it's really you

971
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,380
know adoption is really

972
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,960
essential just like anonymity you know

973
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,099
measurement

974
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,740
um measurement loves company

975
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,380
uh and so we

976
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,420
sort of felt like there wasn't much to

977
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,880
be gained by working with

978
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,460
um with docker

979
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,240
um

980
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,180
that's that's the short answer but

981
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,520
yeah we could we could talk more

982
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,300
um

983
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,880
it's also a nice approach to you know

984
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,200
interoperability making it work on

985
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,220
different platforms so there's a

986
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,560
trade-off there for sure

987
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,160
um

988
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,240
but for now we thought um better to do

989
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
it this way

990
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,280
all right next question from the chat

991
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,260
room are there safeguards to keep say

992
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,180
Amazon employees running the bot and

993
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,160
saying nah that's a perfectly reasonable

994
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,020
design pattern that would skew the

995
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,960
results

996
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,579
right yes so this is a great question

997
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,400
because uh so this always reminds me uh

998
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,839
Dave Clark who was one of the early

999
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,240
architects of the internet

1000
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,740
complains forgetting I think in his book

1001
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,800
designing an Internet that people always

1002
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
come to him and say that the early

1003
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,640
Architects didn't think about security

1004
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,599
and he says it's not really right

1005
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,160
actually we just had this really limited

1006
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,320
conception of what security meant and we

1007
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,079
didn't really consider the idea that you

1008
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,520
know we were really concerned with two

1009
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,140
trusting parties communicating and then

1010
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,780
there's some uh Eve or Mallory in

1011
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,119
between who's you know messing things up

1012
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,460
but we didn't consider the possibility

1013
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,339
enough of uh kind of one of the two

1014
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,780
communicants you know being

1015
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,940
untrustworthy you know you've got a man

1016
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,500
at the end attack you've got a denial of

1017
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,119
service attack you've got sybils you've

1018
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,440
got right

1019
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,640
um so um that's something we um

1020
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,579
are thinking about we do uh have a and

1021
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,440
this actually comes up in the earlier

1022
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,060
history of distributed computing as well

1023
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,520
where you want to have some policy for

1024
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,119
um re-measuring the same uh site so that

1025
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,980
you have some notion of inter-annotator

1026
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,000
agreement

1027
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,220
and you know it's it's possible to

1028
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,900
overwhelm those things

1029
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,500
um

1030
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,700
but uh difficult and maybe detectable uh

1031
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,660
so our current idea basically is to

1032
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,280
um incorporate re-measurement

1033
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
re-measurement of of the same thing to

1034
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,839
prevent kind of poisoning like that

1035
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:27,660
yeah there's the yeah there was a funny

1036
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,920
uh

1037
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,420
if the history of hacking there's kind

1038
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,800
of interesting case of this where the

1039
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,099
time top 100 most influential people

1040
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:39,359
poll was attacked by Anonymous uh to

1041
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,280
make it say well this was the the slide

1042
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,420
I almost went to marble cake uh also the

1043
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,460
game I think is sort of an acrostic down

1044
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,720
the name the first letter of all the

1045
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,220
names in the top 100

1046
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,760
and at one point uh time introduced a

1047
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,720
captcha

1048
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
because uh it was you know they were

1049
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,780
just stuffing the pole uh automatically

1050
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,280
Anonymous uh you know participants in

1051
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,440
the Opera and uh

1052
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,900
so one of the first response that made

1053
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
to that was to try to poison to make it

1054
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,359
more effective more efficient by

1055
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,720
poisoning the capture results so

1056
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,400
the idea is that at that time capture

1057
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,440
was showing two different

1058
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,380
um sort of unclear words one of which

1059
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,900
the answer was known what the word said

1060
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,040
and the other one was an unknown thing

1061
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,800
that OCR failed on and so the approach

1062
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,099
of this group was to say penis for every

1063
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,359
unknown word just penis penis penis you

1064
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,339
know and then that would become one of

1065
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,260
the known words and it would become more

1066
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,579
uh automatable to defeat the system

1067
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,200
um unfortunately it didn't work capture

1068
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,060
is too big and there wasn't enough you

1069
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,220
know capacity to do it but it's kind of

1070
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,599
a fun since we're talking about

1071
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,700
poisoning That's a fun and and actually

1072
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,619
even further

1073
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,720
um the subsequent approach by Anonymous

1074
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,859
was uh was to Autumn to do a sort of

1075
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,960
botnet style thing where they automated

1076
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,680
the manual solution of um

1077
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
of captchas

1078
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,040
um and thought carefully about the

1079
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,480
incentive structure including things

1080
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,020
like uh like a link to viewporn while

1081
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,760
you're solving captchas one after the

1082
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,880
other

1083
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,319
I think I have let's see I have a slide

1084
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,619
actually that might be

1085
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,300
Germaine to that

1086
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,819
so yeah here's marble cake or the game

1087
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,380
it's funny that this came up actually I

1088
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,640
didn't think it was gonna

1089
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,160
uh that was the top the top 100 and moot

1090
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,660
was the number one

1091
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,359
person and uh

1092
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,160
yeah these are the different front ends

1093
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,380
they made

1094
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,240
um

1095
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,520
this is the one I think that shows the

1096
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,280
porn link there it is at the top so

1097
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,800
anyway sorry

1098
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,560
go off a little bit

1099
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,359
all right are there any questions from

1100
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,980
here in the audience the live audience

1101
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,859
no none well I have one um do you face

1102
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,599
any legal or regulatory issues or

1103
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,720
concerns that you run into in trying to

1104
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,599
promote or propagate this

1105
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,940
oh yeah that's so great yeah wow this is

1106
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,079
yeah

1107
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,119
um right so

1108
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,180
um yes one of the concerns involves the

1109
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,099
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

1110
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,339
um so is it exceeding authorized access

1111
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,700
to have an automated bot uh Circ you

1112
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,859
know overcoming barriers that have been

1113
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,140
put in place by the service provider to

1114
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,460
keep out Bots uh well it's it's not

1115
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,400
clear cfaa obviously is a dumpster fire

1116
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
but at least Van Buren was a recent

1117
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,800
decision that uh went the right way in

1118
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,839
terms of uh protecting the ability to

1119
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,460
use Bots

1120
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,560
um

1121
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,319
I interacted with a legal clinic at my

1122
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,060
what was my home institution I've since

1123
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,280
left but um and I asked them this

1124
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,140
question and they were very

1125
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,740
um

1126
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,900
sort of a gun shy I guess would be the

1127
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,460
word because the CFA has been

1128
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,740
interpreted so broadly

1129
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,079
um and there was questions about you

1130
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,060
know tortious interference with another

1131
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,040
company by by doing this kind of

1132
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,780
measurement

1133
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,940
um I think

1134
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,800
there's so there's big picture questions

1135
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,180
like that about how the law will be

1136
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,400
applied there's also like narrow ones

1137
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,260
like if your rate limiting isn't very

1138
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,599
good uh if you design this thing poorly

1139
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,700
and then like lots of people suddenly

1140
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,880
start banging on uh some sites and they

1141
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,260
and they go down and you effectively

1142
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,880
DDOS them

1143
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,839
um

1144
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,579
you're definitely going to get into some

1145
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,380
legal problems

1146
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,940
um but I think you know one of the

1147
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,680
lessons from the kind of private world

1148
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,020
of scraping is that thinking carefully

1149
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,660
about how to do that scheduling to

1150
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,099
prevent you know rate limiting to

1151
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,420
prevent

1152
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,599
um you know resource exhaustion is uh is

1153
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,880
important and is doable I mean these

1154
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,420
it's being done I think pretty well so

1155
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,800
yeah all right we have another question

1156
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200
from the chat do websites generally list

1157
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,240
to users participation in a monitoring

1158
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,400
botnet is a violation of their terms of

1159
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,260
service

1160
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,400
right yeah um so

1161
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,800
I don't know you know generally I don't

1162
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,960
read terms of service and I'm not a

1163
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,140
person with nothing to do in my life

1164
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,700
enjoys Agony

1165
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,460
um but sorry no that's not fair I'm not

1166
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,500
a lawyer I'm a lawyers read it maybe but

1167
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,579
um uh but um

1168
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,460
I guess there's a question about whether

1169
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,839
uh

1170
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,000
first of all whether something like cfaa

1171
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,859
can be applied based on violating a

1172
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,560
contract like a terms of service

1173
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,060
um I think is more or less settled that

1174
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,319
it can't you can't just put in your

1175
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,819
terms of service you're not allowed to

1176
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,460
come here uh and and then start you know

1177
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,319
criminal prosecution

1178
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,000
uh

1179
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,400
but um

1180
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,220
yeah I'm not sure how much

1181
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,780
um

1182
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,760
how that'll develop I know for example

1183
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,319
on the high Q case which is another

1184
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,020
legal case of Interest here

1185
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,220
um I believe LinkedIn sent a letter

1186
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,900
explicitly saying we do not want you

1187
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,460
doing this

1188
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,740
and there was a further legal question

1189
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,960
about once you have that letter

1190
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,359
sort of then does it more is there

1191
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,880
different different issues that arise

1192
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,440
um so I think it's a there's a kind of

1193
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Thicket of things and it's going to be I

1194
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,579
mean one of the things one of the

1195
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,680
reasons I think measurement botnets are

1196
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,780
a nice approach is that at least for the

1197
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,359
technical uh measures that are

1198
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,099
um uh deployed to try to prevent Bots

1199
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,319
um botnets are great right because you

1200
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,720
can you have a human volunteer there

1201
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,400
who's willing to explicitly say I uh

1202
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,099
endorse this bot acting on my behalf

1203
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:58,260
going to the site and doing its thing

1204
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,720
right to sort of ask someone who comes

1205
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,520
to a commercial site to have a real

1206
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,920
intention of purchasing and not to do

1207
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,839
anything that's not directly related to

1208
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,280
that is seems like it's starting to

1209
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,460
infringe on some other important issues

1210
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,420
so

1211
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,740
uh

1212
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,180
right so so there'll probably be a

1213
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,220
combination I think of things like terms

1214
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,140
of service

1215
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,180
um legal action maybe trying to make an

1216
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,280
example of people and then

1217
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,000
um

1218
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,200
uh technical approaches as well but both

1219
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,960
of them I think are

1220
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,880
well handled by a kind of Community

1221
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,300
Driven platform for for producing uh

1222
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,760
botnet measurements

1223
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,599
measurement studies

1224
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,440
and are there any other implications for

1225
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,660
doing this internationally or is this

1226
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,940
something that is more protected

1227
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,980
domestically

1228
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,880
yeah I well I um

1229
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,900
one application that we've been

1230
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,500
exploring is tied to disinformation so

1231
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,140
this is a project called the called idmo

1232
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,140
the Italian digital media Observatory I

1233
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,020
think is the acronym and

1234
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,119
um we are interacting with them and

1235
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,380
talking about whether we could use

1236
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,599
something like a measurement botnet

1237
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,680
to gain some insight onto into

1238
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,240
disinformation campaigns

1239
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,980
that's another area that are that's

1240
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,319
difficult to automate it's rapidly

1241
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,300
changing different people see different

1242
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,280
things Viewpoint diversity is really

1243
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,140
important

1244
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,400
um so there's there's maybe some

1245
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,319
potential but um

1246
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,180
at this point yeah we're kind of more

1247
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,839
focusing on making this thing well I I

1248
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,220
guess I don't want to say that I mean in

1249
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,960
some sense we're we're trying to be

1250
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,119
responsive to the people who come to us

1251
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,400
with ideas about how to do measurement

1252
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,720
studies

1253
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,819
and then produce the features that'll

1254
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,800
you know be beneficial across other

1255
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,740
studies as well

1256
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,480
um so that that implies some yeah so

1257
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,619
there's been some connections to

1258
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,559
International Studies with idmo

1259
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,940
um but other than that nothing specific

1260
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,460
or any more questions

1261
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,900
uh looks like we don't have any more

1262
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,599
questions so thank you so much for your

1263
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,520
presentation David it was uh very

1264
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,339
interesting enlightening and if you have

1265
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:21,599
any other information or links to

1266
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,640
references everyone can view them inside

1267
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,359
the Matrix chat for this this talk so

1268
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,559
you can share them there and everyone

1269
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,059
can continue to interact with David

1270
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:32,160
after the talk if you want to learn more

1271
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,540
or converse with them more so again

1272
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,920
thank you so much David and thank you

1273
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,980
audience for participating

1274
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,760
thank you very much

1275
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,140
stick around for the next talk in well

1276
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,180
15 minutes 20 minutes which is going to

1277
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,680
be on creating a general purpose

1278
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,140
Wireless net through Network mesh
