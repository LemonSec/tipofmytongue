67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,280
um an advocate for privacy that's what

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,639
i'm doing right now

69
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
i've been doing it for years but um

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
started doing it publicly which is a

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
little different

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
uh right now i'm hacking on the pine

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
phone it's a cool

74
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
not android

75
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
not apple device

76
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
and looking into machine learning all

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,759
cool stuff i'll be talking about some of

78
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
that later

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
i'm going to be

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,080
using free non-free and unknown a bit

81
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
i want to just define those terms

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
because that's often

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
not understood

84
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
when i'm talking about free i'm not

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
talking about cost i don't care how much

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
it costs talking about freeze and

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
freedom

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
if you can run

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
edit

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
contribute and share something i'm going

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
to refer to that as free

92
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
if you can't do these four things

93
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
i'm going to call that as non-free

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
if you don't really know i'm going to

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
call it unknown

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
the scope of this talk

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,639
is

98
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
specifically about passive surveillance

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
you can only control yourself

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
you can't really control what other

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,840
people do

102
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,759
so we're going to focus on what you can

103
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
do

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,919
to defend against passive surveillance

105
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,840
this is not about targeted surveillance

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
if you want to know about targeted

107
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
surveillance follow these steps

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
and then harden the systems

109
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
increase your upset

110
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
does privacy matter

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
i'm sure if

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
15 times during this conference you're

113
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
going to hear about

114
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
refuting

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,800
you know

116
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
i have nothing to hide

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
so i'm not going to get into that or

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
refute it you'll hear about it

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
but

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
there is

121
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,520
a few recent times where things out of

122
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
people's control

123
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,400
have changed

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
the way that they viewed privacy

125
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
in afghanistan

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
the united states troops pulled out and

127
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
then the taliban was the ruling party

128
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,880
so a whole lot of people were like oh

129
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
i have a bunch of things on social media

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
i need i need that all deleted and

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
social media's like i don't care

132
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
it matters um you never know when it's

133
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
going to matter

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,500
here in the united states

135
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,400
[Music]

136
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
roe v wade was just overturned

137
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
a lot of people

138
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
now care about things that they have

139
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
said in the past

140
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
so you just kind of have to be mindful

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
and you can't control

142
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,280
all the time what other people do

143
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
so

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
something that's really um

145
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
driven the direction that i've gone is

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
the edward snowden leaks i'm gonna say

147
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,919
i'm sure you know about it but to me

148
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
what it's done is

149
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
all the companies had privacy policies

150
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
before this

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
and

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
whatever snowden showed is that

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
those are just words

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
and if a company doesn't

155
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
back that up

156
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
they might be sharing it with the

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,639
government

158
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,560
it might be

159
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
how they

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
deal with your data

161
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
on their site but it doesn't necessarily

162
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
say whether or not they've been sharing

163
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,199
with another third party the entire time

164
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,000
so

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,400
in order to

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,639
come to terms with this harsh reality

167
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
you need to trust

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
what people say but

169
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,639
verify

170
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,599
and the only way to do that is with

171
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,840
free

172
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,318
software the

173
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
one common thing i see is that

174
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
proprietary systems are

175
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
more secure because they are security

176
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,198
through obscurity

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,950
if you

178
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,280
[Music]

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
look up this page

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
there's a

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,759
very detailed

182
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
accurate description of why that's not

183
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,599
true

184
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
i'm gonna talk about uh

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
two things

186
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
to back this up um

187
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,599
and on i'm not sure if you've been

188
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,040
following security news last couple

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
years but

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
um anon was a privacy phone

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,519
and

192
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,080
they never released the source code

193
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
there were some really cool features to

194
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
it that i would like to see

195
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
on privacy phones

196
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
but

197
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
when pressed they said oh it's a it's a

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
fork of graphene os

199
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
but then

200
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
allow anybody to verify this

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,519
so

202
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,760
what it actually was was

203
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
um

204
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
several

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
governments got together and made a

206
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
honeypot sting operation so they made

207
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
this cool phone said it's a privacy

208
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
phone

209
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
you can use it to message all your

210
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
criminal buddies and it'll be cool

211
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
everybody's cool we're cool you're cool

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
and it wasn't cool it wasn't cool at all

213
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
it actually had some really cool

214
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
features but it wasn't cool

215
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
the cool feature was uh the keypad would

216
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
scramble

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
so if somebody was over your shoulder

218
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,839
and they thought oh you did that combo

219
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
it wasn't actually to unlock your phone

220
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
you could be scrambled i want to see

221
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
that program it

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,279
um

223
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
the other one is apple everybody knows

224
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
apple uh

225
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
just went on a road trip

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
i saw a billboard i couldn't take a

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
picture of it because i was driving but

228
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
it said security

229
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,800
that's iphone

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,360
and that always gets me i

231
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
i laugh a little bit

232
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,000
um

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,519
you know they did that

234
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
we fought the fbi

235
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
they wanted to unlock an iphone we said

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
no

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
but

238
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
they're asking you to trust them

239
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
but you can't verify it

240
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
that's a serious problem

241
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
so

242
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
throughout this talk i'm going to be

243
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,160
talking about

244
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
different steps you can take

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
how much

246
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,279
of this matters to you personally

247
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
several people here it's gonna differ so

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,040
you have to ask yourself what are you

249
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
trying to protect yourself from i'm not

250
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
gonna be like really into

251
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,519
uh threat assessments or whatever you

252
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
just have to kind of

253
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,880
take it upon yourself

254
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
uh one way that i think about it is with

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
these different levels of production

256
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
basic it's public

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,959
what is public information

258
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
next thing is

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
interested individuals i think of this

260
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,410
as like nosy neighbors

261
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,920
[Music]

262
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
beyond that there's petty criminals it's

263
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
like crimes of opportunity they're not

264
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
actively trying to

265
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
steal your credit card or whatever but

266
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,720
if they had the opportunity would they

267
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,839
beyond that you've got criminal

268
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,720
organizations corporations governments

269
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
those are kind of self-explanatory and

270
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,839
then yourself

271
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,880
if you

272
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
don't know information you can't give it

273
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,880
up it's kind of cool

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
think about that

275
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,480
so a new campaign

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
that uh

277
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
greg's been working on it's called the

278
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,519
freedom ladder

279
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,720
and

280
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,480
this is um a new campaign with the fsf

281
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,200
this talk is about this concept but it's

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
my interpretation of this concept so i'm

283
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
going to use a ladder

284
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,440
and

285
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
the bottom of the bottom rung of the

286
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
ladder is going to be

287
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
basic things that are available in the

288
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,839
store

289
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
the top of ladder is going to be

290
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
the

291
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,399
most secure version of that

292
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
this first slide is really really heavy

293
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
i know it's late so um i'm going to

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
start with with this very important one

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,160
if

296
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
if you find that you've got to go sleep

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
at least you've seen this one

298
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
so there's a sad reality with today

299
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,639
in that

300
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,279
anything that you can buy in a store

301
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,560
is usually

302
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
not secure or in a way it doesn't have

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
your best interests in mind

304
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,240
so

305
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
apple and android i'm sure you'll hear

306
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
people debating oh apple's more secure

307
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,079
andrew is more secure i don't care

308
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
they both are doing things that are not

309
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
good for the general public

310
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
so what can you do to make that

311
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,200
better what can you do to take back

312
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,839
privacy

313
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,360
install f droid

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
it's a it's a free app store that you

315
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
can

316
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,079
load on your phone you can load it on

317
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,360
any phone

318
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
follow the instructions and then

319
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
use the apps there there are um i was

320
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,800
using a nexus 5 x before i got the pine

321
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
phone

322
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
and

323
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
i didn't load any google

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
apps on there i just used f droid

325
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
f is great

326
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
beyond that there's

327
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,639
several official android alternatives

328
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
uh in the lobby there's there's one

329
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,240
um

330
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
i used to use copperhead os which turned

331
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,040
into graphene or calyx and depending on

332
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,160
who you ask

333
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
there's lineage os which i was using for

334
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,160
many years

335
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
i'll get into more of that later

336
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
um but you can

337
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,000
flash this googleless android onto your

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
phone

339
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,399
and then

340
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
you can add google back onto it now some

341
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,519
some people need to have some google on

342
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,639
there but i think it's still a step up

343
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,320
from just having

344
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
that you get at the store

345
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
it doesn't work on every phone um i'll

346
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
show you a link where there's some

347
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
places where you can actually find what

348
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,590
phones are compatible

349
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,839
[Music]

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,519
what i like to do is

351
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,040
what i like to do is to flash a another

352
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
phone and then not put google back onto

353
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
it i just used f droid

354
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
not everybody can do that but

355
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
it's possible i was doing it

356
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
beyond that is replicant replicant is

357
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
android

358
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,800
with all the

359
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
google parts and non-free software

360
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
removed a lot of the um

361
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
graphene os e

362
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
calix lineage os they use

363
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
non-free drivers just to make it work

364
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
replicant doesn't have any of that so

365
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,240
there's less phones it works on but

366
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,079
you can somewhat trust it

367
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,639
that is separated modem

368
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
i'll get into that later

369
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,959
and beyond that is no phone

370
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,000
um

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
i i can't do no phone so i'm not gonna

372
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,279
go that high but um i know

373
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
at least a handful of people that have

374
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,000
done it so it's possible i'm a dad so i

375
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
actually need to receive calls

376
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,279
so let's uh let's talk about official

377
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
android alternatives uh i use lineage os

378
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
there's a link which devices work with

379
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
it

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
instead of going to a store and buying a

381
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
phone i i would check a list first and

382
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
then buy a by phone and then

383
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,480
flash it

384
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
uh graphene os

385
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
works on the the pixel line

386
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
uh and then there's replicant

387
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
and cool new uh campaign from free

388
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
software foundation europe

389
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
it's called upcycling android and they

390
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
kind of talk about why it's important

391
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
thing and they like tell governments hey

392
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,880
it's a really important thing

393
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,519
separated modem is

394
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,440
new cooler stuff doesn't work for

395
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
everybody um

396
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,880
right now this falls into the works for

397
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
me category uh

398
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
libra five if you can get one it's

399
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680
pretty cool it gets a little hot

400
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
pine phone is really great

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
i'm using the pine phone pro

402
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,720
as my daily driver

403
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
it's not perfect it's for developers and

404
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
tinkerers

405
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
hey we're at a hacker conference so

406
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
that's that might be you

407
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,639
um check it out

408
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
now um

409
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,519
what i spend most of the time on is the

410
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
desktop and the laptop

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
the things you buy at the store

412
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,839
don't have your best interest in mind

413
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
chrome os mac os windows

414
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,079
uh

415
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,919
but you can take most of those computers

416
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
not the not the chrome os

417
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,280
but uh you can take those computers and

418
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,720
you can flash

419
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
new software on them

420
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
so if you

421
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
if you even had that and you just added

422
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,599
a little bit of free software on it

423
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,599
that's that's a good start getting used

424
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
to those applications will help you

425
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
with the next rung

426
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,439
third one up is

427
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
using gnu linux using free software

428
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
operating system

429
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
and then using non-free software with it

430
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,160
that's still better than using mac or

431
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
windows

432
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,919
with free software

433
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,799
and

434
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,840
what we do at work is we use gnu linux

435
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,720
without any non-free software

436
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
not everybody can do that but

437
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,600
we're an example of we can do it and we

438
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,080
do do it

439
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
this is a very simplified version of the

440
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
slide

441
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,960
but um

442
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
from the moment you press the power

443
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
button on a machine

444
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
you're talking about the bios with the

445
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
computer

446
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
um

447
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,400
whenever you buy a computer from the

448
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
store it's got a proprietary bios on it

449
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
there are alternatives core boot is a

450
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,960
popular one

451
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
and

452
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,799
beyond that is libre boot which has all

453
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,840
the binary parts stripped out of it

454
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,400
there's very few motherboards

455
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,840
systems that can

456
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
run this but

457
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
if you look for them you can get them

458
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,918
you can try it

459
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,880
now we are in new york city

460
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,120
and

461
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,320
a weird thing is that

462
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
anywhere you are in new york city you're

463
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
probably within

464
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
a distance of four voice assistants

465
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
uh siri okay google alexa cortana et

466
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
cetera

467
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
i don't trust any of those

468
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,559
but um they're around all the time

469
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,080
so uh alexa buy some beans

470
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
did that work

471
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
uh

472
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
i always want to do that

473
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
uh mycroft

474
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
there's a there's a few alternatives

475
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
minecraft is one but it uses by default

476
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
it uses the uh

477
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
i want to say okay google

478
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,600
so it uses like a proxy you go through

479
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,520
minecraft servers

480
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
so you're still talking with okay google

481
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
but through my craft

482
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,160
i still don't trust that

483
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
but i have been looking into

484
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
speech to text and vosk is pretty cool

485
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
so if we get minecraft to work with vosk

486
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,360
and then you don't use a non-free gpu i

487
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,039
think that would be the

488
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,480
to be a voice assistant that i could

489
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,600
find

490
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,480
i haven't tried it yet

491
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
i don't use it

492
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
televisions are pretty easy but

493
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
in being so easy it's kind of hard

494
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
um if you go to a store

495
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
you get a

496
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
see a whole line of smart tvs

497
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
smart tvs are like the the telescreens

498
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
from 1984. they're listening and

499
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
sometimes they have cameras and that

500
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
weirds me out i have a dumb tv it just

501
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,559
displays stuff that i tell it to

502
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,240
but it's harder and harder to get dumb

503
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
tvs so that's a problem

504
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
i don't see a solution for that one so

505
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,799
don't buy them or buy used ones while

506
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
you can

507
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,600
we're going to be out of luck soon

508
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
servers

509
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,679
fsfe again has this cool sticker

510
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
there is no cloud just other people's

511
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
computers

512
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,919
so

513
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,840
self-host if you can

514
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
back to the desktops and laptop screen

515
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
you can like

516
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,559
follow that same kind of trend

517
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,159
the free software foundation we use the

518
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,520
asus

519
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,200
uh

520
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
kgp uh

521
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,120
help me out what's what's the d16

522
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
motherboard

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
kgpe

524
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,280
d16 thank you it's

525
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
kind of late

526
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
so we use that with libre boot and

527
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
triskel

528
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,679
it's a pretty good server

529
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
with routers

530
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
which you find at the store again it's

531
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
got like

532
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,919
some kind of

533
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,039
who knows what drivers on there

534
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,720
but you can find ones that can flash

535
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,880
other operating systems there's ddwrt

536
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
that has the most support uh then you

537
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,919
have open wrt which takes some of the

538
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,520
the non-free drivers out of there and

539
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,240
then you have libra cmc which has no

540
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,159
non-free drivers on it

541
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
um the

542
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
netgear

543
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,919
one of those models you can get for like

544
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
30 online

545
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,280
and then you can flash your own

546
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
operating system and then you have a

547
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,840
free router it's kind of cool

548
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
i had a lot of coffee so i'm blazing

549
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,000
through this

550
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,840
we'll have plenty of time for questions

551
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
it's great

552
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,520
um

553
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
so that's like the hardware part of it

554
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,640
um i'm going to talk about

555
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
how you can

556
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
secure those things just a little bit

557
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
i'm not going to go too too far into

558
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,760
hardening

559
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
just the basics

560
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
don't reuse passwords

561
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
don't

562
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
don't reuse like a formula for passwords

563
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,760
sometimes you'll see like uh

564
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
password dumps and

565
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,919
the end is the name of the website well

566
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
if you see that pattern then they can

567
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
guess so don't reuse passwords don't

568
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
make guessable passwords

569
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,120
use an offline password manager that you

570
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,159
can trust

571
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
keepassxc

572
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
is a good one

573
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,960
check it out

574
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
it doesn't store your passwords on the

575
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
cloud

576
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,280
you store it it's kind of cool

577
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,000
and uh another big important tip is to

578
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
only keep passwords and keys

579
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
where you need them to be

580
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
i have several

581
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
keepassxc databases and

582
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,799
i have one master one on a computer i

583
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
can trust and then

584
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,240
every other computer that doesn't need

585
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
to have all of them only has the ones

586
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,840
that they need

587
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
that's an important concept that i

588
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
haven't heard much

589
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
uh with maps

590
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
i only know of one good one and it's

591
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
open street map

592
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,880
i hear a lot of people complaining about

593
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,640
oh this this map wasn't right i sent a

594
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
request for them to fix so they didn't

595
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
fix it with openstreetmap you can just

596
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
fix it it's kind of cool

597
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
and i do that it's great

598
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,240
streetcomplete is an f droid app where

599
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
you can

600
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
modify things that need fixing near you

601
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
so if you're looking for like a reason

602
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,960
to get out of the house

603
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
you're actually doing something instead

604
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
of playing pokemon go

605
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
web browsers

606
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,440
chrome edge safari all the

607
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,960
chrome alternatives

608
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,320
uh

609
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
i don't trust those

610
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,799
firefox is very cool they're

611
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,840
doing things differently

612
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,240
and a browser icecat and libra wolf i

613
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
haven't used that last one

614
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
are all firefox

615
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,679
that

616
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,760
is a little better for your privacy

617
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
proxies use a proxy

618
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
there's a vpn's openvpn you can run your

619
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
own tor

620
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
browser fingerprinting is a very

621
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
important thing that i'm still trying to

622
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
wrap my head around

623
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,080
effs cover your tracks is a really nice

624
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,159
way to

625
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320
kind of wrap your head around this

626
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
how unique is your browser settings

627
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,400
and it'll it'll say

628
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
it'll probably say you're unique

629
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
the most

630
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
effective way to

631
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
um

632
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,760
blend in with the crowd is to use the

633
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
tor browser now not everybody's

634
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
comfortable with that

635
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,919
so

636
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
one of the projects that we've been

637
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
working on

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
is j shelter you've probably not heard

639
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,559
of it because it's kind of new

640
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,960
but it's very cool you should check it

641
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,760
out jshelter.org works for

642
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
pretty much every

643
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,320
browser

644
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
it'll

645
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
whenever a

646
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
website's javascript is trying to track

647
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
you it'll like

648
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,559
mess with it

649
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,080
i like it

650
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,919
it's it's getting better better every

651
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
day

652
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,679
ads and trackers are

653
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,880
part of this puzzle of fingerprinting

654
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
ublock origin

655
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
is a very important extension you can

656
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,320
use it on pretty much everything i have

657
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,879
it on my phone

658
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,000
it just blocks most of the bad stuff

659
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
right off the bat

660
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
but you have to install it on every

661
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
device

662
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
pie hole is a cool project you can

663
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
self-host it um it's an easy self-host

664
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,600
one if you're if you want to get into

665
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
self-hosting it's like a nice starter

666
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,559
project

667
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,080
um

668
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,960
so it blocks bad things on the network

669
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
so i have it set up at home my router

670
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,279
points to it for dns and then all the

671
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,600
devices in my house

672
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,880
check whether

673
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,919
they should

674
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,799
resolve an address with piehole first so

675
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
it blocks about 30 percent of the

676
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
requests

677
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
on average

678
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,159
and

679
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,760
that's 30

680
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,000
percent of the requests that you don't

681
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
need so your

682
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,200
the internet traffic that you do want

683
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,360
is faster pretty cool do it

684
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,679
let's talk about javascript a bit

685
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,080
um

686
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,640
when you're on the internet

687
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,279
you're running code

688
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,640
that you've probably not ever read

689
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
somebody else wrote that code and can

690
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
you trust it

691
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,200
sometimes

692
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,039
but not all the time

693
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,960
uh no script

694
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,120
made by uh giorgio

695
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,880
is a really great

696
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,960
first line of defense by default it'll

697
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,399
block everything

698
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,559
then you can go through and say i trust

699
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,000
this website

700
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,279
don't trust this website

701
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
let's refresh and see if the page works

702
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
that's pretty good

703
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,159
the fsf makes another project called

704
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,600
libra.js

705
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,159
and it tries to check the license of

706
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,679
every

707
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,200
piece of javascript

708
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
if it doesn't pass the license check

709
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
it doesn't run it

710
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,679
that will break a lot of websites

711
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,159
but you'll be a little more secure

712
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
you can also just disable javascript

713
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
entirely

714
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,430
even if

715
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,960
[Music]

716
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,159
the license is formulated correctly

717
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,080
it can still be not having your best

718
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,200
intentions i haven't seen a

719
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,039
actual use case of that in a while but

720
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,720
it could happen

721
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
so you could just disable it all

722
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,159
the fsf runs a really cool website

723
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,440
called email selfdefense.fsf.org

724
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
and it is a tutorial to set up gpg pgp

725
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
on your email

726
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,559
encrypt your emails

727
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,279
if you encrypt your emails

728
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,880
your email provider

729
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,600
that you don't run

730
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,720
can't read your emails pretty cool

731
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
i'll give you my my gpg key at the end

732
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,559
you can send me a encrypted

733
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,559
email

734
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,440
this slides a lot so bear with me

735
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
there's a there's a simple

736
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
simpler view of this um

737
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,080
free software foundation india

738
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
made a cool chart called better than

739
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
whatsapp

740
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
and

741
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
let's talk about this

742
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
um

743
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
at the bottom of the rung you got

744
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
non-free clients

745
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,320
unknown backends and centralization

746
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,399
can anybody come up with an example of

747
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,760
this

748
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,960

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,000
with an unknown back end

758
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
and centralization so that's the next

759
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
one and that's the only example i have

760

since i made this slide there's there's

783
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,320
one more that i know

784
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,480
google translates what most people use

785
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,279
but then you're sending the

786
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,880
content that you want translated to

787
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,760
google

788
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,519
and then they're sending what they think

789
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
it is back

790
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,559
if you use uh argos translate

791
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,320
you can run it yourself

792
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,919
on the command line

793
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,919
without communicating with anybody you

794
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,080
can also self-host our ghost translate

795
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,039
as libra translate

796
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,880
really cool tech it's uh machine

797

learning

798
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,080
the models are like 100 megabytes you

799
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,399
can run on really really old tech

800
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,959
super cool

801
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,840
now um

802
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320

803
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,480
stuff i've been putting in this list

804
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000

time i've been checking for 10 years now

854
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
because i have looked at the supportive

devices list then i just double checked

856
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,559
it again just for my sanity um

857
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,320
the most recent device supported on it

858
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,200
is the galaxy s2 which uh it's 11 years

859
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,840
old it's that's a it's a huge issue

860
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,960
the

861
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
problem is

862
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,880
that a lot of the newer phones

863
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
don't work without non-free software in

864
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
some way

865
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,559
so

866
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,840
is that a recommended solution

867
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,480
it doesn't work for me i'll say that

868
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,120
i've i've known people that have used it

869
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,879
that still use it

870
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,399
um

871
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,520
but

872
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,000
like i said i'm on the pine phone train

873
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,599
uh i think this is the future

874
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
but it also doesn't work yet

875
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,399
kind of works

876
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,960
my camera doesn't work for example

877
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,239
that's why i have this other phone it's

878
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,479
just a camera

879
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
um

880
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,839
i haven't used them

881
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,040
myself

882
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,199
so

883
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,760
i'm not entirely sure aren't they

884
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,440
programs that can run on

885
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
freebsd or

886
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
vst depending on which ones you're

887
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,879
running um

888
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,079
right so

889
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,280
these slides are kind of simplified um

890
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,040
comparing

891
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
open bsd without the non-free firmware

892
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,359
and

893
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,920
libre cmc and

894
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
gnu linux

895
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
with firewall software running as a

896
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
router

897
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
that's a little more advanced than the

898
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,760
stock um you'd have to actually like

899
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,359
compare those

900
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,480
three together to see how they

901
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,960
handled the load

902
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
i've known people that have used

903
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
like a full server

904
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,560
with

905
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,160
free software gnu linux

906
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,320
firewall software so

907
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,440
um

908
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,359
how do you compare those a lot of it

909
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
comes down to the config

910
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,520
as far as i know they

911
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
basically are the same thing

912
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
just different ways of doing the same

913
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,599
thing

914
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,760
first of all thanks again

915
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:39,920
like

916
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,839
stores or banks or something like that

917
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,960
you provide

918
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
monitors which don't have any

919
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,920
smart capability at all to just dumb

920
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,079
screens

921
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
though

922
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,359
that would work that's

923
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,040
maybe more expensive

924
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,440
but um

925
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,240
there's a company

926
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,720
they kind of make more lower end tvs but

927
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,480
apparently they make a couple models

928
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,839
that are still like

929
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,160
dumb tvs you know just like

930
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
regular tvs and i think some of them are

931
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,480
even made in the us

932
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,839
that's a plus if you care about that

933
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,920
cool the name was scepter

934
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
cool so like vote with your dollars if

935
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
you next time you're buying a tv buy a

936
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,880
dumb one and then they'll see that those

937
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,680
dumb ones sell

938
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,280
before more elite

939
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,520
so

940
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,359
i remember

941
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,680
watching a talk of courtroom by uh

942
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
what could you expand what is the

943
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,440
difference between a core mode and like

944
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,040
what is what is uh

945
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
lacking

946
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
um

947
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,560
mostly um

948
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
they both have uh me disabled as far as

949
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,720
i know

950
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,760
but

951
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,640
the core boot project has some binary

952
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,320
blobs

953
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
that

954
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,760
you can't compile yourself uh libre boot

955
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
is all software that you can compile

956
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,160
yourself

957
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,599
non-free binary blobs thank you

958
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,440
all right i saw a few questions

959
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,119
over there

960
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,839
red shirt first

961
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
okay

962
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
okay

963
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
you know you are right i think cars

964
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
could actually be like a whole

965
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,160
whole other talk

966
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,240
i've been struggling with

967
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,280
freedom of car tech for so long

968
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,520
and um

969
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,720
you're so right

970
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,640
[Music]

971
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
the last

972
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
i i just had like a few car accidents

973
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
happened in front of my house that

974
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,079
smashed up my cars so see

975
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,280
several card

976
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
uh infotainment systems

977
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
and they are getting worse and worse and

978
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
worse

979
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,160
my current car has an lte modem that

980
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,680
i can't turn off

981
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
and that's a problem

982
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,760
the last one before that had a wi-fi

983
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
that i couldn't turn off and every time

984
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
i i would turn it off or i would

985
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
disconnect it and then every time i

986
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,440
drive past the dealership it would

987
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,119
reconnect

988
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,320
and then it would try to update the

989
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
software and be like hey whoa oh stop

990
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,680
that

991
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,160
gotcha

992
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,839
it's a huge issue and it needs to be

993
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,920
addressed so thank you for bringing that

994
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,720
up

995
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,920
i don't see a solution um

996
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,079
you could like strip out the

997
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,400
car stereo but

998
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
now it's tied to everything in the car

999
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,960
is diagnostic so it's it's a big issue

1000
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
and i don't know how to fix it but it

1001
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,760
needs to get fixed

1002
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,078
um uh behind red shirt so um

1003
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,200
there are some

1004
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,400
free

1005
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,760
wi-fi chips they're just not the hyper

1006
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,200
cheap ones so when um

1007
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
a company is trying to make something as

1008
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,760
cheap as possible they'll oftentimes not

1009
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,520
use those

1010
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
um

1011
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
is it going to be like the brand new

1012
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,960
latest

1013
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,359
letter you know probably not but

1014
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,440
there there are free

1015
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,720
wireless

1016
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,760
cards

1017
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,920
your default bios might not allow you to

1018
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,119
boot with it in there but

1019
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,119
you can flash that and fix that

1020
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,319
i was surprised you didn't mention the

1021
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,640
brake browser are you familiar

1022
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,960
so i kind of

1023
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,760
mentioned it you mentioned chrome based

1024
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,319
browsers

1025
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
um i could say that

1026
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
i didn't

1027
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,720
right so um jay shelter project i work

1028
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,240
on

1029
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
sees a lot of the things that brave is

1030
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,119
doing

1031
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,720
and tries to

1032
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,119
implement it as an extension

1033
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,599
uh that works on firefox and chrome and

1034
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,400
extension

1035
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
it's true and they're getting

1036
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,720
more limited with the

1037
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,520
manifest v3 so it it's an issue um

1038
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,079
there's a there's a

1039
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,440
within the free software community

1040
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,359
there's a big uh

1041
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,240
discussion about chrome chromium and the

1042
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
the

1043
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,319
freedom of it and it's

1044
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,119
uh

1045
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,880
i'm not going to get into it but it's an

1046
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,680
issue

1047
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,000
um

1048
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,720
it's a complicated issue

1049
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,480
um

1050
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
i do

1051
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,240
um

1052
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
i don't have a good one though uh you

1053
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,079
can self-host some there's a yaki i

1054
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,119
don't know if i'm saying that right

1055
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,280
y-a-c-a no y-a-c-y

1056
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
um

1057
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,440
there's another one you can self-host

1058
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,800
that i forget the name of because it's

1059
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,680
late

1060
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,359
um

1061
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,839
there's like proxy ones that use google

1062
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,160
but you're not using google uh start

1063
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,599
page is one

1064
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,040
um

1065
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
but then you're trusting that start page

1066
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,280
is doing what you

1067
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,240
yeah

1068
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,319
uh there's duckduckgo

1069
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,319
um

1070
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,800
um

1071
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,640
and i think part of this too is i mean

1072
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
like we're very much about it but

1073
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,839
you know the minute i talked to my

1074
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,240
partner about

1075
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,440
is you know um what would you recommend

1076
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
is the

1077
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,839
best practical advice

1078
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
for

1079
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,160
the rest of people who are not going to

1080
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,160
necessarily

1081
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,119
right so

1082
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,480
the number one way to make something

1083
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
accessible is to have things that you

1084
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,040
can buy you know if you go to a big box

1085
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,480
store

1086
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,400
there's nothing that you can buy off the

1087
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,200
shelf that fits into these higher rung

1088
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,680
ladders

1089
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,640
so we need more people making those

1090
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,599
things that are accessible

1091
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,599
to the beginning of that question

1092
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,359
is how can you

1093
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,880
how can you approach the subject with

1094
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
like significant others and things

1095
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,280
i know i struggle with this quite a bit

1096
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,560
um but you know those people better than

1097
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,800
i do so you

1098
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,960
in general you gotta like find their

1099
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
interests and

1100
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,880
lead them to follow their interests so

1101
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,720
if they're you know musicians

1102
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,119
show them some cool musician software

1103
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,880
that

1104
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,839
you can

1105
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,980
have the four freedoms with

1106
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,079
[Music]

1107
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,280
and that can go with any category uh

1108
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,240
artists

1109
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,479
there's krita you can do cool stuff with

1110
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,400
name something there's there's plenty of

1111
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
software out there

1112
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
uh whether like

1113
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,920
they're gonna get to the top rung of all

1114
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,160
these ladders you know probably not

1115
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,119
um am i going to no yeah

1116
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,240
but

1117
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,520
you just got to kind of follow their

1118
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
interest and

1119
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,960
make suggestions maybe try something out

1120
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,240
maybe build something for them

1121
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
oh didn't see you it's a it's a wide

1122
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,520
room sorry sir

1123
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
um

1124
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,800
i'm glad you brought up those because

1125
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,560
those are all really cool projects i

1126
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,440
love them

1127
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,319
um

1128
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,599
so

1129
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,400
when people communicate

1130
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,839
sometimes

1131
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,520
you have to read what they wrote

1132
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,880
somewhere that

1133
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,640
you aren't

1134
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,359
so

1135
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,000
knitter it allows you to read twitter

1136
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,599
without

1137
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,800
telling twitter that you read twitter

1138
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,319
it's cool and you can self-host it

1139
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,720
that's really great new pipe

1140
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,920
is a android app that is better than the

1141
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,640
proprietary youtube app

1142
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,040
you can download

1143
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
youtube videos you can download audio

1144
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
you can

1145
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,960
listen to things uh with the phone

1146
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,400
turned off that's like an advanced

1147
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
feature that you got to pay for that's

1148
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,800
ridiculous

1149
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,240
new pipe's great

1150
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
um

1151
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,720
what else bibliogram is uh instagram

1152
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,839
without

1153
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,920
instagram um it's it's cool stuff but

1154
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,839
you know it's

1155
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,000
if you compare to that that chat slide

1156
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,400
you know it's free software

1157
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,839
free client

1158
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,560
with a non-free backend so how much you

1159
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,960
participate is is up to you at that

1160
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,319
point

1161
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,160
but it's at least giving you the option

1162
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,480
to not share data that you don't want to

1163
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,839
share

1164
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,000
so it's cool that it puts some of that

1165
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,319
data control in your

1166
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,319
control

1167
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,319
you threw a lot of front ends at me did

1168
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,000
i cover them all

1169
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,960
knit or billy graham

1170
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,319
there's a scribe rip which is one for

1171
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,240
medium it's pretty cool there's a

1172
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,920
there's a browser extension that you can

1173
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,240
automatically like rewrite the the urls

1174
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,800
to those it's pretty cool

1175
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,319
um

1176
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,000
good question

1177
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,839
all

1178
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,720
right

1179
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,640
um i was wondering if you could mention

1180
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,680
two geeky things uh one is a geeky thing

1181
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,680
that's very cool and one is a geeky

1182
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,280
thing that's very bad

1183
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,680
uh those two things are discord and

1184
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
gemini

1185
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,480
um i would love to talk about discord in

1186
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,680
germany

1187
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,480
um

1188
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,960
so discord is a

1189
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,400
aggressive

1190
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,240
non-free client

1191
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,760
with an unknown back end

1192
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,520
some terms of service where you can't

1193
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,839
make a free client for it now i was

1194
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,359
using a free client for it on the

1195
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,160
command line and it was awesome but then

1196
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,000
uh that became an abandoned project i

1197
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,280
forget the name of it it was written in

1198
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,040
golang was pretty cool

1199
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,839
but it doesn't work anymore

1200
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,680
right i wasn't banned um but

1201
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,920
man it was it was so good for a little

1202
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,000
while no

1203
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,280
um

1204
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,200
so i do have a lot of friends on discord

1205
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,240
and

1206
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,280
i use the web client which isn't

1207
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,200
it's like non-free javascript i don't

1208
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,280
like it i would love a

1209
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,040
solution if you find a solution email me

1210
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,400
uh

1211
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,200
gopher gopher is like the small small

1212
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,240
web

1213
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,880
uh s-m-o-l

1214
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,760
um

1215
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,559
it's like a re-envisioning of web pages

1216
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,839
without all the

1217
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,800
html and css it's like

1218
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
super limited

1219
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,520
i think it's a cool idea

1220
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,040
but when you take out all the

1221
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,200
interactivity of the web you're going to

1222
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,880
lose out on

1223
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,940
shopping and

1224
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,839
[Music]

1225
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,200
pictures

1226
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,319
gifs

1227
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,640
videos like

1228
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,000
sharing video there's a lot of cool

1229
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
stuff on the web that you can do that

1230
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,480
you have to have

1231
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,839
all this cool tech that we've built

1232
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:48,720
um

1233
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,480
so i i think it's gonna be like a

1234
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,839
cool geeky thing that's not gonna have

1235
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,160
much use

1236
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,919
right

1237
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,920
that was a hope friendly thing but not a

1238
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,520
new york city friendly thing just

1239
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,400
repeating it back for the mic

1240
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,359
so

1241
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,880
i have not used it

1242
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,760
i've

1243
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,040
read about it

1244
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,240
and

1245
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,599
there's some really cool stuff with it

1246
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,400
it has

1247
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,240
referring to these slides

1248
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,200
it's like free software with non-free

1249
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,480
drivers

1250
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,640
so that it works on like a lot of

1251
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,359
hardware so it's got that um working

1252
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,040
against it but then

1253
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,680
a lot of the design of it is that you

1254
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
can run things that you don't trust on

1255
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,920
your system

1256
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,720
um

1257
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,240
a lot of what i've been talking about is

1258
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,040
running things that you do trust

1259
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,720
um

1260
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,800
but i i have

1261
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,599
uh

1262
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,040
i have heard

1263
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
a cool use case for it uh or at least

1264
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,319
that

1265
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,240
type of tech you could apply it to

1266
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,680
whatever other system say you get a pdf

1267
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,599
and you don't trust the pdf you want to

1268
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,240
open the pdf you could open up a

1269
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,760
container

1270
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,359
open up that pdf view the pdf

1271
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,960
and hope that it wasn't malware that can

1272
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,119
escape the container

1273
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,480
but uh

1274
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,079
we're at a hacker convention so like

1275
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,160
maybe we'll see some pdfs that escape

1276
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,799
containers this weekend

1277
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,160
right

1278
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,800
there's a way to

1279
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,880
manage malicious

1280
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,079
right and

1281
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,280
at the end of the day it kind of comes

1282
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,160
down to how much

1283
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,520
how much are you comfortable with

1284
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,440
yourself um

1285
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,359
and everybody's threat assessments are

1286
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,839
going to be different

1287
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,640
um

1288
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,960
how high everybody's gonna climb up each

1289
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,720
ladder is gonna be different so um

1290
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,839
a regular um distribution

1291
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,760
just because the regular linux

1292
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,280
distribution

1293
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,520
well

1294
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,000
those open things yes the bugs could

1295
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
happen but there are

1296
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,640
a lot of

1297
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,800
there are a lot of things that far zero

1298
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,680
days that do get exploited

1299
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,559
right so

1300
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,559
one thing i would like to see is a lot

1301
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,720
of these like top tier thing

1302
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,800
a lot of these top tier options

1303
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,520
are piggybacking off the work of others

1304
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,040
so um triskull is an operating system

1305
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,599
made by a friend of mine ruben rodriguez

1306
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,839
and it's uh

1307
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,119
ubuntu

1308
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,480
you know ubuntu

1309
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,800
but it's ubuntu without all the non-free

1310
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,960
software

1311
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,000
so what i would like to see is cubes

1312
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
given the same treatment i would like to

1313
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,839
see either cubes themselves or someone

1314
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,240
else um

1315
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,319
either make a secondary version of cubes

1316
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,040
or

1317
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,240
a

1318
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,559
cube's libre fork

1319
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,000
that just

1320
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,839
solves i think it's like a small issue

1321
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,599
like just strip out use a different

1322
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,920
kernel uses the linux library kernel and

1323
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,520
then like that pretty much solves

1324
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,920
everything i'm talking

1325
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,920
right

1326
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,359
but it's all like a matter of trade-off

1327
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,839
so

1328
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,480
a lot of um

1329
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,079
a lot of it comes down to convenience if

1330
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,520
somebody makes a new distro that gives

1331
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,440
something as a default then more people

1332
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,280
are likely to use that

1333
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,720
um

1334
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,559
you can compile whatever kernel you want

1335
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,880
for whatever distro you want you know

1336
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,799
no one knows stopping anybody from doing

1337
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,480
that and nobody's stopping anybody from

1338
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,240
forking a free software project and

1339
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,640
doing whatever they want with it so

1340
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,319
it's just a matter of like volunteer

1341
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,720
hours if anybody like really wants to

1342
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,359
see that then they'll do it um

1343
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,680
it's beauty

1344
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,000
yeah but um

1345
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,520
you know there's

1346
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,359
you ever played watchdogs you and it's a

1347
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,880
proprietary video game that like

1348
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,440
analyzes this exact situation it's

1349
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,839
hackers running around smart cities

1350
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,119
um it's a problem you know and

1351
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,200
we can mitigate that with

1352
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,799
laws

1353
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,480
several states have

1354
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,559
banned facial recognition

1355
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,920
that's a good first step

1356
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,640
you know

1357
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,319
some of it's things that are out of your

1358
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,160
control so you can get like super into

1359
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,559
politics and local politics and you can

1360
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,799
try to make issues and prevent things

1361
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,319
before they become a reality

1362
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
but

1363
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,119
most of this talk is about focusing on

1364
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,280
starting with yourself

1365
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,440
freeing yourself as much as you can

1366
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,040
and hopefully spreading that to

1367
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,280
others that might be interested in

1368
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,760
freeing themselves

1369
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,839
freeing your

1370
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,480
city

1371
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,160
you know

1372
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,440
there's a lot that

1373
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,760
uh there's there's a lot of like city

1374
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,280
infrastructure that is free um

1375
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,359
public transportation all those like

1376
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,000
kiosks you know they're probably run on

1377
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,400
free software you know the api that

1378
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,160
keeps track of all the times

1379
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,280
um

1380
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,559
it's probably free software in the back

1381
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,480
end yeah a lot of it history that's

1382
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,440
that's it's a really cool part of it

1383
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,520
is it free for you you know maybe not

1384
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,839
but

1385
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,359
get active in local politics you know

1386
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,000
make it an issue

1387
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,240
you mentioned before

1388
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,200
which is great but it's impractical to

1389
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,319
everything

1390
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,240
totally which means that

1391
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,880
you basically have to use either a vpn

1392
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,720
or a proxy that's shared with other

1393
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,040
people right because if you self post

1394
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,480
then you're still tied to one idea

1395
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,000
the problem of

1396
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,040
choosing a vpn that's trustworthy

1397
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,720
and as far as i know there's no good way

1398
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,839
to do it it's all reputation based

1399
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,359
and there isn't any hard data um

1400
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,319
there's a

1401
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,559
there's this ranking by torrent freak uh

1402
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,520
yearly

1403
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,760
uh where vpn providers

1404
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,280
answer a bunch of questions which is

1405
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,000
great but it's still based on trust like

1406
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,200
trust us this is what we do so right you

1407
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,558
or the fsf

1408
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,799
we don't

1409
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,000
um

1410
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,079
but we thought about it so um

1411
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,640
this kind of goes back to the trust but

1412
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,839
verify

1413
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,599
um

1414
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,520
these vpn providers are coming up with

1415
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,799
privacy policies they're answering

1416
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,040
questionnaires like you said

1417
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,960
and you have to take their word for it

1418
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,000
and

1419
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,680
sometimes you'll see um

1420
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,240
unknown back ends that publish code and

1421
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,000
they say this is our back end code

1422
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,319
can you verify that they are running

1423
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,480
that code on the server

1424
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
now a lot of the vpns are probably

1425
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,400
running openvpn which is free software

1426
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,839
but

1427
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,680
how do you verify

1428
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,440
that software

1429
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,040
that someone else is running on their

1430
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,839
server without

1431
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,599
sshinging into that server and checking

1432
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,480
it out

1433
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,160
um it's like a problem

1434
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,160
so that's something then you have to

1435
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,799
trust the auditor and like it's

1436
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,520
it's tricky it's tricky

1437
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,400
right

1438
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,559
auditor's coming

1439
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,960
loaded up that second image you know

1440
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,040
it's

1441
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,559
that's a little more paranoid you know

1442
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,640
but

1443
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,720
it's it's an issue you can't verify it

1444
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,000
that um come together and do it but that

1445
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,240
needs some sort of leadership

1446
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,880
and you know ssf could be

1447
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,000
such an organization

1448
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,920
maybe

1449
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,040
problem is

1450
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,480
fsf's like 14 people uh four of them are

1451
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,760
in this room

1452
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,880
and

1453
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
we are doing so much stuff we got our

1454
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,079
hands in so many pots

1455
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,559
every time we come up with a new idea we

1456
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,480
run it then all those ideas are going to

1457
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,920
be badly executed

1458
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,720
so it's an issue

1459
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:07,680
but

1460
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,440
you can self-host

1461
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,960
openvpn

1462
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,200
so if you're the tech savvy person in

1463
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,520
your group you could say

1464
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,880
i know that

1465
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,680
trusting vpns is a is an issue i'm

1466
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,520
self-hosting it let me show you how i'm

1467
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,920
doing it

1468
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,720
help me run the server fees or power

1469
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,040
costs

1470
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,920
so i do know some people that that run a

1471
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,040
business

1472
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,040
doing vpns and

1473
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,119
do i trust them more than other people

1474
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,079
you know

1475
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,280
i don't know

1476
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,280
um

1477
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,610
but
