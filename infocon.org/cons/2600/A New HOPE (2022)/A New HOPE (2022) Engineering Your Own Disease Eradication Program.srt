1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,820
so I want to start by thanking people

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,120
because one of the things that

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,700
happens because I'm the only person who

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,620
really steps out in public to represent

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,660
the collective a lot of people sort of

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,179
think that I am the collective I'm not

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,699
I'm actually kind of the least important

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,140
person in the collective I get to come

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,539
brag about what all these amazing people

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,859
that I'm lucky enough to get to work

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,000
with do

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,279
and so

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,779
I know they're all out there I know

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,980
they're watching from all over the world

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,180
and it's just important for me to remind

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,860
all of you that

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,559
if you see something that's awesome

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,540
and applaud your applauding for them and

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,540
if I bow I'm bowing on their behalf

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,280
so

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,480
um

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,260
the other thing that is important to put

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,020
out at the at the outset you know before

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,059
the plague we were kind of the only

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,620
people who were ranching and raving

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,239
about health stuff and suggesting that

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,680
there are alternative ways to go about

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,820
it

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,059
and um some people have some feelings

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,400
about how some people have conducted

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,460
themselves around the current plague and

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,280
two

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,479
differentiate ourselves in the way we

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,760
think about how people should manage

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,360
their own health

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
it is Paramount for us to State at the

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,680
outset that

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,000
we're not saying you should do anything

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
in particular we found some things that

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
we think are cool

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
and we think that we're taking a look at

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,159
and

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,259
you should make a decision for yourself

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,299
as to whether you think it's good for

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,020
you for your risk profile for your body

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,899
type for any number of variables your

47
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,060
philosophy for how you'd like to manage

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,159
your own health managing your own health

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,680
is a human right it's a very important

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,700
human right we believe it's the first

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,240
because if you don't have your health

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240
it disallows you access from managing

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,219
all the rest of your rights

54
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,780
it doesn't deprive you of your life

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,060
necessarily if you're dead it does

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,160
however

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,140
if you're sick

58
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,640
it deprives you of being able to

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,739
interface with all the things that make

60
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,000
life meaningful

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,959
and then the third thing that whoa what

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,140
happened

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,959
oh thank you the other thing that's

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,040
important to mention is that we don't

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,300
invent anything

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,280
we don't really do research and

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,019
development

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,660
what we do is we look at things that are

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,220
on the Shelf technologies that are

70
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,300
established

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,739
things that have either been neglected

72
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,300
or not pushed through or that are too

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,819
expensive and when we hijack them so

74
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,860
we're not coming up with a new idea and

75
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,239
saying hey wouldn't this be cool we're

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,860
looking at cool ideas that other people

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,900
had that you can't get for whatever

78
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,160
reason

79
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,660
so

80
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,620
with that I'd like to State the

81
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,980
following

82
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,500
Iams again so happy to be here with all

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,980
of you and I swore off virtual talks

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,840
because they were so frustrating to look

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,800
out into just a little dot on my screen

86
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,000
and If all we're doing is trying to do

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
this again I I don't see the point I

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
want to

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,300
make sure that this is as interactive as

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,980
possible

91
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,060
um

92
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
so

93
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,840
here's what I'd like to do in the

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,959
interest of doing things backwards

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,120
I

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,799
want to chat

97
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,180
we're all here

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,239
that's what makes this special

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,860
so

100
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,980
to remember how important it is that

101
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,840
we need to seize what we've got

102
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,939
I'd like to take questions first

103
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,939
and here's how I'd like to do it

104
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,920
I want people to come up um I I guess

105
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,180
there are microphones that can be handed

106
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,439
around here in the back you see somebody

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,099
waving a a microphone and

108
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,659
um they'll come around if you put your

109
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,700
hand up and I want to spend a few

110
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,620
minutes

111
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,120
and I want to know what everybody's

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
interested in

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,019
it's very easy to sort of run an

114
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,060
independent research program and hang

115
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,220
out with people who have their heads in

116
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,720
the game and think about what we think

117
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
would be cool but if the whole point is

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
that we're a Public Health Organization

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,419
we need to know what everybody else

120
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,699
thinks is important

121
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,280
um so we're gonna do if I can get this

122
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
selector switch to work as it's supposed

123
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,320
to I here we go so

124
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,080
if you're shy about having the

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,020
microphone you can also go to this

126
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,360
website and use this code and any word

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,340
that you put in should pop up on this

128
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,240
screen

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
and hopefully after we chat for a few

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
minutes

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
we will know about

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,620
what sort of medicines you're interested

133
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
in

134
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,080
hijacking or using or getting access to

135
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,100
and what sorts of illnesses or ailments

136
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,199
that you think are underrepresented or

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,199
need more attention in terms of the

138
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,360
medical sphere so

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,900
let's start with questions anybody have

140
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,859
something in mind over here yes

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,960
well just take it I don't hear very well

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
all right real quick question uh Roe v

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,880
Wade uh women's autonomy and the

144
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,000
application of how we can actually give

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,979
women autonomy in states that may not

146
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,900
allow them to have autonomy

147
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,940
okay cool can somebody um type that in

148
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,220
so it goes up there

149
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,280

years ago about how to make your own

171
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,280
abortion pills and pressing the pills

172
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,020
are you gonna

173
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,360
distribute any information or have any

174
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,699
ideas about Distributing that stuff

175
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,220
since that's kind of the harder part of

176
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,380
the equation yeah important question

177
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,699
yeah somebody would throw that up there

178
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,680
that's uh that's that's something we

179
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,720
definitely should talk about

180
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,340
um yeah cool and then right there was

181
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,080
one up here yes yeah so there's

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,419
nootropics on there but

183
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,280
um I'm interested in nootropics comedy

184
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,099
Nations because how do you stack things

185
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,720
and what synergizes with others and what

186
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,680
doesn't

187
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,080
okay cool thank you again can somebody

188
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,340
make sure this ends up in our award

189
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,199
class this is so pretty

190
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,039
um

191
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,139
uh thanks to the fellow who did this for

192
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,460
us again okay cool all right yeah there

193
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,020
oh hey there

194
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,520
hey buddy

195
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,319
um so speaking of uh neurotropics and

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,120
stuff like that do you guys also focus

197
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,520
on enhancements not just Health such as

198
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,259
like maybe myostatin or full Statin

199
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,360
inhibitor or something like that oh yeah

200
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,860
okay yeah

201
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,000
um there are there are a handful of

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,280
enhancement things that we have had in

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,840
the the interesting thing about

204
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,220
enhancement I'll just say this in

205
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,940
between questions is that

206
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,620
philosophically I don't differentiate

207
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,780
between therapy and enhancement

208
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,660
uh again it's it kind of comes out of

209
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,699
the anti-ableism space where it's like

210
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,500
what is enhancement what is therapy what

211
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,300
is normal so anything that makes things

212
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,580
better that qualifies as a medicine so

213
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,860
yeah

214
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,440
hey I would like to know more about how

215
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,139
to gauge the efficacy of adaptogens

216
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,479
specifically like mushroom adaptogens

217
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,280
oh all right yeah that's a good one as

218
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,539
well somebody throw that up there as

219
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,039
well okay cool

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,560
all right uh I maybe one or two more

221
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,660
we're getting a good we're getting a

222
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,199
good stack here I love the way it dances

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,099
one more okay cool we'll do one more

224
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,759
all right

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,900
yeah um I just want to plus one I'm

226
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,299
sorry I just want a plus one uh the

227
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,539
immune autoimmune uh item that's up

228
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,039
there especially since sometimes the

229
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,360
interventions aren't necessarily

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,099
profitable so they might be something

231
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,899
that lend themselves to DIY because

232
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,219
there's not a lot of medical research

233
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,779
into that so like Lyme disease and other

234
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,060
immune autoimmune stuff

235
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,420
great thank you okay cool so here's how

236
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,440
we're going to do this I'm going to take

237
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,980
a look at this I'm going to try and see

238
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,160
what we have in terms of things that I

239
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,500
can address right now

240
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,360
I've got

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
two three four five six

242
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,940
um okay and then

243
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,660
um

244
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,720
hopefully this will stay yeah that's so

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,279
cool

246
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,320
all right well I mean I don't I mean

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
it'll stay like this I just mean like it

248
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
won't go away and and here's the thing

249
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,720
what

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,540
what we'll do is anything that we don't

251
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,060
have for we will put on the stack now

252
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,800
there's a long list of things that we

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,160
you know are trying to address but

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,660
there's a

255
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,660
there's a lot so let's take a look here

256
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,580
um well DIY medicine encompasses

257
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,500
everything we do so that's pretty good

258
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,980
uh yeah seems like abortion's a big one

259
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,440
we should probably talk about that right

260
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,920
yeah okay all right we'll do that

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,940
um

262
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,600
uh HRT that's a we have something for

263
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,580
that in the pipeline

264
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,200
um that also falls under the steroids

265
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
category uh trans stuff oh Roe v Wade

266
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,899
okay that ties in

267
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,720
um self-experimentation uh for that one

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,660
specifically the chalk that we gave at

269
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,079
uh last year's Defcon gives a good

270
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,180
system for doing an N equals one trial

271
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,240
um and diagnosis info ooh okay we're

272
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,220
gonna have to talk about that one gene

273
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,300
therapy that one's hard

274
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,579
um but not impossible autoimmune

275
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,740
definitely want to talk about that okay

276
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,779
cool

277
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,360
um nootropics uh cost of course that's

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,339
in everything

279
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,620
um injury repair oh yeah that's a hard

280
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,720
one that's a hard one

281
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,899
um but not impossible okay cool

282
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,820
all right I think

283
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,740
we have a table of contents for our talk

284
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,260
let's uh let's let's go

285
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,180
let me just adjust one or two things

286
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,360
here and we should switch over and this

287
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,620
should be

288
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,399
coming up

289
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,939
come on

290
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,459
there we go okay

291
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,720
so

292
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,940
uh first thing that I'll introduce that

293
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,560
falls under a lot of the categories that

294
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,540
were up there in terms of DIY stuff is

295
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,300
the new tools we have a new stack of

296
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,920
tools a microlab was sort of our

297
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,899
Flagship project and has been for a long

298
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,140
time and we have a new version of it but

299
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,720
what's really cool is not that we have a

300
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,579
new version of the micro lab but that we

301
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,360
have a whole software suite of stuff

302
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,240
that's uh live and available that

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,880
makes this easier to use because in the

304
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,140
early days it was kind of like hey we

305
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,820
did a project and you could too if you

306
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,940
wanted to go through all this pain but

307
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,660
um

308
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,459
so some of the new things about the

309
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,040
microlab is that there's this nice cute

310
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,019
little touch screen it doesn't require

311
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,480
another computer

312
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,620
um you don't have to solder anything

313
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,019
everything is screw terminals or snap

314
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,200
together so it's very easy to assemble

315
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
um we had a video of it at one point

316
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,620
where I think one of our Hardware guys

317
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,720
assembled it and something like you know

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,480
20 minutes it was it was really cool but

319
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,240
again the hardware itself the way it

320
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,680
works hasn't changed a whole lot for

321
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,180
those of you who are unfamiliar it's an

322
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,139
automated

323
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,720
uh chemical reactor that you can build

324
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
yourself with off-the-shelf components

325
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
and it will help you through chemical

326
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,000
synthesis if you're looking for an API

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,920
you can do this now again this is a

328
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,300
small molecule chemistry so if you're

329
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,700
trying to make something like an enzyme

330
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,920
that's a whole different monster but if

331
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,200
something is small enough that you can

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
draw

333
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,060
the molecule on a napkin then it's

334
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,380
accessible

335
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,060
now of course the question has always

336
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,100
been like well all right that's fine but

337
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,860
how do you run the thing so this takes

338
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,019
us to uh one of our newest pieces of

339
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,720
software that is so exciting which is

340
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
it's called The Recipe press and this is

341
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,839
live

342
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,820
um it's accessible on our website and I

343
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,079
should be able to jump over and actually

344
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,220
use it but what it does is it allows you

345
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,860
to

346
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,860
generate a file that the hardware will

347
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,139
run previously you had to code it hard

348
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,060
and it's like you know sort of like

349
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,860
Python and of course for I imagine for

350
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,120
most people in this room that's not a

351
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
big deal but

352
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,180
the goal is trying to increase access

353
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,980
one of the key things is trying to make

354
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,720
things less technical so you don't have

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,180
to know how to code so this nice system

356
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,160
of pull down menus where you can just

357
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,079
muck around and I'll show that in a

358
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,000
minute

359
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,120
um

360
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
you can go through and just if you have

361
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
a procedure for manufacturing molecule

362
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,800
you just create a step for each one uh

363
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,839
in the pull down menu it allows you to

364
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
do

365
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,079
whatever you want and again you can

366
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,620
control temperature you can stir you can

367
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,959
uh have the syringe pumps push reagents

368
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,820
into the reaction chamber you can have

369
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,620
it wait for a certain amount of time and

370
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,360
you can also have it prompt the user

371
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,100
this is a really important thing that I

372
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,660
think is critical

373
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,699
when we talk about automation right it's

374
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:08,519
a marriage of having a human and a

375
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,260
machine work together you want the

376
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,699
machine to do the things that are easy

377
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,680
for a human to screw up and you want the

378
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
human there checking the things that a

379
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,339
machine won't understand and so one of

380
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,740
the best things about this is that it

381
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,699
has a branching process so you can say

382
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,980
ask the user is the solution still

383
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,339
cloudy or is it now clear and again it's

384
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,380
like it's still cloudy then it can then

385
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,940
iterate it's like you just need to stir

386
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,740
for longer you can put that in and you

387
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,120
can have a decision tree in the system

388
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
this one's super awesome I know uh some

389
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,660
of you remember us trying to hijack this

390
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,100
years ago

391
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,980
and we finally did it and it's so much

392
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,019
fun

393
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,339
there was a group called kematica that

394
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:57,899
we try to do business with very very

395
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,420
early on they were very quickly absorbed

396
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,660
by Mark and their technology is now on a

397
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,459
shelf somewhere but what they did was

398
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,959
very very clever

399
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
they essentially utilize data science to

400
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,920
try and figure out new ways to

401
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,399
synthesize molecules the first way is it

402
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,680
Combs through all of the history

403
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,600
of all the chemical literature that's

404
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,620
out there

405
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,660
and what it does then

406
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,100
is this is live but like just give it a

407
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,600
minute if everybody logs on right now

408
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,420
like it'll just lock up theoretically it

409
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,120
should cue and that does work but one of

410
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
our chemists at one point put in a

411
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
molecule that he had worked on for his

412
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,820
master's thesis and it maxed out every

413
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,060
core for a full 12 minutes so if you're

414
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,259
one of those people who likes to stress

415
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,199
test just like wait a day please

416
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,160
um

417
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,620
so it'll crawl through all the history

418
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,720
of all the chemical literature and look

419
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,880
for things related to your compound

420
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,040
it can then go combinatorially and try

421
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,540
and figure out the bits and pieces of

422
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,519
way to get from A to B

423
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
if that's not there you can utilize

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,420
another module and it will actually

425
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,399
hypothesize

426
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,160
and the coolest thing that I love so

427
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,740
much is that you can just cut and paste

428
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,199
a Smiles code so a Smiles code is an

429
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,259
alphanumeric string like an ASCII string

430
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,199
that uniquely identifies a molecule if

431
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
you pick your favorite molecule off of

432
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,300
Wikipedia and then you scroll down in

433
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,980
that rightmost column down at the bottom

434
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,420
there'll be a thing that says show

435
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,699
Smiles you click that and that'll pop up

436
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,579
and you can copy paste it in

437
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,320
and again this is right here and I will

438
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,899
show it in just a minute but then

439
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,259
this one I really love there's actually

440
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,800
a system to help you through

441
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,380
it actually can get into each of the

442
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,320
pieces of software and help you work

443
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,800
through it

444
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
I'm a fan uh I love what our vehicle did

445
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,079
with this so

446
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,820
um let's switch over and we'll take a

447
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,099
quick look here so this is what Vinnie

448
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,599
looks like

449
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,240
um In the Flesh as it were

450
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,099
so

451
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,079
here you're seeing the interface and

452
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,919
there's Vinnie up there and saying hello

453
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:17,520
um

454
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,799
Vinnies with a single I at the end just

455
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,199
you know there you go yeah

456
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,240
um and you can go through and this will

457
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,819
allow you to interface with any of these

458
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,220
modules that I just described here you

459
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,020
can see new compound Smiles you can

460
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,419
literally just cut and paste there

461
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,820
and then you can work through and build

462
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,880
yourself a recipe

463
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,340
from here so here um and this one I

464
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,840
think is pre-loaded

465
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,100
I click this here

466
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,460
there we go

467
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,559
and this is what it looks like so again

468
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,480
we couldn't make one on the Fly I really

469
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,299
wanted to but this is what it will look

470
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,100
like once you do this and you can go

471
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,620
through and each of this is a total

472
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,000
graphical user interface you click on

473
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
things and you can change and it will

474
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,840
give you options for which things you

475
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
want to do and if you need a branching

476
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,539
or looping in the structure

477
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,960
and then it'll output a file and that

478
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,580
file you can then load on the microlab

479
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,320
and you can just run it

480
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,179
which uh

481
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,640
I think is amazing and I'm just so

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,780
pleased with everybody who's been

483
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,059
working on this and again this is

484
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,640
um you can see this here it is live you

485
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
can go and play with it right now if you

486
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,880
want

487
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
um I'm just going to go back one and

488
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,500
then show the other angle of this

489
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,320
assuming everybody hasn't overwhelmed it

490
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,159
can I go back

491
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,760
Maybe

492
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,980
uh

493
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,200
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna cheat here

494
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,539
um this will take a moment to load but

495
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,100
here's camhactica this is so much fun

496
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,939
so from here

497
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,919
it has a number of tools and I can't

498
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,320
even get through all of them but these

499
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,000
allow you to not just try and develop a

500
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,220
pathway for synthesizing a molecule you

501
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,740
can also set parameters if you want the

502
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,280
precursors to be commercially available

503
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,160
uncontrolled below a certain price uh

504
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,200
non-toxic in certain categories you can

505
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,260
do that also it will allow you to again

506
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,840
it will hypothesize if you let it it'll

507
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,900
make some good guesses and it will say

508
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
or what you're looking for so again this

509
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,179
is uh

510
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,100
this is where you would probably start

511
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,039
and what you can do

512
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,340
is right here where it says Target

513
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,360
you can just paste in uh the smiles code

514
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,960
for a molecule so I'm gonna try and do

515
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,020
this we'll see if this works whoops

516
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,158
um

517
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,260
here we go so we'll just pick

518
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,179
we'll pick a drug

519
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,240
um

520
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
did I spell it right

521
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,559
I think it's I mean I mean

522
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,500
there we go medication chlorphosamine

523
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,260
all right so there you can see on the

524
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,000
upper right is

525
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
the chemical structure

526
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,280
and

527
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,500
down here

528
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Smiles you click show and here's this

529
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,880
alphanumeric string I'm just going to

530
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,679
grab it

531
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,679
and

532
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,080
what operating system am I writing okay

533
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,700
and then go back over

534
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,860
and hopefully I can paste this in

535
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,280
and

536
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,900
when you click One Step what it looks

537
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,880
for is one pot shots where you can

538
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,460
literally do a single reaction

539
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,320
and get it to work all right there we go

540
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,780
so we've got three options already

541
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,240
so here you can see they're color coded

542
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,400
I haven't done this molecule before so

543
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,740
we're just we're just playing but here

544
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,320
the green one indicates that this

545
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,659
already exists in the literature

546
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:23,159
the blue one indicates that it exists in

547
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,960
the literature but not directly

548
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
and the red one suggests that this

549
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,980
pathway does exist but the precursors

550
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,960
are not commercially available this is

551
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,880
one of my coolest uh one of my favorite

552
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,340
features here is you double click this

553
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,340
and you click say expand node

554
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,679
and what it'll do is it'll run the same

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,159
thing on that one

556
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,679
and it's doing this in real time okay so

557
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,960
this is a server that's in a

558
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,299
secure undisclosed location that is

559
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,220
taking care of this and as you can see

560
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,780
it's like it's thinking this takes a

561
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,980
little time for it to draw out

562
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,480
everything and figure out how this works

563
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,039
and you can continue to iterate this

564
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,600
process

565
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,840
and utilizing this you actually have a

566
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,000
pathway from

567
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,460
oh I have something that I want to make

568
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,340
through to how do I get from point A to

569
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,539
point B

570
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,840
and then how do I make a file that will

571
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,059
then run on the hardware and you can

572
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,020
actually make it

573
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
I'm pretty thrilled

574
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,700
so again massive hats off to all of our

575
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,140
developers who came up with all this

576
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,200
stuff it is so so fun

577
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,700
um and it's fun just to mess around with

578
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,400
too so again uh if you're excited like

579
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,480
yes please use it but just give us

580
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,760
give me another 35 minutes okay so it

581
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,320
doesn't crash

582
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,340
um all right

583
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,480
so

584
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,940
um Vinnie here has some functionality

585
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,299
but we're like to give him a little more

586
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,220
did I press uh

587
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,919
come on

588
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,179
um

589
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,360
right now one of the things that we are

590
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,760
trying to build into Vinnie is the

591
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,320
ability to help you through the research

592
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,120
process

593
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,020
um

594
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,760
doing doing research where you

595
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,020
um that's beautiful

596
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,780
but not what I was dreaming of

597
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,220
um

598
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,880
yeah there we go okay cool

599
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,940
um

600
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,059
So currently Vinnie kind of just helps

601
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,500
you utilize each of the different pieces

602
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,559
of the software it sits in a sort of an

603
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,760
umbrella

604
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,620
um piece of software but these things in

605
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,080
yellow were in the middle of doing and

606
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,760
they're not quite ready yet but again

607
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,799
not everybody is used to reading

608
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,020
scientific literature it's not it's not

609
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,900
super easy so one of these things that

610
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,000
can be done is it crawls through it

611
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,980
looks for things that have code words or

612
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,960
keywords associated with some of the

613
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,179
things that you're trying to search for

614
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:08,880
and it will go through and actually uh

615
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,860
check to see what's out there and it

616
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,799
will give you a crazy a one sentence for

617
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,419
each of the papers and it gives you a

618
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,740
list and each of the ones that look

619
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,059
interesting you can click yes I'd like

620
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,380
to this one and this one and this one

621
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,740
and then it'll go through and um

622
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,200
uh scrape SCI Hub

623
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,020
um our dear friends at scihub

624
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,880
um and it'll zip it up and send them to

625
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,380
you now these yellow ones these are not

626
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,720
live yet but we're working on them

627
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,000
um so again that that helps the the

628
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,580
antecedent process of what drug do I

629
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,500
need or what drug might I want

630
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,340
so

631
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,620
okay

632
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,520
um

633
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,039
this one was not in anybody's request so

634
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,380
there's a little uh lack of overlap here

635
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,179
but

636
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,520
this one was one that we've been working

637
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,340
on for a long time

638
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,240
um

639
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,700
out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest is you

640
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,320
know

641
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
Uncle so-and-so or Aunt so and so just

642
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
slumps over at the dinner table and

643
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,100
what's wrong well you know it's hard to

644
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,080
say because they're just non-responsive

645
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,760
and not breathing and you probably don't

646
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,520
have tools to work with it

647
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,520
probably the biggest magic wand that

648
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,559
exists in critical medicine is the

649
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,299
defibrillator the automatic external

650
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,919
defibrillator it's very simple and

651
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,200
you've all seen it there are two pads

652
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,679
that you stick on and it goes through it

653
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,279
takes an EKG of your heart and

654
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,480
determines if you're in one of these

655
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
states one of these states is either

656
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,760
that things are out of sync or your

657
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,039
valves are just kind of fluttering if

658
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,419
that happens

659
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,880
it will identify that and administer a

660
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,620
shock

661
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,200
if it does that then typically in many

662
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,900
cases the heart will just restart and

663
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,720
you can search YouTube and find just the

664
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,200
most incredible videos of somebody just

665
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,419
grabbing an AED off a wall sticking it

666
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,760
to somebody and a minute later they wake

667
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,039
up and say why am I on the floor like

668
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,679
they're literally okay afterwards unlike

669
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,600
other situations where things are more

670
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,299
critical in these two cases

671
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,000
it just goes away

672
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,740
but

673
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,980
only if you have a defibrillator and you

674
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,900
get it to the person in a short amount

675
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,340
of time you can look at a graph and

676
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,860
there's this these crashing numbers

677
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,260
that if you you know the recovery rate

678
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,240
is very high for short periods of time

679
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,580
and once you get past nine minutes the

680
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,200
likelihood of survival is very very low

681
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,179
and as you get closer to the likelihood

682
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,500
of brain damage is very very high

683
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,640
so the solution is is that everybody

684
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,860
should have one in their car and in

685
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,459
their house

686
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,539
no-brainer right

687
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,600
but there's a glitch

688
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,439
here's the glitch

689
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,000
these are the cheap ones

690
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,600
by the way

691
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,039
so

692
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,260
none of us ever expects that our heart

693
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,320
is just gonna stop or very few people at

694
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,279
least and to Shell out so much money for

695
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,840
something that you think you're unlikely

696
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,799
to ever use is uh is a tall order

697
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,059
so uh how do you fix this well you make

698
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,460
one yourself right

699
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,399
um no problem well it's it's complicated

700
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,299
uh we had this idea a long time ago and

701
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,620
kind of shelved it because it seemed

702
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,000
like it was

703
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,460
uh prohibitively difficult

704
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,899
but luckily we came across a group in

705
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:50,399
Italy who did this in 2017. and we

706
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,539
called them up and said hey can we

707
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,860
partner with you we love what you did

708
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,899
the ubora project is designed as an open

709
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:01,500
medical Hardware platform for deployment

710
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,840
in sub-Saharan Africa and when they

711
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,600
wrote the platform they wanted a test

712
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,700
case and so the test case that they did

713
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,299
was this guy jacobo feretti and he wrote

714
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,120
his master's thesis on designing an open

715
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
source AED and he did a great job it's

716
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,460
amazing it's very thick and it's a fun

717
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,320
read

718
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,980
um

719
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,320
and the entire second chapter is devoted

720
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,380
to the fact that if you wanted to

721
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,240
you could

722
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,460
actually push it through the regulatory

723
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,559
process it meets every regulatory

724
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,380
requirement in North America South

725
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,779
America and the EU and I think there was

726
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,760
a regulatory group in Asia as well I

727
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,620
don't remember which

728
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,140
um but it's this amazing design so we

729
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,059
said hey we'd like to set this up and

730
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,340
just do a new version because they

731
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,960
didn't really deploy it it wasn't out

732
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,100
there it was just sort of a proof of

733
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,320
concept and they let it be

734
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,700
um so

735
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,580
let's see if I can show it to you this

736
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,220
is a Dewalt toolbox and we

737
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,059
decided we just put a sticker on it

738
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,080
and here's the inside

739
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,659
oh sorry the key thing to mention

740
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,820
all the parts all inclusive only cost

741
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,500
six hundred dollars

742
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,120
and somebody and this is not a

743
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,679
beginner's project anybody looking at

744
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,940
this will know this shouldn't be your

745
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,320
first Electronics project if you've

746
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,179
never soldered before but if you know

747
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,860
how to do things and you've you know

748
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,779
you've built a few kits it shouldn't be

749
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,240
that hard also uh I imagine some of you

750
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,039
are noticing the sticker on that giant

751
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,279
capacitor on the upper left there

752
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,120
um

753
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,240
that's that sticker

754
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,320
that sticker is on a 140 microfarad

755
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,399
capacitor rated at 1800 volts

756
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,980
you charge that up to 1600 volts and

757
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,720
that's what actually gives you the shock

758
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,240
that you need so here each of the

759
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,340
different systems

760
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,559
the battery system has two power

761
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,580
supplies one is low voltage to power the

762
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,159
computer and the audio system

763
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,500
and push the square wave the high

764
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,659
voltage charging circuit uh gets power

765
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,279
from a different circuit off the

766
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,200
batteries and that pumps charge into the

767
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,620
capacitor

768
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,260
the relay system is the thing that kicks

769
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,020
it on when it needs to dump either into

770
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,299
a waste resistor or actually into the

771
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,539
pads and the h-bridge system

772
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,120
this is what creates the biphasic shock

773
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,580
when you shock somebody to start their

774
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,440
heart again you have to shock in One

775
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,940
Direction then turn around shock back

776
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,440
the other way so you have to have

777
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,240
something that can do that

778
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,799
halfway through the capacitor

779
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,600
discharging we'll see that in just a

780
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,419
second here so

781
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,340
this is a system on a chip it's a very

782
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,620
sophisticated system

783
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,299
I know some of you understand what all

784
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,720
this means

785
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,539
it's cool and what this does is this um

786
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,179
allows you to load the code that will

787
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,600
take the EKG and it will essentially run

788
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
a finite State machine and decide if a

789
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,960
shock needs to be administered or not

790
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,240
and if not it will also give you audio

791
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,880
prompts it'll tell you to not panic and

792
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,860
to call emergency services and to

793
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,100
continue CPR and to you know do all of

794
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,559
those bits and pieces

795
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,159
um

796
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,380
here's the finite State diagram that

797
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,340
actually

798
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,799
tells you about how each piece goes

799
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,500
around and it measures it will say don't

800
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,960
touch the patient you'll wait

801
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,000
it will do a little Diagnostic and then

802
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,899
it will continue to give you

803
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,880
instructions either to give a shock or

804
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,500
it gives a shock it's a fully automatic

805
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,700
AED it's not the ones where you have to

806
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,380
press the button it'll say stand clear

807
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,700
of the patient don't touch the patient

808
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,919
and then it'll administer the shock or

809
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,380
it will just tell you to continue CPR

810
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,320
or in the case that you don't have

811
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,880
anything wrong it will

812
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,440
tell you that a normal heartbeat is

813
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,960
detective I

814
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,720
we actually have this unit back at our

815
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,480
Airbnb and I really

816
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,000
lobbied the group I said what if we just

817
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,860
stopped my heart and then we could start

818
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,539
it again and they're like that it

819
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,340
doesn't work that way you have to be in

820
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,740
vtac or v-fib and I was like oh right so

821
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,659
how do we induce that and they said no

822
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,659
we're not doing that

823
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:17,399
I thought it would have been fun but

824
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,899
such as it is

825
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,340
um I'm just showing you a graph this is

826
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,840
what a normal heartbeat looks like more

827
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
or less when you plot it in Phase space

828
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,620
now you're used to seeing little things

829
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,899
that blip along so if you do

830
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,120
transformation you can see this pattern

831
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,679
is readily discernible this is the sort

832
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,120
of thing you can teach to a machine very

833
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,799
easily if it sees this this is a normal

834
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,340
heartbeat if it instead sees this this

835
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,200
means things are bad news

836
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,799
and so the way that the algorithm works

837
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,899
is that it will sweep out the internal

838
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:49,140
area created by these curves and if it's

839
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,600
above a certain threshold then it knows

840
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,940
that it's in this mode and says it needs

841
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,380
a shock

842
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,480
um there's this is the one for

843
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,019
I believe ventricular

844
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,399
tachycardia the fibrillation looks

845
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,779
slightly different but again these are

846
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,760
things that are easy for a machine to

847
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,679
notice so of course you know when you're

848
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,480
putting your hands uh your life in the

849
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,039
hands of a machine you want to like how

850
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,179
does it know

851
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,279
this is easy for a machine to determine

852
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,159
it's uh it's fairly simple so then here

853
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,260
this is the H bridge that I spoke about

854
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,179
a moment ago in terms of flipping so

855
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,919
this is sort of a what a generic H

856
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,720
Bridge looks like

857
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,419
um RH Bridge right so and this is the

858
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,279
discharge so this is what it looks like

859
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,159
the capacitor up from there and then it

860
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,539
switches over

861
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,279
and dumps the rest going back the other

862
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,840
way

863
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,279
and

864
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,899
yeah

865
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,360
and this is what the actual circuit for

866
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,220
the h-bridge looks like

867
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,600
um that's why you saw it was all those

868
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,240
many modules together because it has to

869
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,220
do this complicated switching and it has

870
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,200
to do it for very very high voltages so

871
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,539
as you can see there are opto isolators

872
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:59,760
and relays and it's uh uh it's all

873
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,559
pretty pretty cool

874
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,940
um again I'm really impressed with

875
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,279
everything that everybody's done

876
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,120
um

877
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,040
so this is

878
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,440
this is kind of the key piece though

879
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,839
I'm sure you saw how tiny those little

880
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,280
batteries are yeah there's an array of

881
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,780
them but how do you get a tiny little

882
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,060
battery to in a very short period of

883
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,119
time push a huge amount of charge into a

884
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,980
very very large capacitor

885
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,899
well um those of you who are familiar

886
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,579
will recognize this as a fairly generic

887
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:28,260
flyback circuit and this is basically

888
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,359
what we run it's slightly more

889
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,560
complicated than this because there's

890
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,480
tuning involved but this is what the

891
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,339
skeleton looks like what you're doing is

892
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,379
you're pumping a square wave into

893
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,879
uh two Gain stages so there are actually

894
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,520
two transistors on the left there one

895
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,500
kicks it up one kicks it up again and

896
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,820
then you run it through flyback

897
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,980
Transformer and you have this diode and

898
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,440
in our case there are actually two or

899
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,859
three depending on which version we did

900
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,900
um that created and the thing charges up

901
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,700
really fast

902
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,900
um I have video of it that I will

903
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,760
eventually post the first time that I

904
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,220
got it to work I was really surprised

905
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,540
because it hadn't been working for a

906
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,280
while and

907
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,320
um and then when I pushed it to dump

908
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,700
into the power resistor the power

909
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,740
resistor exploded

910
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,260
um so and and another time another guy

911
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,960
was testing it and he it is the most

912
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,119
incredible video because his multimeter

913
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,700
actually jumped off the bench because

914
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,020
one of the uh copper traces vaporized it

915
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,060
was it was nuts to watch

916
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,339
um so

917
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,520
that's the AED it it works just the same

918
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,460
as a commercial unit however

919
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,079
we were sitting around thinking and said

920
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,700
okay well it's as good as a commercial

921
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,800
unit how do we make it better what's

922
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,780
better than an AED somebody said well if

923
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,880
you're in the hospital okay well that's

924
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,200
complicated if you're in a hospital

925
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,579
you've got a whole bunch of people

926
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,680
attending to you you call a code you've

927
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,079
got a respiratory therapist you've got a

928
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,400
pharmacist you've got somebody

929
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,980
monitoring your your Airway you've got

930
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,359
somebody who's reading your vitals

931
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,160
you've got somebody with a manual

932
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,099
defibrillator who's making a decision as

933
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,240
to how they're going to run it

934
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,140
these things are difficult when somebody

935
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,240
mentioned the whole problem of diagnosis

936
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,339
diagnosis is probably the most difficult

937
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,099
thing in all of medicine and is often

938
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,119
gotten wrong

939
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,000
diagnosis is very very difficult

940
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,619
but we asked the question of the things

941
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,060
that are done

942
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,460
what can we add in that doesn't require

943
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,180
diagnosis or any special training and

944
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,820
nicely there are two things that you can

945
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,040
do that are fairly easy and the first

946
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,619
one is you can just give a blast of air

947
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,460
now

948
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,140
um this is an off-the-shelf unit

949
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,940
and you'll see it here

950
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,740
this is how big this thing is and you

951
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,720
can throw it in with your AED

952
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,940
it's a Sports Oxygen thing which by the

953
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,859
way is a total scam if you're in an

954
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,720
aerobic State you're running around your

955
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,520
blood's already totally saturated with

956
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,079
oxygen this will do nothing for you

957
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,480
however if you have not been breathing

958
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,579
and your oxygen saturation has been

959
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,920
tanking if somebody's there and the

960
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
first rescue breath that they give you

961
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,220
comes out of this

962
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,579
then it will increase your oxygen

963
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,320
saturation in your blood and make it so

964
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
that when you're doing the chest

965
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,839
compressions more oxygen will get to

966
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,520
your brain and you're less likely to die

967
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,680
while you're waiting for the EMTs to

968
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,140
show up and the brain damage you are

969
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,079
likely to incur will be less

970
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,460
again easy off-the-shelf solution

971
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,680
and then the other thing is that

972
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,040
typically when you're being given CPR in

973
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,460
a hospital they give you vasopressin and

974
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,980
epinephrine these both increase your

975
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,800
blood pressure this supports CPR if your

976
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,180
blood pressure is low and somebody's

977
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,980
trying to do compressions on you it's

978
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,540
not getting anywhere

979
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,460
it's very very hard so if you can

980
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,560
increase that chemically it's very easy

981
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,599
to do now some of you who are familiar

982
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,800
with this will say well wait a second

983
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
that's an IV how are you going to set up

984
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
an IV well interestingly enough there

985
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,040
was a study shown that intramuscular

986
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,339
epinephrine and intravenous epinephrine

987
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,500
are about the same efficacy when trying

988
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,060
to support CPR

989
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,660
so if you wanted to you could again off

990
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,380
the shelf just throw in three epipens

991
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,420
because you want a full milliliter of

992
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,640
epinephrine

993
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,960
however

994
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,119
there was this problem with epipens does

995
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,160
everybody remember

996
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,400
so you can build your own we've been

997
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,800
doing this for a long time this was like

998
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,660
the big hit a lot of people still kind

999
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,400
of be like oh you're the Epi pencil guy

1000
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,839
I'm like well we have done a few other

1001
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,760
things but yes

1002
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,980
um and we have a few of these

1003
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,839
um is there anybody in the audience who

1004
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:46,279
suffers from anaphylactic shock

1005
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,720
anybody waving nobody

1006
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,859
would you like one

1007
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,220
all right come take this one it's uh so

1008
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,720
again this is an auto injector and it

1009
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,820
has a nice sticker on it and um yeah

1010
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,680
here I'll just pass it back

1011
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,619
um and we probably have one more if

1012
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,020
there's anybody else who's uh wants one

1013
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,839
so in the event that you don't want to

1014
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,359
spend uh

1015
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,599
what is it 650 times three to to put

1016
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,119
three epipens in with your AED you can

1017
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,400
just load this and the benefit is also

1018
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,320
if you're loading it with epinephrine

1019
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,540
you can also load it with vasopressin

1020
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,599
and support CPR even more

1021
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,079
okay

1022
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,800
this is the big one that everybody was

1023
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,200
asking about this is the one that was in

1024
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,680
I don't know very large font in some

1025
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,118
some color

1026
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,359
this one bothers me I mean it bothers

1027
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,099
everybody right but it really bothers me

1028
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,540
from the perspective of Public Health

1029
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,099
because this is

1030
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,960
this has a solution you want to talk

1031
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
about off-the-shelf Solutions things

1032
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
that are totally fixable this is totally

1033
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,540
fixable there's no reason that there

1034
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,880
shouldn't be access to all of the

1035
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,339
reproductive Health in the world

1036
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,740
and most of these things come in pills

1037
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,000
it's so it it's so simple and and and

1038
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,819
shouldn't be an issue that we have to

1039
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,640
talk about or fight for

1040
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,880
um and so let's just um let's just go

1041
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,619
through some of them

1042
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,800
um

1043
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,060
and saying they aren't that hard to get

1044
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,339
it's figurative okay like I understand

1045
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,400
that now in this country it's it is hard

1046
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,220
to get and totally unnecessarily so we

1047
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,079
basically got

1048
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,420
um four categories of ways that we can

1049
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,940
do birth control

1050
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,060
and um three of these come in pills

1051
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,319
right

1052
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,160
um

1053
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,520
at least one form and so first line is

1054
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,099
find again for now like this is still

1055
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,140
legal which is fine

1056
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,240
um and the pills are out there and and

1057
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,980
hopefully you have one that works with

1058
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,380
your body and again but you have to take

1059
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,660
it all the time and you still have to go

1060
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,700
talk to an authority figure who will

1061
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,819
grant you permission to have some uh

1062
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:16,319
autonomy over your body which doesn't

1063
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,540
sit terribly well with me

1064
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,319
um

1065
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,240
and there's this one and this one's in

1066
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,579
this interesting gray area

1067
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,040
um because apparently in certain

1068
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,380
jurisdictions this is not seen as

1069
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,839
different from abortions but it has this

1070
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,819
interesting fact that it's just a single

1071
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,020
pill

1072
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,640
and

1073
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,680
it is technically still over the counter

1074
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,079
now people think about Plan B right

1075
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
that's that's a brand name but there is

1076
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,000
this um

1077
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,400
off-brand called my way

1078
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
that you can get off of Amazon and a

1079
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,740
month ago they were six dollars and now

1080
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,619
they're I think 18.

1081
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,220
um

1082
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,780
but

1083
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,339
this is over the counter you can just

1084
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,260
order it and

1085
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,240
it's um

1086
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,940
still available for now uh interesting

1087
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,060
point of fact it has a three-year shelf

1088
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,440
life

1089
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,640
um

1090
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,380
let me see um could we bring the house

1091
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,359
lights up just a touch so I can kind of

1092
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,819
take a rough count

1093
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:20,520
so let me ask one question

1094
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,200
um who maybe wants one of these for a

1095
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,560
rainy day

1096
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,420
nobody everybody's just cool okay here

1097
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,300
um

1098
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,020
but I was I was looking here and I think

1099
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,119
I think

1100
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,920
oh a bunch of people just filed into the

1101
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,060
back

1102
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,740
I might have enough for everybody

1103
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,859
um interesting point in fact also this

1104
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,579
box is mostly empty it's one pill again

1105
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,160
in a blister pack that of theoretically

1106
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,420
five

1107
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,599
that uh the four are empty because it's

1108
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,420
only a single pill so um

1109
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,700
you know maybe maybe we should just pass

1110
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,579
them around right I mean who who

1111
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,020
wouldn't want this for a rainy day or

1112
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,460
know somebody who might want one for a

1113
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,480
rainy day

1114
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,700
I mean

1115
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,380
here we go I got I got a whole box here

1116
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,819
we go just uh just come up and grab one

1117
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,660
whenever you want

1118
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,560
um

1119
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
and when we were looking at this

1120
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,819
um again we're always thinking how can

1121
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,339
we improve things uh

1122
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,040
looking at emergency contraception is

1123
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,460
probably not the only problem that

1124
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,339
you're dealing with

1125
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,339
um

1126
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,660
wouldn't it be nice to also have

1127
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,160
something that protected against HIV

1128
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,760
well there is post-exposure prophylaxis

1129
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,040
so why couldn't you just bundle them

1130
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,740
well there's a slight problem we looked

1131
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,560
into this and unfortunately there are

1132
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
two problems

1133
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,839
and the which yes

1134
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,420
post-exposure prophylaxis in its like

1135
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,880
regular form if you're a health worker

1136
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,819
and you have a

1137
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:13,619
needle stick problem you go through a

1138
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,020
month of Fairly heavy antiretrovirals

1139
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,839
and then the other problem is that the

1140
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,579
two actually interfere with each other

1141
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,440
if you look if you took one of these

1142
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,480
boxes you'll see on the back that it

1143
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,220
says if you're taking antiretrovirals

1144
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,260
for HIV you should talk to your doctor

1145
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,540
before taking it

1146
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,060
okay so those are problems can we fix

1147
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,960
them and the answer is absolutely we can

1148
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,740
and the wonderful things are that whoops

1149
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,079
I apologize for this

1150
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,079
um

1151
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,579
the two things that need fixing uh first

1152
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:48,960
the fact that they interfere with each

1153
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,740
other

1154
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,540
and um

1155
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,060
the other one being that you have to

1156
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,440
take it for a month

1157
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,260
the first dose of the antiretrovirals

1158
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,359
does something like 90 plus percent of

1159
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,579
the work the rest is just to make sure

1160
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,500
so if you want to be really sure then

1161
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,000
yes you need to dose yourself for an

1162
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,740
entire month and again it's all a

1163
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,260
numbers game both of these medications

1164
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,319
just reduce the likelihood that these

1165
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,760
things will go wrong they don't

1166
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,780
guarantee it at all

1167
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,200
and wonderfully enough there was a

1168
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,099
symposium last year that showed that if

1169
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,859
you just double the dose of the plan b

1170
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,900
you can take it with an antiretroviral

1171
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,460
and it will still be effective

1172
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,020
so

1173
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,060
if you were to say

1174
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,720
bundle those two like

1175
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,040
this

1176
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,160
where you have two Plan B and

1177
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,599
antiretroviral and a little baggie

1178
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,800
that's sealed

1179
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,420
I seal these myself

1180
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,680
last night

1181
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,720
this is what we call Plan B plus and

1182
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,880
again it doesn't guarantee anything but

1183
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,500
it does make these sorts of things less

1184
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,400
likely

1185
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,260
because if you're worried about

1186
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,940
potentially

1187
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,920
getting pregnant you may also be worried

1188
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
about Contracting HIV so

1189
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,020
who wants one of these wait again how

1190
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,800
many people are out there

1191
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,560
because

1192
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,618
because I got a lot

1193
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,980
so um yeah I don't have like things like

1194
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,140
dull these out with but like there's

1195
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,680
hang on I've got a lot like I've got

1196
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,599
hang on how many how many do I have I

1197
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,640
didn't right here there's how many does

1198
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,800
this theater hold because I'm wondering

1199
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,300
I think

1200
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,099
because I think that there's a

1201
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,900
a hundred here

1202
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,599
maybe maybe just shy of a hundred we've

1203
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,920
got a lot

1204
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,420
um I'm just gonna throw more on the

1205
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,920
floor and if people want to come up and

1206
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,200
get more here we go there you go thank

1207
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,940
you sir

1208
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,200
um yeah there are more to be had

1209
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,380
um so that particular antiretroviral is

1210
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,619
I'm going to butcher the uh the

1211
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,780
technical names but it's Truvada

1212
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,000
so it's a single pill of Truvada that's

1213
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,060
filled in with the two Plan B pills

1214
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,839
um

1215
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,900
so again uh hopefully nobody will need

1216
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,940
it but again there they are if you do

1217
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,020
need them

1218
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,359
and again the the reason this bothers me

1219
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,819
is because this shouldn't be a problem

1220
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,960
you know this should be available

1221
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,040
um so then let's let's go to the next

1222
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,720
right

1223
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,640
medicated abortion this is the thing

1224
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,500
that like all abortion activists know

1225
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,280
about

1226
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,960
you have Memphis Stone you have Mr

1227
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,579
Bristol

1228
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,099
um Mr Bristol works on its own very

1229
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,200
effectively you take three doses of it

1230
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,079
it's pretty simple but again it's very

1231
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,680
hard to get

1232
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:47,880
um

1233
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,880
so how do you solve this problem well

1234
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,700
it's it's uh it's it's not that hard to

1235
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,780
solve

1236
00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:00,000
all we do is we just go and buy a bunch

1237
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,780
so you need to take 800 micrograms in

1238
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,240
three Doses and you space them out and

1239
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,640
these are these are made you know you

1240
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,559
can you can buy them from India they're

1241
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,880
not hard to get

1242
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,940
um

1243
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,680
this should solve the problem and there

1244
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,420
are organizations that distribute these

1245
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,160
we're not one of them I just distribute

1246
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,800
them here because it's fun uh

1247
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,780
right but like it this shouldn't be a

1248
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,640
thing right look this little box of

1249
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,680
pills is your abortion in a box like

1250
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,760
again

1251
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,920
you know I'm not going to say who wants

1252
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,000
this for a rainy day because people

1253
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,260
probably won't want to raise their hand

1254
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,059
but like

1255
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:38,400
how many people are out there

1256
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,099
because uh because I got a lot

1257
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,400
so I'll just leave those there

1258
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,640
um and oh wait wait hang on I put some

1259
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,079
more in baggies because I ran out of

1260
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,900
boxes so there's some more

1261
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,579
and again hopefully nobody's ever gonna

1262
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,220
need these and me giving these out again

1263
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,680
it's it's fun right like I'm I hope

1264
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,660
we're all having as much fun as I am

1265
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,859
doing this

1266
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,540
but

1267
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,819
at four thieves we're not focusing on

1268
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,800
how do we build infrastructure or

1269
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,619
supplant infrastructure that

1270
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,260
already exists we don't want to be a

1271
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,079
gatekeeper any more than

1272
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,720
we see the existing Gatekeepers what

1273
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,400
we'd like to do

1274
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,160
is we'd like to show people

1275
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,380
how to make it themselves and somebody

1276
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,240
was nice enough to mention that we had

1277
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,040
put together a video on how to make them

1278
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,960
yourself there's some fairly simple ways

1279
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,220
that you can make tablets if you have

1280
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,500
misoprostol powder this is this really

1281
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,780
cool little pill press it takes nothing

1282
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,240
more than the powder itself and a hammer

1283
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,859
and a spray bottle and you can make

1284
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,300
these tablets

1285
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,520
but it's a pain

1286
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,020
and you have to make tablets because

1287
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,520
they have to dissolve in your cheek if

1288
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,660
you just swallow them nothing happens

1289
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,240
right they have to dissolve

1290
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,040
so

1291
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,119
is there a better way

1292
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,140
and I'm very excited to show you what

1293
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,920
this better way is

1294
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,020
yeah some of you are putting it together

1295
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,240
so if you have say

1296
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,480
some active ingredient of uh misoprostol

1297
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,160
oh I don't have a glass up here well

1298
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,839
that's all right I should be able to

1299
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,760
show this anyway

1300
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,619
what you can do is just dissolve the

1301
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,059
misopher stall in it one of the big

1302
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,619
problems with making those tablets is

1303
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,660
measuring it 800 micrograms very hard to

1304
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,220
measure even if you have it in a

1305
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,619
buffered tablet okay then have you mixed

1306
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:30,420
it properly is it homogeneous there are

1307
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,559
a whole host of problems that happen

1308
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,559
here and if you get

1309
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,640
you can just dissolve it in um

1310
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,240
spiritus polsky uh 96 I bought this

1311
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,280
yesterday who

1312
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,119
who drinks this

1313
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,220
I have enough for everybody we'll pass

1314
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,240
this around when I'm done

1315
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,119
um so I was hoping to show this uh under

1316
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,980
camera but it seems like we don't have

1317
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,660
one but I can show you a picture of what

1318
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,700
I'm about to do

1319
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,980
um this is a micropipette

1320
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,319
yeah thank you this is a micropipet

1321
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,000
which you can see here

1322
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,619
and what you do is if you dissolve the

1323
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,540
misoprostol in here and again this does

1324
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,880
not have Mr Bristol in it currently but

1325
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,740
this is how this would work is that you

1326
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,920
can merely terrible pipetting technique

1327
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,740
um you drop the liquid and then you can

1328
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,480
set how much liquid goes in and then if

1329
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,839
you have say a piece of cardstock

1330
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,680
then all you can do is dropper it on

1331
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,559
the way you would if you were making say

1332
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:38,059
I don't know what else goes on paper

1333
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,760
and this is all it takes and um and I'm

1334
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,200
doing this incorrectly so those of you

1335
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,460
who actually know how to use pipettes

1336
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,319
are probably totally disgusted but

1337
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,059
there's a you would crank this down to

1338
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:49,740
10 microliters and then you put a little

1339
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,839
dose on each of the

1340
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,400
dump that

1341
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,359
um

1342
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,839
on six little spots on a piece of paper

1343
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,180
and you have something that's now no

1344
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,859
longer a tablet and this is great

1345
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:03,540
because it can't be crushed

1346
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,740
it can be sent through the mail and

1347
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,180
detected

1348
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,040
and you don't have to deal with hey what

1349
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,359
are you carrying around what are these

1350
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,500
pills

1351
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,440
and you can hide it in plain view

1352
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,420
and

1353
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,819
if you look these are what the cards

1354
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:21,440
that I just dosed look like

1355
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,700
and here's

1356
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,280
one up close

1357
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,980
and you can take this business card

1358
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,260
and you can cut it into six

1359
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,000
and you tuck the first two on your

1360
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,760
cheeks and that's your first dose

1361
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,920
and you wait and you can do the second

1362
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,940
thing

1363
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,300
the hours later and then the third thing

1364
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,160
and all you need to do and if you do you

1365
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,240
want how many of these do you want to

1366
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,920
make you can make hundreds you can make

1367
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,800
thousands and it's it's just as easy as

1368
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,720
dissolving the powder in the solvent and

1369
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,819
then dosing it out

1370
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,579
and I'm really hoping that this

1371
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:00,180
Revelation is going to make some of us

1372
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,640
be able to say to

1373
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,420
a certain nine people that I won't name

1374
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,059
yeah it's just like

1375
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,319
your opinion man

1376
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,920
so of these Unfortunately today I don't

1377
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,440
have enough for everybody but

1378
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,079
I do have a few of these cards and on

1379
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,300
the front you will see this it says this

1380
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,880
card is an abortion as a QR code where

1381
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,160
you take you to our website just shows

1382
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,740
you how to take it and then on the back

1383
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,099
uh is this so I'll leave these here for

1384
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,900
now instead of just throwing them but if

1385
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,819
anybody wants one

1386
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:40,740
we will also have instructions so that

1387
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,020
if you want to make

1388
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,720
a bunch you can

1389
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,380
and how much would you want to make

1390
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,900
well let's just play with some numbers

1391
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,760
shall we

1392
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,800
so there are about 6.1 million

1393
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,180
pregnancies in the U.S annually

1394
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,339
according to the good mocker Institute

1395
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,000
18 of those are unwanted

1396
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,040
if we just do a little bit of arithmetic

1397
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,740
here we'll see this is a 1.1 million

1398
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,220
pregnancies that are unwanted

1399
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,559
three doses of 800 micrograms that's

1400
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,940
what you get on a card

1401
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,819
you want to multiply this out

1402
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:28,619
this is just a over two and a half kilos

1403
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,720
this means that with just two and a half

1404
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,900
kilos I mean you've seen a kilo just two

1405
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,480
and a half kilos would actually cover

1406
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,079
every single unwanted pregnancy in

1407
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,020
America for the year

1408
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,940
and for those of you who see me do my

1409
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,559
thing I know the question you're asking

1410
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,180
is

1411
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,799
so wear the two and a half kilos

1412
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:55,980
oh I don't know I dropped him somewhere

1413
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,440
but you'll see them out there

1414
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,180

1415
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,700

1416
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,520
conversations with everybody

1417
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,940

1418
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,880

1419
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,359
