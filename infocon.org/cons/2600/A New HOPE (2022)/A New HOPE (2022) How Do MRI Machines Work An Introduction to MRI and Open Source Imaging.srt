1
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,120
okay

2
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,760
foreign

3
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,220
hello everyone welcome to the next talk

4
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,840
today I hope you're having a good day so

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,420
far I've seen some interesting talks

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,040
right just a couple things remember to

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,740
stay hydrated uh be sure to keep your

8
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,180
mask on we appreciate you wearing them

9
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,799
all the time and it makes it much easier

10
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,619
for all of us and uh you know thank you

11
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,080
from the conference itself for that

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,900
uh we have a fourth track you've

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,040
probably seen it floating around

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,180
somewhere if you're interested in giving

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,680
a talk or presentation and you aren't

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,119
scheduled for one you can go to the info

17
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,979
desk and you can ask and there's some

18
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,540
slots in the coffee shop coffee house

19
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,979
where you can go and give you know 15 or

20
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,899
20 minute presentation so after after

21
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,159
seeing all these wonderful presentations

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,200
you feel inspired head down there and

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,460
sign up we'd love to hear what you have

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,420
to say

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,240
and there is uh hackers Got Talent

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,340
tonight so hopefully some of you have

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,780
some great talent and you're willing to

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,939
go sign up and participate in that so

29
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,000
hope hope to see you there so today's

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,759
talk is about MRI machines and how they

31
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,159
work and our presenter is Doug branter

32
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,799
and with that Doug is uh presenting via

33
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,840
Zoom so you won't see his face today

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,819
you'll see his talk if you have

35
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,959
questions we're going to have a q a

36
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,340
period you're going to submit into the

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,560
Matrix chat for this Channel or you can

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
let me know and I will read them in

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,580
because he can't hear you you in the

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
audience so with that with no further

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,500
Ado off to Doug

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,599
um hi my name is Doug brantner

43
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,920
um and this is how does an MRI machine

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,300
work

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,160
um

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,660
so just a quick warning we're going to

47
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,920
see some medical images we're going to

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,420
talk about health and diseases and talk

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,099
about hospital and medical equipment but

50
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,599
nothing too graphic it should be safe

51
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,099
for all ages

52
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,420
um I might talk fast because I have a

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,860
lot to cover

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,300
um I have no personal financial interest

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,220
to disclose related to this talk that's

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,300
something they make you say before

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
medical conferences and the views in

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,200
this talk do not represent those of my

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
employer or the open source Imaging

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,920
project most of this talk is disclaimers

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,260
I am not a doctor I'm not an MRI

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,300
technician or an MRI safety expert or a

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,280
medical physicist if you have any

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,260
questions related related to health or

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,659
interventions I cannot answer those so

66
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,000
you should seek a licensed doctor or a

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
medical technician or all of the above

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
um because I've only been doing this for

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,140
two years and I'm not there yet

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,200
um so I am an MRI research engineer I

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,319
work on sensors for motion correction

72
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,480
and motion Phantoms Phantom is any test

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,459
object that is not a person that you put

74
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,340
in the MRI for testing and I also work

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,640
on uh simulations and body models I have

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,500
a master's in scientific Computing which

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,900
is half math and computer science

78
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,940
um I'd like to say I have a master's

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,280
degree in floating Point errors I did my

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,379
thesis in computer vision this is

81
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,140
solving stereo distances from stereo

82
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,060
images and a little bit of machine

83
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,120
learning I went back to school I used to

84
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,099
work on movies this is where I used to

85
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,340
work this is my office this is the view

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,580
from my office I was in this one and

87
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,959
this is the first science lab that I

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
ever worked on if anyone recognizes that

89
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,640
and I've been a hope volunteer since

90
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,920
2010 shout out to the AV crew and the

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,420
streaming crew

92
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,340
um sorry I can't be there this year

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,239
um

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
uh it's a little bit uh quick thank yous

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,339
um thanks to Hope in 2600 um there was a

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,798
talk at my first hope in 2010 call uh on

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,540
hacking the education system and that

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,340
kind of put the bug in my head to go

99
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,780
back to school

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,860
um and none of this would have happened

101
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,300
without like the open source community

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
and the hacker Community

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
um and uh double thank you to the

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,900
Adafruit uh jobs board uh for uh finding

105
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,880
my last two jobs for me

106
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,540
um

107
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,639
so I'm just going to leave these up here

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,139
I don't think I have enough time to go

109
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,120
into them but a little bit on back to

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,440
school you can go back and pause the

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,419
video if you're interested

112
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,740
um

113
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,400
uh

114
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,919
uh um so I work on motion sensors for

115
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:53,940
MRI

116
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,740
um because motion and MRI is a huge

117
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,780
problem and it causes all kinds of uh

118
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,060
artifacts and images or just messes up

119
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,380
the images

120
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,300
um anything from bulk motion of your

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,820
body uh to respiratory motion from

122
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
breathing or even your heartbeat can

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,180
mess it up

124
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,500
um and basically there's not much you

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,419
can do about it except for repeating the

126
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,520
scan and MRI is pretty slow so it takes

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,380
a lot of time so that is not an ideal

128
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,960
solution there's a lot of effort going

129
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
into motion correction and the current

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,160
methods there's like One sensor where

131
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,340
they put a Pneumatic belt around you and

132
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,380
it's supposed to help with what they

133
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,780
call respiratory gating but it doesn't

134
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,699
work very well and it's very cumbersome

135
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,520
so we're looking for better Solutions

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,580
um so this is a poster we submitted to

137
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,820
an MRI conference this year this is a 3D

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,300
USB camera that can take videos and we

139
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,160
basically put it in some copper pipe

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,840
with some conductive glass for shielding

141
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,419
and stuck it in the MRI and we were able

142
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,940
to get a respiratory motion this you

143
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,680
have to be very careful because of the

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,900
magnet there's a lot of safety testing

145
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
that happens before this so don't try

146
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,520
this at home and one thing that's kind

147
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,039
of interesting is that the MRI the the

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,100
magnetic field increases very quickly as

149
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,280
you approach the MRI and if you move any

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,500
conductive object obviously you can't

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,440
use any mag any metal or magnetic

152
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,000
objects so we use copper because it's

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
not magnetic

154
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,680
um but if you move any conductor it

155
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,060
induces the current and you can burn

156
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,039
things out just by moving around in the

157
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,620
MRI room so one of the cameras actually

158
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,419
burned out just from moving it into the

159
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,100
MRI too quickly so you have to be really

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,500
careful another cool thing about MRI

161
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,900
these are headphones for hearing

162
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,220
protection and you'll see there's an air

163
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,340
tube so they pipe the sound in using an

164
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,259
air tube because you want to avoid

165
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,300
conductors in the MRI if at all possible

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
because they can heat up and cause Burns

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,160
if they're not handled properly so we

168
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,900
want to show that our sensors don't

169
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,960
interfere with the MRI so SNR or signal

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,919
to noise ratio is a huge factor in MRI

171
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,180
and we want to make sure that we're not

172
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,280
negatively affecting the SNR of the

173
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,680
scanner and we show before and after

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,699
without the camera and with the camera

175
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,280
and it's pretty comparable and the MRI

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,759
signal is entirely uh radio frequency so

177
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,720
we want to make sure that we're not

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,520
causing any RF interference in the

179
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,620
standard too so this is the Baseline it

180
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,960
has a funny shape but that's normal and

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,919
this is

182
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
um with the camera operating and you see

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,860
a spike in the noise frequency in one or

184
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,160
two frequencies but typically the MRI

185
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,220
only cares about the center so these you

186
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,380
know may or may or may not be tolerable

187
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,720
depending on the type of Imaging you're

188
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,759
doing and you know we could definitely

189
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,460
improve the shielding as well so this is

190
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,800
the respiratory waveform I think if this

191
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,099
is a video yeah so this is a video of

192
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,780
someone in the scanner breathing and you

193
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,099
can see we can track the motion quite

194
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,599
nicely

195
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,919
um it's also kind of interesting you can

196
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,080
see the buttons in their shirt

197
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,879
um it's uh the buttons actually go the

198
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,259
wrong way though uh probably due to

199
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,759
diffraction um so that's something that

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,740
we should look into further but this is

201
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,479
a pretty promising uh for motion

202
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,039
tracking and this you know we could

203
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,780
either feed the signal into the scanner

204
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,180
uh and do real-time motion correction or

205
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
you can do retrospective motion

206
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,699
correction

207
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,620
um and post-processing

208
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,280
um so uh last year the year before

209
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
um this is my colleague's work

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,060
um we use an accelerometer this might

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,860
look familiar to some people we use an

212
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,419
accelerometer which measures

213
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,639
acceleration and we use that as a proxy

214
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,620
for motion and then we use the wireless

215
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,979
motion uh microcontroller and we found a

216
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,200
non-magnetic battery so we could

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,380
transmit uh real-time motion signals to

218
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,539
a Raspberry Pi over Wi-Fi so this one's

219
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,399
also Wireless which is kind of cool and

220
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,320
that's really important again because of

221
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,399
the heating and wire uh wires can cause

222
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,720
Heating and cause Burns if you're not

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
careful so Wireless is really ideal and

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,459
we have to do a lot of magnetic safety

225
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,899
testing so we have to test each part

226
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,580
individually before we even go in the

227
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,740
room with it to make sure it's not

228
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,300
magnetic so even though this has this

229
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,980
big metal chunk here

230
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,560
um it's it's it seems to be not magnetic

231
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,540
so we were able to use it in the scanner

232
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,640
safely but we also have to do heating

233
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
testing with the RF and make sure that

234
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,519
nothing's going to heat up and cause

235
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,560
Burns

236
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
so we also want to make sure that we're

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,100
not going to mess up the images so this

238
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,860
is a B zero map or a map of the magnetic

239
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,360
field that the scanner can take itself

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,640
and this one is pretty clean so you want

241
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,800
it to be as even as possible and this is

242
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,899
a water bottle Phantom so it um because

243
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,560
most MRI imaging is water

244
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
and we put the different test objects on

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,580
top of it and we see how much they mess

246
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,200
up the magnetic field so even if they're

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,060
not going to fly into the scanner they

248
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,180
can still disrupt the uh the the

249
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,040
homogeneity of the magnetic field so

250
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,080
this one is pretty clean these are two

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,779
different accelerometers and this one uh

252
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,880
causes a disturbance in the magnetic

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,500
field so it might have you know maybe

254
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,899
the the coating on the PCB might have

255
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,399
like nickel or something in it so it's

256
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,200
not enough to fly into the magnet but it

257
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,959
is enough to disturb the magnetic field

258
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,800
and here we show two different

259
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
microcontrollers and they both you know

260
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,120
probably because of this big metal piece

261
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,920
um they this one takes a pretty big

262
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
chunk out of the magnetic field and we

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,700
can't even get an image there so I think

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,740
we wound up I forget which one we used

265
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,200
but probably this one and then two

266
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,360
different batteries again they're both

267
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,100
not magnetic but this one you know

268
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,720
really messes up a magnetic field and

269
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,579
this one doesn't and again we look at

270
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,800
the RF noise too

271
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,320
um so in order to test them we want to

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,459
make sure that the MRI is not

273
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,019
interfering with our sensors and we're

274
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,060
actually getting good signals uh that

275
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,399
they're that are actually useful

276
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,980
um so I worked on a motion Phantom uh

277
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,480
which is basically

278
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,720
um a stepper motor controller using an

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,959
Arduino that drove a cam to squeeze an

280
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,480
airbag and then we send an air tube

281
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
through so this is the MRI is in a

282
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,579
faraday gauge and we have to be very

283
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,339
careful passing anything through what we

284
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,380
call a wave guide which is basically a

285
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,839
pipe that goes through the cage and this

286
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,459
is the block RF noise from the outside

287
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,100
world from interfering with the MRI so

288
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,500
we pass an air tube which is uh totally

289
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
safe and so everything in the MRI room

290
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,940
is rubber from the motion Phantom and

291
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,980
then we put the sensor box on top of it

292
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,560
and it transmits the motion data over

293
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,839
Wi-Fi to a Raspberry Pi that just barely

294
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,420
fit in there and since the Wi-Fi signal

295
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,899
is so far out of our MRI frequency range

296
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,060
um that it it doesn't really affect the

297
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,500
image but we might have gotten some low

298
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,480
harmonics which is interesting

299
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,420
um so the motor is programmed with a

300
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,160
predescribed waveform and we we can

301
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,380
compare that against the the sensor data

302
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
but then if we our goal is to measure

303
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,300
motion and patience and we can't program

304
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,680
the patients

305
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
um so my idea I guess having a film

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
background was to put a camera so we use

307
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,800
the camera for tracking objects that we

308
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,959
can't program

309
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,300
um and this is a video of that

310
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,339
um so this is a in Vivo scan meaning a

311
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,040
real life person a volunteer

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
um we have to do a lot of safety testing

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,700
the the sensor is in a shielded box uh

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,139
made of copper and we have to do heating

315
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,339
testing to make sure it's not going to

316
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,320
cause Burns and we put it inside a flame

317
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,720
proof pouch anyway just to be safe and

318
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,820
you can see um this is comparing the

319
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
accelerometer signal in blue to the

320
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,200
video signal in Orange

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,660
um so we also tried uh putting the

322
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,760
stepper motor in the MRI room

323
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,060
um that this is uh uh do not try this at

324
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,019
home

325
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,000
um and so we uh it causes an enormous

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,339
amount of radio frequency noise so we

327
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,019
put it in a shielded box that was custom

328
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,120
made by our machinist

329
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,660
um

330
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,700
it has a sliding door so we can put the

331
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,860
motor in and out it has a shielded DB9

332
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,300
connector which we use for the motor

333
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,940
power we wind up replacing a lot of

334
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,740
screws with brass screws and stuff like

335
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,940
that

336
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,300
um and uh it has a wave guide again

337
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,139
which is an open uh uh conduit for the

338
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,300
mechanical output so we could put like a

339
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,240
shaft or a belt or a string through it

340
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,760
um for the um so we can actually get the

341
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,339
motion out of the box

342
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,620
um so yeah do not try this at home this

343
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,420
means it's not safe to use in the MRI

344
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,040
room so do as I say not as I do but the

345
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
magnet is actively shielded so it the

346
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,000
magnetic field actually falls off pretty

347
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,600
quickly so all the way back here there's

348
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,940
almost no magnetic pull on the box but

349
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,339
just to be safe we tied some strings to

350
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,380
it so that it wouldn't slide because the

351
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,600
scanner vibrates while it's on

352
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,540
um so this is like yeah do not try this

353
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,100
at home

354
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,000
um and so this is the Baseline RF noise

355
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,940
again radio frequency

356
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,680
um and then this is what happens with

357
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,139
the old cable which wasn't shielded very

358
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,820
well and it really blows up the noise

359
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,160
really badly so we would not get a good

360
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,740
picture from this signal and then with a

361
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,079
new cable with a double shielded twisted

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,639
pair cable the twisted pair really helps

363
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,060
and messing around with the grounding

364
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,500
um we got it back down to Baseline which

365
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,779
I was like really proud of

366
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,440
um

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,540
and just to make sure it's working we

368
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,699
opened that sliding door and this is

369
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,500
what happened so I think that shows that

370
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,600
the shield was actually working

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,260
um

372
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,779
so this is a picture of the motion

373
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,699
Phantom close-up so the stepper motor

374
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,220
driving a cam the airbag and the air

375
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,079
tube goes into the MRI room and this is

376
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,360
the sensor sitting on top of it this is

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,320
a head coil so the MRI signal is radio

378
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,500
frequency again and so we need antennas

379
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,660
in the MRI to pick it up and so this is

380
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,000
actually full of antennas that would

381
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,940
pick up the signal from a head scan and

382
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,139
I don't know if you can see but this is

383
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,779
the water bottle Phantom inside

384
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,579
um

385
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,860
um here's a video of the airbag working

386
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,600
and the sensor on top of it and this is

387
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
the the signal coming from the sensor uh

388
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,339
over Wi-Fi this is a Wi-Fi antenna

389
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,000
um and then

390
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,040
these are the signals we presented at

391
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,500
the conference this is the same from the

392
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
video

393
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,620
um one thing uh the first thing I ever

394
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,660
did was I put some Legos in the MRI

395
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,339
which was kind of cool

396
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,740
um so I got paid to play with Legos the

397
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,300
motor cannot go in the MRI that would

398
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,180
not be safe um but you know wood brass

399
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,680
screws those are safe you have to be

400
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,079
careful with the cables again this was a

401
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,399
test jig to test a linear encoder

402
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,920
um and I use the rubber bands instead of

403
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,899
Springs and then a string that we could

404
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,820
pull uh that went through the waveguide

405
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,940
so everything is non-conductive except

406
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,160
for the the cables

407
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,980
um so MRI it uses magnets and radio

408
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,500
waves um there is no ionizing radiation

409
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,060
in MRI so X-rays and CT or CAT scans use

410
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,060
radiation and MRI does not so that's one

411
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,040
of the major benefits

412
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,920
um uh we're mostly looking at your water

413
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,380
molecules which are full of hydrogen

414
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,940
protons

415
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,060
um the CAT scan oop I'm sorry

416
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,699
uh uh a CAT scan is actually spinning

417
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,380
around you really fast and it's it

418
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,120
literally spins the X-ray around you

419
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,620
really fast

420
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,779
um to get a 3D picture

421
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,120
um and the MRI instead uses a changing

422
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,860
magnetic fields to get multiple views

423
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,440
and that's how we get 3D views in this

424
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,240
case this is from those multiple radio

425
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,639
coils so they're each sensitive to a

426
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,920
different area and then we combine them

427
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,259
at the end to get a nice picture and

428
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,199
what's called parallel Imaging these are

429
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,139
a few other things so this is um you can

430
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,060
take an MRI picture at any angle

431
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,980
um and they're all cross-sections of the

432
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,480
inside of the body so this is an oblique

433
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,100
slice or a diagonal slice of the heart

434
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,660
so you get uh you can see all four

435
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,540
chambers this is a knee in the sagittal

436
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,360
view or sideways View and this is a

437
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,220
axial view which is looking in the head

438
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,440
foot direction or down the bore of the

439
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,779
scanner and this is like the liver and

440
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,579
the spleen

441
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,980
um and these are some other images here

442
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,880
you can see a meniscal tear these are T2

443
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,040
images and the previous ones were T1 and

444
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,899
we'll get to all that later and then

445
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,819
these are you can by manipulating the

446
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,280
settings on the scanner like you would

447
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,799
with like a manual camera you can get

448
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,059
different you can highlight different

449
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,919
tissues or suppress different tissues so

450
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,199
in this case on the left this is a fat

451
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,819
suppressed image and on the right is a

452
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,520
regular image and you can see the the

453
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,380
subdermal fat but also the bone marrow

454
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,079
gets darker when you turn on the fat

455
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,640
suppression

456
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,020
um this is

457
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,740
I hope you can hear this

458
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm going to scroll through this

459
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,179
actually oh I'm sorry

460
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,000
this was partially a video project

461
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,059
so basically you can scroll through the

462
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,039
slices

463
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,140
and get a 3D view of the body and this

464
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,760
is like how the radiologist would look

465
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,980
at it and you could see like the liver

466
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,380
and the spleen and the kidneys and the

467
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,179
spine and you can see the major blood

468
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,940
vessels which is cool and then you can

469
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,880
take the slices in any direction

470
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,679
um

471
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,539
yeah so

472
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,400
um you can kind of think of it as a 3D

473
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,820
Volume but the pictures are are taken in

474
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,320
one dominant Direction so One Direction

475
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
is always going to look the best

476
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,679
um and you can scroll

477
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,480
um you can also turn them into 3D models

478
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
which is really interesting and we

479
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,720
actually use these um for simulations

480
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,000
for MRI images and this is also a big

481
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,460
Topic in data set anonymization and

482
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,620
patient privacy because if you can do

483
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,320
this you could do it with a face so you

484
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,179
can like scrub all the metadata but you

485
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,919
know there's actually a lot of research

486
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
going on in what's called defacing MRI

487
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,600
images to like completely anonymize the

488
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,820
data set in today's world

489
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,879
um

490
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,720
yeah and you can scroll through them

491
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,299
um so you can select the slices you can

492
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,919
select the orientation of the slices so

493
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,320
this is a diagonal slices taken in the

494
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,360
brain so this is uh 40 slices and

495
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
they're taken one at a time and each

496
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,740
time each each slice takes time to

497
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,320
acquire and that's why motion is such a

498
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,679
big problem so if you if one uh each if

499
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,120
you take one slice and then you move

500
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,740
your head a little bit

501
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,360
um then it's gonna the next lace is not

502
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,260
gonna line up or you're gonna get

503
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,900
blurring or something like that

504
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,120
um this is some covid-19 lung Imaging um

505
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,419
you can see uh some damage in the lungs

506
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,179
um and the bottom is a comparison with

507
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,640
the CAT scan and you can see the MRI has

508
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,919
a lot nicer tissue contrast and the soft

509
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,940
tissues

510
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,160
um and it doesn't expose you to uh the

511
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,260
ionizing radiation so that's a huge

512
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,679
benefit of MRI

513
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,080
fmri is kind of interesting they use uh

514
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,679
oxygen level as a proxy for metabolism

515
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,240
so the the you know are they reading

516
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,559
your thoughts you know there's a lot of

517
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,840
research on that right now and they can

518
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
also do functional MRI of other body

519
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,039
parts like the lungs

520
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,380
um using uh different uh concentrations

521
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,200
of oxygen and on top is healthy lungs

522
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
and you can see the oxygen perfusion is

523
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,100
pretty even throughout the lung and on

524
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
the bottom is people with diseased lungs

525
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,299
and you can see the difference

526
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,020
um

527
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,980
uh Interventional MRI is anything that

528
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,200
um any procedure that's Guided by an MRI

529
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,419
so they might put you in MRI and then um

530
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,400
you know use it for a biopsy or surgery

531
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,159
or uh they use uh MRI to guide radiation

532
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,900
therapy to avoid

533
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,299
um damaging nearby tissues

534
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,220
um low field MRI or lower magnet

535
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,340
strength is a very hot new topic because

536
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,960
it because the magnet is a lower

537
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,280
strength

538
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,140
um it opens up a lot of possibilities

539
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,179
for

540
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,620
um

541
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,280
um

542
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,220
uh uh stuff you can bring into the MRI

543
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,799
room uh safely

544
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
um so MRI is very slow it has a very

545
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
little very limited field of view so you

546
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,500
could get a full body CT in less than a

547
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,280
minute

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,840
um where a full body MRI would probably

549
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,760
take you know maybe an hour and it would

550
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,580
be at least six partial scans very

551
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,740
sensitive to motion any implants or

552
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,840
metal in your body is a hazard

553
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,039
potentially some more modern uh implants

554
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,919
are Mr conditional depending on the

555
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,380
scanner and the settings some tattoos

556
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,260
and makeup pigments actually are contain

557
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,780
a

558
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,640
fairromagnetic particles which can heat

559
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,020
up in the MRI so you have to be careful

560
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,280
with that

561
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,059
um

562
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,820
patient Comfort is not ideal a lot of

563
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,919
people have claustrophobia and the MRI

564
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,740
is not a great place for that I'm kind

565
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,600
of hoping with this talk maybe we can

566
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,860
help alleviate some of that and maybe

567
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,320
it'll be interested in all the technical

568
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,000
stuff that's happening around you

569
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,340
um and help with that a little bit

570
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,020
um and you can't move you have to stay

571
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,760
perfectly still

572
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,080
um and you might even have to hold your

573
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,580
breath for some scans with not not

574
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,919
everybody can do and finally it's very

575
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,020
expensive it's a huge complex

576
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,280
installation you kind of have to build

577
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,039
the building around the MRI and because

578
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,140
of that it's um it has very low

579
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,419
worldwide access I've heard anecdotally

580
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,600
that there's more MRIs in New York City

581
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,840
than there are in some countries and so

582
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,700
it can be very difficult to access and

583
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,260
that's part of what the open source

584
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,320
Imaging project is trying to solve so

585
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,440
quickly your body is mostly water which

586
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,000
contains trillions of protons and the

587
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,460
hydrogen atoms and each proton acts as a

588
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,080
tiny little magnet and they're all

589
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,840
randomly arranged so when we put you

590
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,820
inside the magnet the magnetic field is

591
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,799
extending in along the long axis of the

592
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,799
bore and it causes all the protons to

593
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,580
align and it also causes them to precess

594
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,860
and that is like a gyroscope spinning

595
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,380
around the Earth's gravitational field

596
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,260
so when you apply an external Force the

597
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,020
the magnets start to wobble uh like a

598
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,580
gyroscope

599
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,520
um and that can emit radio signals

600
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,600
because they're tiny little spinning

601
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
charges

602
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,760
um

603
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,620
and but they're all out of phase so

604
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,080
they're not doing anything useful yet so

605
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,179
what we do is we apply a radio frequency

606
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,020
pulse at 90 degrees to the scanner axis

607
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,580
and

608
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,299
um

609
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,539
it tips all the protons 90 degrees and

610
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,220
it also causes them to line up in Phase

611
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,919
so now the signal starts adding up and

612
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,419
then we listen to the signal with the

613
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,000
radio with the RF coils and that's the

614
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
the MRI signal

615
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,399
um

616
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,159
but we still don't have any spatial

617
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,600
information we don't know where the

618
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,400
signal is coming from so we can do

619
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,700
what's called uh NMR or nuclear magnetic

620
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,799
resonance spectroscopy

621
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,179
and we can look at the chemical

622
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,880
composition of the the signal by looking

623
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,039
at the frequency spectrum of the signal

624
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
but we don't have enough information to

625
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
make an image yet because we have no

626
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,659
spatial information and nuclear magnetic

627
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,940
red is a nuclear magnetic resonance

628
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,100
refers to the nucleus of the hydrogen

629
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,039
proton so it's not anything uh

630
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,799
Radioactive and they drop the the word

631
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
nuclear for obvious reasons especially

632
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,820
to differentiate between CT and CAT

633
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,440
scans because there there is no

634
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,960
radiation in MRI

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,760
um so in order to get the spatial

636
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,159
information we add more coils

637
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,840
um which are called gradient coils and a

638
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,659
gradient um just means a slope

639
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,659
um so uh and what they do is they tip

640
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,580
the magnetic field and cause the

641
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,980
magnetic magnetic field to vary in a

642
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,440
known way and this affects the frequency

643
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,039
that the protons will resonate at and by

644
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,559
doing that we could the we can cause a

645
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,380
known frequency dependence on position

646
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,480
because we're varying the spatial

647
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
magnetic field in a known way and that's

648
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,360
how we get spatial information and the

649
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,880
gradients are very fast switching really

650
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,460
high current

651
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,740
electromagnet coils and because of the

652
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,299
the fast switching they cause a

653
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,340
mechanical vibration and the scanners

654
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,260
kind of shaped like a speaker and that's

655
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,260
where the classic MRI sound comes from

656
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,419
um and then finally we acquire the

657
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,000
images in what's called a 48 uh Fourier

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,659
space or k-space or frequency space

659
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,039
um and so the final step is image

660
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,720
reconstruction where we apply a Fourier

661
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,980
transform

662
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,500
um to convert the frequency space to uh

663
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,360
to an image

664
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,700
um how are we doing on time

665
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,620
um so this is some early MRI I would be

666
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,640
remiss because I know there's a lot of

667
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
connections between hope and SUNY Stony

668
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
Brook so uh one of the early Pioneers uh

669
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,659
Paul louderberg won the Nobel Prize

670
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,860
um and if this doesn't look like a

671
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,900
hackerlab to you um I think I think he

672
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,700
also deserves an honorary uh hacker

673
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,900
prize

674
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,659
um and then there was another one

675
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,299
um another guy at Stony Brook who

676
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,260
developed one of the first

677
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,240
superconducting magnets and did the

678
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
first human MRI and this looks

679
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,220
terrifying um we don't wrap you in coils

680
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,320
anymore like that we might lay coils on

681
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,120
top of you but our coils I promise are

682
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,460
much better insulated than that the

683
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,080
magnetic fields were you know very low

684
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,480
field between 500 to 1000 Gauss which is

685
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,340
a measurement of the strength of the

686
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,860
magnetic field and this is the first

687
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,840
human MRI

688
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,059
um 1977 and you can see the lungs the

689
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,400
air doesn't make any signal but you can

690
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,779
kind of see the tissue surrounding the

691
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,000
lungs and this is a year later and they

692
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,980
tried to segment some of the organs um

693
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,659
the stomach and the spleen and the lungs

694
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,880
things and as you can see we've come

695
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,039
quite a long way since then and this one

696
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,480
took four and a half hours to make

697
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,520
because they had to move the the

698
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,860
volunteer

699
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,020
um uh to acquire every single Pixel in

700
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,279
the image because it had a fixed

701
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,659
magnetic field

702
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,880
and it didn't have the gradients so they

703
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,020
actually had to move the subject

704
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,120
throughout the field of view in order to

705
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,100
get uh the image

706
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,380
um so this guy might look familiar to

707
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,260
some of you so we measure modern MRIs

708
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,799
and Tesla which is equal to 10 000 Gauss

709
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,080
so they're quite a bit stronger

710
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,700
um the average junkyard magnet is about

711
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,919
one Tesla and it's you know hundreds of

712
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,299
times stronger than your refrigerator

713
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,100
magnet and tens of thousands of times

714
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,679
the Earth's magnetic field low field is

715
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,179
generally less than one Tesla and high

716
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,159
field is uh seven to twelve Tesla for

717
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,760
human Imaging

718
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,260
um the most common ones are one and a

719
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,360
half or three Tesla and then other

720
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,700
research NMR magnets can go from 20 to

721
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,440
40 Tesla and I think the most powerful

722
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
is a 45 Tesla but those are not for

723
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,179
humans

724
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,380
um so the magnets there's different

725
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,000
shapes these are what are called open

726
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,240
MRIs and they generally tend to be lower

727
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
field strength um and they're not as

728
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
common as the the solenoid or

729
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,480
cylindrical magnet so this is what we're

730
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,460
going to talk about today and this is

731
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,940
the main uh the b0 Axis or the main axis

732
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,340
of the magnetic field is this Arrow so

733
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,659
it's that right down the center of the

734
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,580
scanner or the bore

735
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,899
um

736
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,179
so this is a map of the magnetic field

737
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,980
and how it falls off as you get away

738
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,360
from the magnet and it falls off pretty

739
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,240
quickly because of active shielding

740
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,340
um and you see the red and yellow zones

741
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,020
but those don't matter what matters is

742
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,299
the five Gauss line or the 0.5 Milli

743
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,220
Tesla line which is this dotted line out

744
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,299
here

745
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,679
um and that's what we call the danger

746
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,960
zone and you try to build the building

747
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,480
so that the the five Gauss line is

748
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,799
contained within the room but that

749
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,840
doesn't always happen and again the b0

750
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,419
axis is pointing along the center of the

751
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,460
MRI

752
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,779
um the emerald the magnetic field

753
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,820
extends in three dimensions so it

754
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,140
actually goes above and below the floor

755
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,059
too so you have to be really careful

756
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,260
um and again this is why the whole

757
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,940
building has to be taken to in into

758
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,679
account

759
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,220
um this is an MRI guided surgical Suite

760
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,659
um and they actually painted the floor

761
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,940
so that they they Mark the five Gauss

762
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,779
line

763
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,640
um and so this is the the MRI Danger

764
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,200
Zone in the white zone and then the blue

765
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,059
floor is where it's like safe but I'm

766
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,559
sure anybody that works in here has to

767
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,600
be like very very careful and there's

768
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,740
probably a lot of training that goes

769
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,740
into this so they don't make mistakes

770
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,340
um

771
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,679
so the dangers from the magnet are the

772
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,080
force or the missile effect uh due to

773
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
the magnetic due to the magnetic field

774
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,100
um and that's why you can't bring any uh

775
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,899
ferrous ferrous metal into the room

776
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,880
because it'll just fly into the magnet

777
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,140
um and then there's also a torque so any

778
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,000
elongated objects will try to align

779
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,520
themselves with the magnetic field

780
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,600
um and it can

781
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,059
um it can apply hundreds of times an

782
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,799
object's weight in force so it's it's

783
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
pretty dangerous

784
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,279
um there's also a force due to induce

785
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,659
currents which we talked about with the

786
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,059
camera earlier so even and even if it's

787
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,940
not magnetic any conductive material

788
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,140
will when you're moving it through the

789
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,520
magnetic field will induce a current

790
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,799
which opposes uh creates its own

791
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,299
magnetic field which opposes the force

792
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,779
so it's a very weird uh feeling

793
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,419
um so the magnet is always on

794
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:34,860
um this is what happens if you're not

795
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,620
careful so don't do that

796
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,080
um the that's why they divide the the

797
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,440
building into restricted access zones

798
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,700
and I'm looking at all you pen testers

799
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
right now um do these signs also apply

800
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,500
to you and if if you don't believe that

801
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm sure the magnet will be happy to

802
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,340
confiscate your lock picks for you in a

803
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,320
maybe violent way so you know respect

804
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,760
the signs

805
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,279
um this is a ultrasound cart that they

806
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,840
use for some procedure and they actually

807
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,799
tied it I don't know if you can see

808
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,260
there's a cable here tied to the wall

809
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,940
um so it can't go past this line so

810
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,039
that's kind of interesting

811
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,620
um the MRI is inside a faraday cage

812
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,559
because the the RF signals are uh that

813
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,500
your body emits from your protons are

814
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,960
very very weak so we try to block out as

815
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,080
much external RF noise as possible

816
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,580
including special doors with RF seals

817
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,799
and special glass with a mesh in it

818
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,440
that's also conductive

819
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,980
um

820
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,559
and then uh so how do we get wires in

821
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,480
and out for the sensors

822
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,279
um we either use a patch panel

823
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,419
um and you have to be you have to pay a

824
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,440
lot of attention to grounding and

825
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,000
shielding which might you know pass Life

826
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,740
as a live sound engineer actually

827
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,480
prepared me quite well for

828
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,980
um or you can use the waveguide and pass

829
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,059
things through the waveguide because

830
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,860
this is just a pipe

831
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,500
um ideally uh we always use shielded

832
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,020
cables because of the RF concerns and

833
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,820
ideally you would avoid running them

834
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,960
through the waveguide because the The

835
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,240
Shield can act as an antenna and

836
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,519
transmit RF noise from outside to inside

837
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,100
the room and that's a problem this one I

838
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,260
believe is fiber and fiber is actually

839
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,360
okay because it's it's not metallic at

840
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,179
all so that a lot of uh

841
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,580
commercially available MRI sensors uh

842
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,220
use Fiber but that's like very very

843
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,679
expensive we also have to use cable

844
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,960
traps because the shields can heat up

845
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
um and so the cable trap helps block

846
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,559
What's called Eddy currents that build

847
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,380
up from the RF pulse um and uh block

848
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,899
that from uh causing Heating in the

849
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:28,919
cable but that can actually cause like

850
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,179
serious Burns so that's something that

851
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,320
we have to be really really careful

852
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,760
about

853
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,580
um don't don't be this guy

854
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,200
um so the magnet is actually a

855
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,940
superconductor

856
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,000
um and superconducting means it has zero

857
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,260
resistance

858
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,779
um and they use uh fancy uh wire

859
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,600
filaments that when you get them below a

860
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,220
certain temperature which is very very

861
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,679
low they become super conducting and

862
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,840
they lose their resistance

863
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,000
um the magnet the reason the magnet is

864
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,460
so big is it's actually a giant tank of

865
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,380
liquid helium which is held at for

866
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,260
Kelvin and it's cryogenically cooled

867
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,320
um

868
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,820
and this is uh uh to achieve the

869
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,799
superconducting

870
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,539
um so the it's pretty complicated it's

871
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,299
called a cryostat and it has very uh

872
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,519
elaborate uh thermal shielding

873
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,480
um this is a this is a an an NMR magnet

874
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,980
um which has a very small board it's

875
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,899
just this tube at the top here so this

876
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,519
is for like measuring chemical samples

877
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,840
and stuff

878
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,700
um this one actually has an inner

879
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,380
chamber with liquid nitrogen to keep it

880
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,760
even colder so this one's probably

881
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,260
pretty high field

882
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,880
um but there's like many many layers of

883
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,380
thermal insulation to keep the magnet

884
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,760
cold

885
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,100
um so when you inject the current into

886
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,899
the magnet um you inject the current

887
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,940
once when you when you start the magnet

888
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,220
and then you walk away and there's no

889
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,899
power source and the current just keeps

890
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,480
flowing forever so have we you know

891
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,539
magically discovered perpetual motion

892
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,279
um not quite so there is a very small

893
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,840
resistance and the magnet does actually

894
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,580
get weaker over time but it's a very

895
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,679
very small amount and over the lifespan

896
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,019
of the magnet it's pretty negligible

897
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,700
um and there are there is energy going

898
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,559
into the system uh mostly with the

899
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,600
chilling um you're pumping the liquid

900
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,799
helium

901
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
um so there's electrical energy and heat

902
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,279
energy and you also refill the liquid

903
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,200
helium periodically so I'm sorry there's

904
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,940
no free lunch

905
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,740
um the magnetic field has to be very

906
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,140
very even or what we call b0 uniformity

907
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,659
which is those Maps I showed earlier

908
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,640
um and because the frequency of the RF

909
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,919
single depends on the magnet uh the

910
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,779
strength of the magnet

911
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,299
um so if we just use one big coil we

912
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,220
only get a very small area of

913
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,779
homogeneity in the center and that's not

914
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,700
big enough for Imaging so by using

915
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,399
multiple coils we can expand that range

916
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,740
um into a much wider area and so the the

917
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,299
uh the magnet coils are pretty

918
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,340
complicated designs

919
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,200
um and then we actually add uh

920
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,179
additional superconducting coils called

921
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,399
shim coils that are active and they're

922
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,899
they're automatically adjusted by the

923
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,120
the computer before every scan and that

924
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
helps us get the the homogeneity uh very

925
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,860
even because when you go into the

926
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,019
scanner your protons are interacting

927
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,240
with the magnetic field and so just your

928
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,579
presence uh or any any presence in the

929
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,079
magnet will disrupt the magnetic field

930
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,879
so you have to do the active shimming

931
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,219
before every scan and there's another

932
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,918
set of superconducting coils going in

933
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,960
the opposite direction and those are the

934
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,418
active shielding coils which help block

935
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,879
the magnetic field from uh or it helps

936
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,440
contain the magnetic field to a smaller

937
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,000
area but it has the secondary effect

938
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,379
that the magnetic magnetic field

939
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,179
increases very quickly as you apply

940
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,460
approach the magnet so for what I do we

941
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,020
have to be extremely careful when we're

942
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,699
testing new objects because they could

943
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,820
just fly out of your hand like nothing

944
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,260
so the the magnetic field aligns all

945
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,000
your spins I think I have to go through

946
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
this part pretty quickly it aligns the

947
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,699
spins of all your protons and it causes

948
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,739
them to process like a gyroscope so this

949
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,540
should be spinning

950
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,199
um

951
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,440
and the frequency that they precess at

952
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,800
is called the larmore frequency and it

953
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
depends on the magnetic field strength

954
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,700
and what's called the gyromagnetic ratio

955
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,940
of the particle gamma and all the

956
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,880
particles have different ratios so they

957
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,320
all will resonate at different

958
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,680
frequencies so the larmore frequency we

959
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,540
call that the resonance frequency or the

960
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,980
center frequency of the scanner because

961
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,480
that's where all the RF Equipment is

962
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
tuned to and the frequency is equal to

963
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,339
the gyromagnetic ratio at times the

964
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,500
strength of the magnetic field

965
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,800
um and for hydrogen protons this is the

966
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,140
gyromagnetic ratio and you can see how

967
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,460
the frequency changes at different

968
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,380
scanner strengths and the frequency goes

969
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,960
up with scanner strength generally SNR

970
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,180
tends to go up uh with a magnet shrink

971
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,560
as well

972
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,260
um so this is the NMR spectroscopy this

973
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,700
is a frequency spectrum and you can see

974
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,940
how different molecules uh resonate at

975
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,140
different frequencies and you can look

976
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,720
at the chemical composition of your

977
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,400
sample

978
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
um and one cool application of that is

979
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,460
to detect counterfeit olive oil

980
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,560
um so

981
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,579
um

982
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,980
uh

983
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,200
so what we do is we hit the the protons

984
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,400
with a RF false uh which is uh also has

985
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,839
a magnetic component and we call that

986
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,700
the B1 field

987
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,280
um uh and it's actually because it's an

988
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,839
oscillating radio signal it's rotating

989
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,520
around the scanner at the same frequency

990
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,920
as the protons are precessing

991
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,300
um and it's always at 90 degrees

992
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,119
rotating and it knocks the protons 90

993
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
degrees uh

994
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,460
um away from the b0 axis and now they

995
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,859
start emitting radio signals

996
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,440
um and then

997
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,099
um

998
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,619
it also lines them all up in phase and

999
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,700
that's how we get the signal because

1000
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,900
otherwise they would be all randomly

1001
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,060
aligned and we wouldn't get anything and

1002
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,220
this is what the signal looks like so as

1003
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,320
soon as you turn the RF pulse off

1004
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,839
um you get uh the signal starts to Decay

1005
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,460
so you can see it oscillating at the

1006
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,599
larger more frequency and then it's

1007
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,180
decaying back towards alignment with the

1008
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,480
b0 field and this is what we call a T2

1009
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
effect I'm sorry this is what we call a

1010
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,640
T1 effect and then a T2 effect is the

1011
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,740
defasing of the protons also causes the

1012
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,440
signal to Decay and this follows What's

1013
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,680
called the block equations which are T1

1014
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,079
and T2 are the relaxant relaxation time

1015
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,880
constants and those go into exponential

1016
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
functions

1017
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,800
um and so T1 is how quickly it realigns

1018
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,900
with the the b0 field and T2 is how fast

1019
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,240
the protons D phase and T1 is a lot

1020
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,280
faster than T2 and we can adjust the

1021
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,020
scanner parameters um to get different

1022
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,599
tissue contrast because um T1 and T2 are

1023
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,520
fundamental properties of the different

1024
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,480
molecules just like mass or density

1025
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,400
um so we have all kinds of different RF

1026
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,839
coils

1027
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,380
um and uh uh today's Imaging is a lot of

1028
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,060
parallel Imaging so we might have 12

1029
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,880
coils or you know 64 coils and one uh

1030
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,500
what we call head coil and we want to

1031
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,660
get the coils as close as possible so

1032
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,280
that because the signal is very weak

1033
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,320
that is coming from your body so they

1034
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,640
might instead of wrapping a coil around

1035
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,140
you they might lay it on top of you like

1036
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,720
this and the straps are just to keep the

1037
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,520
coil from shifting during the scan so

1038
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,920
that's not nothing to be afraid of

1039
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,540
um and there's a lot of research coils

1040
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,220
and they can be as simple as a wire Loop

1041
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,040
or they can be like fairly complex this

1042
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,520
is for multi-nuclear Imaging or it can

1043
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,560
be uh tuned the tuning can be adjusted

1044
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,780
to different molecules so it's not just

1045
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,540
hydrogen protons there's also flexible

1046
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,579
coil so if you have pain in your wrist

1047
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,619
but it only hurts when you flex your

1048
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,560
wrist maybe we can see why but we can't

1049
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,720
do that with a rigid coil so a lot of

1050
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,400
people are working on flexible coils so

1051
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,020
you can get images in both positions and

1052
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,640
see the difference

1053
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,240
um

1054
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,180
this is kind of cool it's a opencv hack

1055
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,180
to use a QR code to track RF probe and

1056
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,480
you can look at the the field from the

1057
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,579
coil

1058
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:52,619
so the gradient coils for the spatial

1059
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,140
localization are really complicated they

1060
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,400
have these really crazy fingerprint

1061
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,839
shapes

1062
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,060
um they're uh they are not super

1063
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,040
conducting they're electromagnetic coils

1064
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,780
but they are liquid cools because they

1065
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,119
have uh they have very high current and

1066
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,119
uh voltage and they're switching very

1067
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,339
fast so both the coils and the

1068
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,859
amplifiers are liquid cooled and this is

1069
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,599
again where it causes vibration of the

1070
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,520
scanner and that's where the um the MRI

1071
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,460
noise comes from the magnetic gradients

1072
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,040
so the the b0 field and the magnet if

1073
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,300
we're looking along uh that uh one axis

1074
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,640
of the magnet the b0 field is ideally

1075
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,740
very linear and very even

1076
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,180
um and because of the larmore equation

1077
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,640
uh the frequency that the protons are

1078
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,040
processing at should be the same in all

1079
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,180
regions

1080
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,800
um so that's not helpful for creating an

1081
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,420
image because we we can't tell if the

1082
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,280
protons coming from here or from here so

1083
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,320
what we do is we apply a slope to the

1084
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,560
magnetic field and we change by by doing

1085
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,599
that because of the frequency dependence

1086
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,820
now the the Larimore equation has a

1087
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,240
dependence on position so now the

1088
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,400
particles over here are going to process

1089
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,859
at a lower frequency and here they're

1090
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,119
still at the center frequency because

1091
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,980
we're crossing zero and here they're at

1092
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,319
a higher frequency and now we can look

1093
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:08,940
at the frequency spectrum of the RF

1094
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,380
signal and now we have spatial

1095
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,060
localization

1096
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,560
um and that's that's the trick that's

1097
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,140
called frequency encoding

1098
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,660
um and You by doing this we can select a

1099
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,280
slice with one gradient I'm going to go

1100
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,960
through these quickly

1101
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,760
um and we apply different gradients in

1102
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,260
different directions to get the spatial

1103
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,339
localization because we have a

1104
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,900
three-dimensional problem so we have

1105
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,819
three gradients to solve it

1106
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:32,339
um and the um the phase encoding

1107
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,079
gradient uh has to be repeated multiple

1108
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,760
times and that's where we uh manipulate

1109
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,800
the spin the the phase angle of the

1110
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,800
protons to get additional uh spatial

1111
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,660
information but that has to be repeated

1112
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,819
many times to fill up the image and

1113
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:47,460
that's why the MRI takes so long

1114
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,640
um and by adjusting uh the the timing of

1115
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,140
the scanner we can get different image

1116
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,280
contrasts

1117
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,859
um and you can see how uh here

1118
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,780
um these are T1 weighted and T2 weighted

1119
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,859
these are all the same samples so they

1120
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,420
all look the same um this is copper

1121
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,460
sulfate these are Lego uh pieces that

1122
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,980
they machined uh custom-made Lego pieces

1123
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,420
machined as fluid Chambers I thought

1124
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,980
that was really cool

1125
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,160
um and uh here the oil is brighter the

1126
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,660
the copper sulfate and the oil are

1127
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,520
brighter in T1

1128
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,339
um but the the oil uh the the copper

1129
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,859
sulfate doesn't show up at all in T2 but

1130
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,720
the the oil does and then the water is

1131
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,460
brighter than the oil in T2 so by

1132
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,200
adjusting the the image weightings you

1133
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,140
can uh you can get different Imaging

1134
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,760
contrasts which are have different

1135
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,500
diagnostic purposes for the doctor and

1136
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,000
you might do multiple scans you might do

1137
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,720
a T1 and a T2 uh you might do other ones

1138
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,560
um because they each have different

1139
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,480
information

1140
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,220
um I'm gonna skip through a little bit

1141
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,300
of this

1142
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,339
um so we acquired the image in k-space

1143
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,800
which is frequency space and the it's a

1144
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,980
grid like a matrix on a computer or a 2d

1145
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,900
array

1146
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,780
um and we uh acquire the the frequency

1147
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,000
information and we acquire one line at a

1148
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,980
time using the gradients and so that

1149
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,420
this is why it's slow and you have to

1150
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,740
fill up every line and this might be

1151
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,440
like uh 256 by 256 Matrix so we have to

1152
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,140
repeat the pull sequence 256 times to

1153
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,819
get one slice

1154
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,619
um and then we do the inverse Fourier

1155
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,140
transform to convert the frequency space

1156
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,180
which doesn't look like anything to the

1157
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,040
actual image

1158
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,640
um

1159
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,960
and if you're not familiar with the

1160
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,280
Fourier transform if you're familiar

1161
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,900
with sound you can look at the low

1162
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,339
frequencies and the high frequencies

1163
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:26,220
given the time signal of the of the of

1164
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,859
the sound and um you know you can boost

1165
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,240
the bass or you can boost the high

1166
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,740
frequencies

1167
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,859
um but this is the fft right here is uh

1168
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,839
dividing a time or a spatial signal into

1169
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,180
frequencies

1170
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
um

1171
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,420
so uh

1172
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,980
this is what the fully reconstructed

1173
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,240
image looks like most of the information

1174
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,099
is contained in the center of k-space so

1175
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:52,020
if we ignore the outer part of K space I

1176
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,339
don't know if you can see but the rest

1177
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,260
of it is grayed out you get the low

1178
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,579
frequency and now this we're talking

1179
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,140
about spatial frequencies so the the

1180
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,260
black and white uh variations uh uh in

1181
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,640
the image

1182
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,540
um

1183
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,480
if we if we ignore all the uh

1184
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,220
if we only look at the center of K space

1185
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,960
we get a low frequency image which is

1186
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,099
kind of blurry but you see all the

1187
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,900
structures and if we ignore the center

1188
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,700
of K space we lose the structure but we

1189
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,160
get all the high frequency details

1190
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,940
um so access is a big problem in MRI we

1191
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,680
used to talk about portable scanners and

1192
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,140
we what what they meant was a tractor

1193
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,960
tractor trailer with an MRI in the back

1194
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,760
um and this is actually like uh what's

1195
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,160
used in a lot of more rural locations

1196
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,660
um they might have like a truck you know

1197
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,619
pulled up to the side of the hospital

1198
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,540
that's permanently wired in

1199
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,160
um and so what

1200
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,339
um now there's uh more portable magnets

1201
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,839
uh nowadays

1202
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,220
um these this one I'm not sure if it's

1203
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,440
portable or not um but this one is

1204
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,760
portable you can push it around the

1205
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,280
hospital and it has this really funny

1206
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,880
um uh uh uh barrier so you don't get too

1207
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,200
close to it because it has a permanent

1208
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,520
magnet

1209
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,859
um so uh the technology is really

1210
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,720
advancing rapidly

1211
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,520
um but again like MRI is also very

1212
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,560
expensive so this is where open source

1213
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,180
Imaging comes in

1214
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,680
um so it started I don't know exactly

1215
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,819
when it started but one of the earliest

1216
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,560
projects was in 2014 and they were

1217
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,180
trying to build a tabletop educational

1218
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,160
scanner for less than ten thousand

1219
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,060
dollars because you could buy it

1220
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,099
commercially for a lot of money this has

1221
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,740
a one cent meter field of view with 50

1222
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,400
PPM homogeneity and a 0.19 Tesla

1223
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,940
permanent magnet and you might have a

1224
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,640
several of these in a classroom so you

1225
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,740
want to keep the cost down

1226
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,180
um right now the open source Imaging

1227
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,280
project is working on a fully open

1228
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
source MRI that can be used for human

1229
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,780
Imaging on a smaller scale so maybe like

1230
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,700
a limb or a head or something like that

1231
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,560
and they're actually seeking regulatory

1232
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,380
approval right now for human Imaging and

1233
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,960
this is uh what's called a halbach array

1234
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,000
where you use tiny little neodymium

1235
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,980
magnets and you put them in these little

1236
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,119
square slots and this is a CNC machines

1237
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,220
and it creates by by putting all the

1238
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,560
magnets in a very specific Arrangement

1239
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,900
which you need a computer simulation to

1240
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,060
design

1241
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,859
you can get a very homogenous low field

1242
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,960
of magnet so this is like a mini MRI

1243
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,440
scan a magnet and they also added shims

1244
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,500
with sliding trades you can uh fix the

1245
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,079
magnetic field even better

1246
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,940
um this is one of my favorite projects

1247
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,740
on open source Imaging um it's basically

1248
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,079
like uh the same as a 3D printer but

1249
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,240
they put a magnetic Probe on the end

1250
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,619
um so they can measure the homogeneity

1251
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,060
of the magnet

1252
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,740
um and create that b0 map that we saw

1253
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,000
earlier

1254
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,819
um and this this is uh um

1255
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,040
uh do do not try this at home and that's

1256
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,780
as much of a warning for me as it is for

1257
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,280
you because this is where I got that

1258
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,900
idea to try the Snapper motor because I

1259
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,780
was like oh maybe I can put a stepper

1260
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,240
motor in the MRI room um so yeah do not

1261
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,220
try this at home um but yeah it was

1262
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,619
great for ideas for me so you have to be

1263
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,060
extremely careful doing something like

1264
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,500
this they put a really long rod on the

1265
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,900
end because they can't put this close to

1266
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,099
the magnet because it would just it

1267
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,180
would fly in and get stuck and hurt

1268
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,540
someone this is a 3T 3T magnet and this

1269
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,180
is a 7t magnet so this one you have to

1270
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,160
be even more careful in

1271
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,980
um and but it's you know it's it's a

1272
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,540
really cool idea and I never would have

1273
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,920
thought it you know especially being new

1274
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,119
to the field I never would have thought

1275
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,680
it would have been okay to do this but

1276
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,420
as long as you're super careful and you

1277
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,160
have the proper training you know you

1278
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,319
can you know it's pretty interesting

1279
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,240
um what you can do

1280
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,819
um there's all kinds of RF uh amplifiers

1281
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,200
projects on there so there's a lot of

1282
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,760
Hardware projects

1283
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,020
um there's a lot of software projects

1284
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,880
and SDR projects

1285
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,680
um SDR is opening up like all kinds of

1286
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,020
new new possibilities

1287
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,400
um and there's plenty of Open Source

1288
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,500
software on the project too

1289
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,540
um so if you're interested in getting

1290
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,520
involved

1291
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,180
opensourceimaging.org they're always

1292
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,040
looking for help in collaborators

1293
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,940
um and uh there's some great uh talks on

1294
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,839
um uh MRI together conference is uh all

1295
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,220
the talks are available on YouTube and

1296
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,660
there's a really interesting talk from

1297
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,339
the national uh radio astronomy

1298
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,660
Observatory

1299
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,940
um that shows the relation between

1300
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,040
um MRI and radio astronomy and that's

1301
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,380
also really interesting

1302
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,760
um so yeah thank you everyone

1303
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,449
[Applause]

1304
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,760
all right thank you uh if anyone has any

1305
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,800
questions he can't hear you directly but

1306
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,200
I can try and repeat them or we can go

1307
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,760
up to if you want to go to the front mic

1308
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,800
you can speak directly in whichever you

1309
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,099
prefer

1310
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,059
yeah I'll do my best

1311
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,660
without a high B zero homogeneity what

1312
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,300
is lost in the image is the question

1313
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,119
um so going back to the larmore equation

1314
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,980
um we get the spatial information from

1315
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,020
the frequency that the um the protons

1316
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,900
are processing at

1317
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,599
um and so we need the gradients to be

1318
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,220
very linear

1319
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,500
um so that we have a known um oop where

1320
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,819
do we go

1321
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,140
um we need the gradients to be very

1322
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,700
linear because the frequency has a

1323
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,559
direct dependence on the on the magnet

1324
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,059
strength so if there's any variation in

1325
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:04,920
the in the magnetic field then this line

1326
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,480
will get really funky and then we can't

1327
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,040
tell where the the signals are coming

1328
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,460
from anymore

1329
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,119
all right thank you

1330
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,960
another question

1331
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,599
is there anything you can share with us

1332
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,579
about Libra hub

1333
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,079
I'm not sure what that is I'm sorry

1334
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,280
no okay

1335
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
uh one more question

1336
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,920
hello I'm Xander thanks for the talk

1337
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,559
um I I actually get a full body MRI

1338
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:40,980
every year through a company in the San

1339
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,380
Francisco Bay area called Cube bio and

1340
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,140
as you said it takes about 15 minutes to

1341
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,380
do the scan and I'm curious is there any

1342
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,200
kind of physics based impossibility

1343
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,140
proof around that time or could we

1344
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,619
conceivably do this in five minutes uh

1345
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,079
through some Hardware Innovations

1346
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,900
uh there are a lot of Hardware bounds on

1347
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,640
what's possible um it's basically how

1348
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,500
fast can you get your gradients

1349
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,180
um and there is a physical limitation on

1350
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,800
that because as the gradients get more

1351
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
powerful and uh as the switching gets

1352
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,579
faster it actually induces

1353
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,260
um what's called peripheral nerve

1354
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,880
stimulation and it can cause like

1355
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,040
tingling in your arms it's not dangerous

1356
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,540
as far as I'm aware

1357
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,040
um but it's you know very unpleasant for

1358
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,200
the patient um so the the speed of the

1359
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,700
gradients is a big problem and the speed

1360
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,520
of the gradients depends uh directly on

1361
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,079
how fats we can acquire the images

1362
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,099
you can actually if you're if you're

1363
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,780
getting an MRI I've heard people that

1364
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,099
have been doing this a lot longer than I

1365
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,200
have uh if you listen to The Sounds they

1366
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,119
can actually tell which type of uh pull

1367
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,059
sequence is being run uh at by the sound

1368
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:46,680
it makes

1369
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,359
excellent thank you we have one question

1370
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,880
from our Matrix chat for mod creation

1371
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,559
you were complete you were comparing

1372
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,059
accelerometer-based measurements with

1373
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,859
cameras is the Baseline what's the

1374
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:59,040
advantage compared to cameras

1375
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,980
um the camera was uh kind of a secondary

1376
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,760
thing

1377
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,920
um because uh I I am very like I have a

1378
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,000
background in computer vision so I'm

1379
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,380
really interested in doing and using

1380
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,059
cameras for tracking

1381
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,920
um but we were just using the camera to

1382
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,660
verify

1383
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,280
um the signal from the accelerometer

1384
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,079
because we can't program the patient's

1385
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,119
motion the patient can move in any

1386
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,220
direction at any time so the the camera

1387
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,839
was the only thing I could think of

1388
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,300
because if we if we had a sensor that

1389
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,099
could do this already in the in the MRI

1390
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,319
then we wouldn't need then I wouldn't

1391
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,140
need to do my job in the first place

1392
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,760
um so the fact that Those sensors don't

1393
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,559
exist now is what we're working on

1394
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,180
um so the camera was just to verify it

1395
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,059
because we can't um we have no uh we

1396
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:41,880
have no ground Truth for patient motion

1397
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,220
excellent we have one more question from

1398
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,520
The Matrix chat from what are the image

1399
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,800
formats like can I make a 3D model of my

1400
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,200
own data without proprietary software

1401
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,280
yes

1402
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
um it's called dicom format and there's

1403
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,619
something called Pi dicom in Python and

1404
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,720
yeah you should be able to import dicom

1405
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,800
images

1406
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,260
um and uh I'm not as familiar with that

1407
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,300
side of it but that should definitely be

1408
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,700
possible there's also plenty of free

1409
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,680
uh dicom viewers online there's a

1410
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,500
program called 3D slicer that can also

1411
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,160
import icons

1412
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,300
excellent we got one more question for

1413
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,420
you

1414
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,300
by overlapping your choices or are the

1415
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,599
slices

1416
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,160
in that previous one

1417
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,319
the previous one

1418
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,279
to move between the slices

1419
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,200
I heard it okay

1420
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,660
um uh

1421
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,579
so each slice is acquired one at a time

1422
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,559
there is there is uh I went through the

1423
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,140
very the most basic format for this but

1424
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,020
um uh there is what's called 3D imaging

1425
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,880
now and I'm not really familiar with how

1426
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,500
it works but you can acquire a 3D images

1427
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,800
in one scan uh as far as I understand

1428
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,599
um but because of the the limitations on

1429
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,099
the gradient speeds and how fast we can

1430
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,900
acquire the slices if there's any like

1431
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,420
even a heartbeat motion uh can throw it

1432
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,099
off and it's also like the motion of

1433
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,839
your the

1434
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,880
um blood through your veins has a

1435
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,619
magnetic field so even that has an

1436
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:14,880
effect

1437
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,380
um I'm sorry I'm not answering your

1438
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,859
question though

1439
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:21,839
thank you so much for the talk Doug we

1440
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,579
really appreciate it uh thank you for

1441
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,599
the audience for being here

1442
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,040
yeah thanks everyone and if Doug has any

1443
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,140
information or documents he wants to

1444
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,640
share the presentation you should be

1445
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,140
able to find it he can post the Matrix

1446
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,240
chat for this talk and you will be able

1447
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,640
to see it there uh come back at three

1448
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,280
o'clock our next talk will be

1449
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,260
secure cell phone communication mission

1450
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,480
accomplished or popular delusion by Dr

1451
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,339
Nick Germain so we hope to see you here

1452
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,880
in 10 minutes
