1
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,720
um

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,080
is

3
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
good morning everyone welcome to the

4
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,640
third day of hope how you doing great

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
seeing some good shows

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,960
some good sessions

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
all right well we're going to start off

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
on fire this morning

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
so the

10
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,680
talk this morning is artificial

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
intelligence how iplaw handles machine

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
creations and our presenter here ed ryan

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
is going to help us think about or maybe

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
find some initial answers to the

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
questions of can a machine be an

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
inventor and does the machine's output

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
qualify for for copyright or patent

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
protection so with that i'll pass over

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
to ed

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
good morning everybody

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
all right it looks like it's up there

22
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,240
correctly thank you so much for coming i

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
know it's 10 o'clock on the last day of

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
a hacker convention and

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
we're all worn a little thin so i very

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
much appreciate your your interest

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
um to start off with here's a little bit

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,799
about me i've been a patent attorney for

29
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
14 years my background is in physics

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,959
but the thing with physics is it kind of

31
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
gives you a general applicability to a

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
lot of different things

33
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
and when i was in college i was also

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
marinating in computer science

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
just by kind of hanging around

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
so i have over time wormed my way into

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
working on machine learning

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
i handle a lot of machine learning cases

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,239
and

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
as a result i come to you as a very

41
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
serious person to talk about very

42
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,760
serious things

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
i think i've represented my general

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,519
attitude toward life well in my pictures

45
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,400
there

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,160
i'm also going to take this opportunity

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
to very briefly give a shout out to my

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
children who i think are watching on

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
youtube right now hi i will see you all

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
later

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
so

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
this whole this this talk is about

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
artificial intelligence and before we

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
can even interface with that question

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
we have to know what we're talking about

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
and the problem with with that is the

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,159
definition of what is artificial

58
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
intelligence has changed dramatically

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
over the course of decades right the

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
field has its start in the 60s and it

61
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
has this bad habit of moving the goal

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
posts where every time

63
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
something new comes out like oh man look

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
at this great artificial intelligence

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
and 10 years later it's old hat and like

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
that we've been doing that for years

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
this is artificial intelligence so for

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
the purpose of this talk today

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
we're going to talk about what you know

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
everybody kind of refers to in the

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
the common uh conversation as artificial

72
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,080
intelligence we're going to be talking

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
about advanced machine learning

74
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
tools um

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
that

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,239
are are trained on a large amount of

77
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,760
data right uh they're they're usually in

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
a neural network architecture in

79
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,360
particular a deep neural network

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
architecture and we'll get into that in

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
a little bit

82
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
um but this this new model of artificial

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
intelligence systems has had tremendous

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
success in certain regards

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
deeply creepy success in certain regards

86
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
that have like made people stand back

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
and and really wonder like what is going

88
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
on here is this a new class of thing

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,840
um

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
so when we talk you know just to tell

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
you what i'm going to tell you we're

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
going to start by giving you a quick

93
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
very surface level understanding of

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
what an artificial intelligence system

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
looks like and how it works we're going

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
to move on to talking about some

97
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
pressing examples that are really you

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,040
know really motivated this talk uh so

99
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
we're going to talk about dolly and its

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
ability to create you know photo

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
realistic

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
uh and really compelling artwork we're

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
going to talk about lambda a little bit

104
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
the the google chat bot that raised

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
questions recently about its uh

106
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,360
sentience by

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
coming right out and saying hey i'm

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
sentient don't turn me off um we're

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
going to talk about the law

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
and so

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,039
the law in this case means copyright law

112
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,479
and patent law because the purpose of

113
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
this talk is to take the output

114
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
of these machine learning models

115
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
and

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
figure out whether that output is

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,400
entitled to copyright protection or

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
patent protection under our current

119
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
intellectual property laws and we're

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
really not going to be talking about

121
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,479
sentience and we're not going to be

122
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
talking about a lot of the ethical

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
considerations that that people are

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,639
trying to bite into right now there is

125
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,000
so much

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
to talk about

127
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
around

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
artificial intelligence

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
and

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
i'm really trying to focus because

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,600
otherwise we would spend the entire day

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,479
here

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,280
um

134
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,759
so let's start with talking about ai and

135
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
what ai can do just for reference this

136
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,160
is a ai generated face swap of stephen

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
wolfram's face with isaac newton

138
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
um

139
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
so

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
in general terms

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,440
a neural network and or an ai and let's

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
let's focus on neural networks because

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
that's that's the the most common and

144
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
powerful technology we have right now it

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
can be thought of as a universal

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
approximator

147
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
and so what that means is a neural

148
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
network is just a function

149
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,360
it takes an input it does some work on

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
it it produces an output and in that

151
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,919
respect it's equivalent

152
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,560
or or you know approximate to

153
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
any other function

154
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
that you're modeling right so you could

155
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
have

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,960
in my view there's really no

157
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
material difference between a neural

158
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,319
network and a classically programmed

159
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
computer program the difference

160
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
is not in the function the difference is

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
in how it's created right so with a

162
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
computer program you have an engineer

163
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,199
who sits down and says i want the thing

164
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
to do the thing

165
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,400
and so i'm going to create all of the

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
structures all of the processes that are

167
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
required and it's going to behave

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,759
exactly as i intend it to exactly as i

169
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,680
tell it to

170
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
the way and a neural network system

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
works is you create an architecture

172
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,479
right you have there are a variety of

173
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,599
different kinds of neural network

174
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
architectures that are better you know

175
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
some are better for some purposes than

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
others but you create this architecture

177
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
and then you throw data at it

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
right you throw a

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
huge volume of of either labeled or

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
unlabeled data depending on you know how

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,360
much

182
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
uh human interaction is really required

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
and it learns how to mimic the

184
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
situations that created that data and

185
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
this data can really come down to be

186
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,319
anything that's quantified right so when

187
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
you're talking about a picture

188
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
we have tons and we have huge volumes of

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,520
training data because we have we have a

190
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
lot of pictures right video streams

191
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,759
every every frame of that is a picture

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
and that can be quantified according to

193
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
its pixel values so you take a picture

194
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,919
you put it into the machine learning

195
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,960
system

196
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
it breaks it down into a set of features

197
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
it works on those features and it gives

198
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
you the output you look for

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
you can do that for really any kind of

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,360
sensor

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
right so we have machine learning

202
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,919
systems that are constantly monitoring

203
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,039
looking for anomalous system behavior

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
because it's learned what normal system

205
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,519
behavior looks like based on a large

206
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,360
volume of training data so when

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
something new happens it can say hey

208
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,839
this is weird let's do something about

209
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,799
it

210
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,839
and

211
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
really the source of all of the the

212
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,959
creepy

213
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
behavior when it comes to machine

214
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
learning systems comes from the fact

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
that you can also quantify

216
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
words and language

217
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,279
in a way that's really astoundingly

218
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
powerful right because what you can end

219
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
up doing is you can take a word and

220
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
quantify it not by like this is the

221
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
letter a and it has a value one you end

222
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
up quantifying it by its meaning

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
we have tools that will take words and

224
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,880
sentences and represent them in this

225
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
large multi-dimensional space

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
where a vector points to a particular

227
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,560
spot and that's just what that word

228
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
means

229
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,320
in a numerical fashion so let's talk

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,279
about the the ai system and how

231
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
how it does what it does and just super

232
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
surface level this picture here made it

233
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
on ms paint it looks like every other

234
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
basic neural network uh explanation you

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
have you can look at it as a set of

236
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,320
vertical columns right on the left you

237
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
have a column of input neurons on the

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
right you have a column of output

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
neurons and in the middle you have the

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
hidden neurons and that's where the

241
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,240
magic happens so your input neurons you

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,640
you you know if you had a a

243
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
a photograph

244
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
right that was 100 by 100 pixels

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
you would have

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,720
uh

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
10 000 input neurons one for each pixel

248
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
or more you know depending on how many

249
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
different values you're tracking from

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
that from each pixel

251
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
and then the output let's say this is um

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
we're classifying right so we have this

253
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
input image we want to know if there's a

254
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
face in it it's a very common machine

255
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
learning task the output might just be

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
a single bit yes or no there's a face

257
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,519
here there isn't a face here it could be

258
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
more complicated in addition to having a

259
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,079
face it could have a bounding box that

260
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,720
says the face is within this square

261
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
in the image

262
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
the lines between the neurons could be

263
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
called synapses or weights whatever

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
depending on how closely you want to

265
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
hold to the

266
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,079
the brain analogy

267
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,360
um

268
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
those represent really just uh

269
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
coefficients

270
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,320
okay so when you when you do the feed

271
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
forward operation which is i am running

272
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
this i'm giving it an input i want to

273
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
see what the output is you put your

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,959
input in each neuron has a function

275
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,480
inside it

276
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
that that operates a very simple

277
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,079
function generally

278
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,320
produces an output that output is

279
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,279
weighted

280
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
by the synapse so it's multiplied by

281
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,279
whatever the code you know that

282
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
coefficient is and becomes the input

283
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
to one of the layers uh to one of the

284
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
neurons in the next layer

285
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
this is what's called a fully connected

286
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
layer in that each neuron

287
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
of

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
uh of a given layer is connected to

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
every neuron of the next layer there are

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
you know this is basically as simple as

291
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
it gets you can have

292
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
thousands millions however many layers

293
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
you want and that's what you call a deep

294
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
neural network and what ends up

295
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
happening is the more layers you get the

296
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,640
more complexity you can really capture

297
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
so that's that's the the

298
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
simple uh

299
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
i'm running this and i want to get an

300
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
output now when we're training this

301
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,440
neural network what we do is we take our

302
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
training data set and we split it in two

303
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,920
or three right we we are looking to

304
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
run it

305
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,440
on a set first we run it on a set of

306
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
instances where we know what the answer

307
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
is going to be

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
okay so we run it through we're

309
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
expecting it to give us a five and it

310
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
gives us a four that's an error right

311
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
the machine learning model has failed to

312
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
give us what we know the true answer to

313
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
be because this training data set is

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,920
labeled somebody sat down and said yes

315
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,519
there's a face in this one no there's

316
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
not a face in this one and so when it

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,399
gives us an error we calculate

318
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
what that error is

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,120
using some

320
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
optimization function whatever whatever

321
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,800
the tool we're using

322
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
and then we propagate it backward

323
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,079
through the neural network

324
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
right and that lets us

325
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
change the synapse weights

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
to reflect the fact that we had an error

327
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
ideally

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,480
to correct that error and move us closer

329
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
to the correct answer so that now when

330
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
we run the next piece of data it gets

331
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
closer and closer and hopefully

332
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,880
eventually converges and then we test it

333
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
by looking at our second

334
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
batch of data

335
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
and we say are you giving us the correct

336
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,160
answer for data that you haven't seen

337
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,200
before

338
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
and that lets us validate that we did a

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,399
good job of training

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
and so i'm going to take us a little

341
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
aside here because a lot of the types of

342
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
data that we've mentioned so far right

343
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
works of of uh

344
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
graphical works pictures um text a lot

345
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
of this is already copyrighted by

346
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
individual human beings who wrote these

347
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,880
things or painted these things or took

348
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,160
the picture and in those cases

349
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
we have to

350
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
there is a there's an open legal

351
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
question of to what degree is it legal

352
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
to use somebody else's copyrighted work

353
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
to train a neural network

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
all right so i i don't want to give you

355
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
the impression that this is all you know

356
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,639
that's

357
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,920
even now

358
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
this early on in the talk we were

359
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,279
running into legal problems and that's

360
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
not even the legal problem that i wanted

361
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,959
to spend time on today but it's

362
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
something to keep in mind that every

363
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
step of the way

364
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
because this is such a new technology

365
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
every step of the way

366
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,399
we really don't know what we're doing

367
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
um and i say that with with authority as

368
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
an attorney

369
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
all right so let's talk about what we

370
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
can do with ai and there are a lot of

371
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,959
very powerful things and a lot of kind

372
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,079
of unsettling things we have um the

373
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
thing that really creeps me out is face

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
swapping and deep fakes uh it really

375
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
like undermines

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,959
uh

377
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,519
my you know trust in in what we see in a

378
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,079
way that i i did not expect to see so

379
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
soon um

380
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,399
we have facial recognition in crowds

381
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
right where in a crowd of 100 people

382
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
this computer can point out the the bad

383
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
actor that we've you know got in our

384
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
database um we have convincing human

385
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,040
chat bots human level art in this case i

386
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
have some examples of a funny picture of

387
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,000
me with some unsettling uh filters that

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,760
were generated to put them in different

389
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
styles but at the end of the day

390
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
all of these are about processing a kind

391
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
of meaning right

392
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
and i want to tie this back to what we

393
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
were talking about when we when i

394
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
mentioned

395
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,240
words

396
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,720
because it's and this is a personal

397
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
feeling

398
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
that i'm expressing i find it deeply

399
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,880
unsettling that a computer can so easily

400
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
manipulate meaning

401
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
instead of just you know on on the level

402
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
of meaning right this means the same

403
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,839
thing as that thing

404
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,800
right

405
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
that

406
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
is is really the heart of of where the

407
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,759
creepiness comes from in my in my view

408
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
um oh and that's what i'm already

409
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
talking about so

410
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,759
um

411
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,519
just to give you an idea here of how

412
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,839
that works there's a very common tool

413
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,680
called word to vec it learns base and

414
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
it's it's unsupervised which is to say

415
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
no human being sits down and programs in

416
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
the meaning of these words

417
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
right so it takes a large corpus of of

418
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,440
written text

419
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
and it churns through it and it does it

420
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
based on kind of word placement where if

421
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,000
a word is placed in a similar place in

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,839
sentences as another word it has a

423
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
similar meaning

424
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
right and as a result it can put those

425
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
on this thousand dimension space

426
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
to give really accurate results for what

427
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
that word means

428
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
um

429
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
so let's let's now start applying that

430
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,160
concept

431
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
dolly and dolly too have been getting a

432
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
lot of um traction lately and they're an

433
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,920
example of of you know extracting

434
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
meaning and representing it in a

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,199
different way

436
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,360
right similar to face swapping we're

437
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
extracting the face the meaning here and

438
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
we're putting it you know in a place it

439
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
it could belong based on its context and

440
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
its meaning

441
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,199
dali takes a natural language input

442
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,079
extracts the meaning from it

443
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
and creates an image that represents

444
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,760
that meaning right and it's based on

445
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,359
gpt-3 which is kind of a

446
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
state-of-the-art

447
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
language model

448
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,400
um and it creates

449
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
outputs that are really like

450
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
human-level art

451
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,280
um

452
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
and i just want to say i'm so grateful

453
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,119
that all of these things have been

454
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,640
happening because it makes it very easy

455
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
for me creating a presentation to come

456
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
up with um

457
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
images

458
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,120
uh so most of the most of the the images

459
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,400
that you're going to see are actually

460
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
just me

461
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
fussing around with um

462
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
uh dolly mini or my friend let me uh

463
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,720
abuse his dolly access

464
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
to to get some higher quality stuff as

465
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
well

466
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
um so let's give another example which

467
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
is lambda which is the google chat bot

468
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
that was in the news recently for being

469
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,400
like hey i'm sentient i promise um but

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
as it's relevant to this talk

471
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,080
part of the proof for that was the guy

472
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,520
asked lamda can you write a fable

473
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
about your experiences

474
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
and it did right it wrote something that

475
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
you know it's not particularly

476
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
sophisticated literature but if you were

477
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
to look at this and ask

478
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,559
you know assume that this were the

479
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,400
output of a human being and ask is this

480
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
copyrightable the answer would be yes

481
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
right this is an actual story not copied

482
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
from anywhere not you know it's an

483
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
original in the sense that it is new

484
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
and we haven't seen this particular

485
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
thing before and it was created by a

486
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,160
machine

487
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
now we're going to take a little bit of

488
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
a weird turn because we're going to talk

489
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,280
about dabbas

490
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,360
now we're getting into patent law

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
okay

492
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
and

493
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
patent law fun operates in a very

494
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
different way from copyright law it's

495
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,799
not about

496
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
you know this creative expression it's

497
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
about whether you have created something

498
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
new non-obvious and useful

499
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
and so this guy dr stephen taylor or

500
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
thayer

501
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
um

502
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
created davis which is an ai model

503
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
uh that purportedly

504
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
generates inventions

505
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
and does so in a way that in you know

506
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,520
with all of the enabling details so that

507
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
a person having ordinary skill in the

508
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
art would be able to make and use that

509
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
invention and i've got a picture here

510
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,918
this is a fractal-shaped food container

511
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
this is currently like working its way

512
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,480
through the courts actually um but

513
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
dr thaler claims he played no role in

514
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,559
the conception of this invention and

515
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,720
that the device itself is the inventor

516
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,559
which you know

517
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,039
speaking from my perspective as somebody

518
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,120
who is passingly familiar with machine

519
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,480
learning technologies that's pretty

520
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
dubious but it's treated as true for the

521
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
sake of litigation um which is an

522
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
interesting way to approach it uh

523
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
basically the patent office never

524
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
stopped and said hey

525
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,840
you dr thaler should be a an inventor

526
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
here instead what they did was they took

527
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
him at his word and they said well

528
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,520
a machine can't be an inventor and so

529
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,320
for the sake of litigation we're we're

530
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
accepting it as true that the machine

531
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
did all of the work here

532
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
uh and then something that just you know

533
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
recently popped up is the github

534
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,880
co-pilot which is a machine learning

535
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,960
model trained on the corpus of code

536
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
stored in github

537
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
and what it does is it generates new

538
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
code right it's basically an uh a

539
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
complex autocomplete feature for

540
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
for source code

541
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
um

542
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,559
and there are a bunch of open questions

543
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
and and upset

544
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
uh people who are pointing out that

545
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,720
sometimes it generates the same code

546
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
that was in the training data uh and

547
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
that raises questions of licensing it

548
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
raises questions of copyright

549
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,679
infringement naturally um

550
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,000
it's a

551
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,080
sorry i just skipped a gear there um in

552
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,200
any case

553
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,960
it's it's yet another example of a place

554
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
where

555
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,679
a machine is generating useful outputs

556
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,440
that if they were generated by a human

557
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
being there would be no question this is

558
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
copyrightable stuff

559
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,960
and finally i want to give you uh

560
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,760
a counterpoint which is the the old

561
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
infinite monkey theorem right and the

562
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
concept here is that if you give a

563
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,679
monkey a typewriter and you hit that

564
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,840
monkey bash on the typewriter at random

565
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
for an infinite amount of time it will

566
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,120
generate any arbitrary work right it

567
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,559
will generate the complete works of

568
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,159
shakespeare word for word letter for

569
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,159
letter with no errors because infinity

570
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
is really big and that's how randomness

571
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
works um

572
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
and so the question that we have to ask

573
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,799
ourselves is this monkey different

574
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,400
from

575
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
an ai right is this monkey which is just

576
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
another kind of another kind of way of

577
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
representing a system that is generating

578
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,000
a useful output

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
an output that if it were created by a

580
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
human being without question we would

581
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
protect it you know either a patent or

582
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
copyright or whatever

583
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
right and we kind of intuitively sense

584
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
this is just random noise and the fact

585
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,080
that the random noise happens to have

586
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
something that looked like a signal in

587
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
it

588
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,559
doesn't imply

589
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,440
that it's entitled to the rights and

590
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,320
privileges of a human being as set out

591
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,799
in the copyright and patent statute so i

592
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
want to i want you to keep that in mind

593
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
right everything that we're going to be

594
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
talking about today compare that to the

595
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
monkey

596
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
okay so now we're going to start talking

597
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,039
about the law

598
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,080
and i'm going to have a sip of water

599
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
all right

600
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
so patent law and copyright law

601
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,760
i'm gonna i've quoted from the relevant

602
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
statutes here but patent law

603
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,640
um grants

604
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
exclusive rights to inventors whomever

605
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
invents or discovers any new and useful

606
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
process machine manufacturer

607
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
copyright law covers original works of

608
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,039
authorship

609
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,400
so in both cases we have this vague

610
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,679
subject right the author the inventor

611
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,600
and we it's our job today to try and

612
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
figure out how broad those terms really

613
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,120
are

614
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
the the

615
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
source of these come from the united

616
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
states constitution at least in our

617
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,799
realm right i can't speak so much for

618
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,400
for other countries but in the

619
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
constitution we have an explicit

620
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
provision that empowers congress to make

621
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
laws like this to promote the progress

622
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,960
of science and useful arts

623
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
by ex uh securing for limited times to

624
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
authors and inventors

625
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,640
and so it turns out that the founding

626
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,760
fathers

627
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
didn't have any idea

628
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
that such a thing as an ai would exist

629
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
someday uh and there's not a lot of

630
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,000
guidance there for what did they really

631
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,919
mean when they say author and inventor

632
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
because at the time there was only one

633
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,679
thing that it could mean and that was a

634
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,720
natural human being

635
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,200
so it turns out that the concept of

636
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
non-human authorship has already been

637
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,279
explored in the law

638
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,000
but not for machines rather for animals

639
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
one example is the monkey selfie case

640
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
where the courts found that copyrights

641
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
do not expressly authorize monkeys to

642
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,640
sue

643
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
over copyrights basically they lack

644
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
standing under the copyright law

645
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
um

646
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
and that you know the courts have also

647
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,360
found that

648
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
congress can give

649
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
animals the right to sue but they need

650
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,799
to be really clear about what they're

651
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,120
doing right and so we can take that and

652
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,840
we can extend that concept

653
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,279
to machines and we have to ask ourselves

654
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,000
does this machine have

655
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
more agency more creativity

656
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,480
than

657
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
the monkey did when the monkey picked up

658
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
the camera and hit the shutter

659
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,279
and that exact question is being raised

660
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
by dr thaler

661
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,880
because he filed a copyright application

662
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,480
and it was rejected on this very

663
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,799
principle the copyright office will only

664
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,360
grant copyrights that have been authored

665
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,479
by human beings

666
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,200
but a deeper question to ask is the

667
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
question about originality because the

668
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
copyright law requires that the work be

669
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
original and that's more than just

670
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,679
novelty

671
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,880
right the courts have found that

672
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
originality requires a modicum of

673
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,559
creativity right so you can't just

674
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,120
collect data and put it in a spreadsheet

675
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,559
and say look i i authored this i get a

676
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,799
copyright over this it came up in phone

677
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,600
books and in databases where people

678
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,279
tried to say

679
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,640
i own this data that i worked hard to

680
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
collect and collate but because it lacks

681
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,039
the creativity necessary

682
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
it cannot be protected and so we have to

683
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,559
ask ourselves not just is

684
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,279
an ai allowed to be an author but does

685
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,679
the ai have the required creativity

686
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
in order to qualify right and

687
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,720
again when we look at

688
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
the product

689
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,320
generated by dolly right for example um

690
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
i forget what the prompt was this was uh

691
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,799
this the prompt here was a robot that

692
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
failed at painting

693
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,679
right

694
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,679
that's a good picture of a robot who's

695
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,480
failing at painting right that shows if

696
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
i had made that that would be pretty

697
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
creative i think but i didn't i told a

698
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
machine to do it for me

699
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
right and so

700
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
the machine going back to what we were

701
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,080
talking about before is just a function

702
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,000
it's just taking an input and spitting

703
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
out an output according to

704
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
its deterministic processes

705
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,679
and the fact that you can you know pour

706
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,240
some randomness into that machine

707
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
i'm not sure that that necessarily

708
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,720
qualifies it to be considered creative

709
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
one more thing to consider

710
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,080
is the use of tools because copyright

711
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,170
law lets you

712
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,799
[Music]

713
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,720
get a copyright even if you use

714
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
sophisticated tools to generate your

715
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
output

716
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,279
right and so this comes up in

717
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,760
photography

718
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
the photographer did not create the

719
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,360
flower

720
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,919
that they are photographing right they

721
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,880
didn't they

722
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,159
looked at it they said hey that looks

723
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,600
cool they took out their camera and they

724
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,559
snapped a picture and the machine

725
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,120
created the picture

726
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,399
but that's okay because the human being

727
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,880
did have creative input they picked the

728
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
lighting they picked the framing they

729
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,520
picked the angle they had that modicum

730
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,960
of creativity that was required um

731
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
but something to keep in mind is that

732
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,440
even even

733
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
though we can use sophisticated tools

734
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,480
the bear idea itself

735
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
is not

736
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
copyrightable and that's explicit in the

737
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
copyright statute

738
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
right so if i have an idea no matter how

739
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
i explain how about you know whatever

740
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,120
form i put that bare idea in

741
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
it itself is not copyrightable it's the

742
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,360
expression of that idea that's

743
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,320
copyrightable right so if i have a story

744
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
in my mind

745
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,480
right and it's like man fights walrus

746
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,760
and loses

747
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
right that's just that's that's just an

748
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,960
idea

749
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
if i write a story

750
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
that specific expression of the idea

751
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
is copyrightable

752
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,120
but if somebody else writes their own

753
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,240
man fights walrus story

754
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
i can't stop them from doing that

755
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,799
because all they've taken is that idea

756
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,279
and i want to use this to draw an

757
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,799
analogy that i think

758
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,640
is a very powerful one

759
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,600
in understanding the role the ai plays

760
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,559
here

761
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,880
okay because it's easy to imagine

762
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,440
replacing that ai with a human being

763
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,320
right take dolly out of the equation and

764
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,360
put an actual artist in its place

765
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
okay

766
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,480
and i go to that artist and i want to

767
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
commission an oil painting of a man

768
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
fighting a walrus

769
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
and my artist friend goes out and does

770
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,840
it and i pay them and i get my painting

771
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,240
but they own the copyright

772
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
all i supplied was the idea

773
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,679
the artist created the art

774
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,559
in the context of dolly that's all my

775
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,520
involvement is is giving the prompt

776
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,480
giving the bare idea and the machine

777
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,279
is creating the art

778
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
and so we have to ask whether the

779
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
machine on its own

780
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,159
can own that copyright because my

781
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,039
involvement as the human being in this

782
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,919
case is not that of a human being using

783
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,720
a tool to create art my involvement is

784
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,080
no greater

785
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,279
than commissioning an actual artist to

786
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,000
create the art

787
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
so let's talk about the current

788
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
litigation in the field this is the uh

789
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
on on the screen we have the subject

790
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,520
matter of um dr thayer's copyright

791
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,919
lawsuit he named his model the cop the

792
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,679
creativity machine

793
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,679
uh which the copyright office denied

794
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,240
registration to uh and that this is all

795
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,760
recent this is in the past couple of

796
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
months and thawer is now appealing that

797
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,720
decision um to the federal district

798
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,240
court and so if you want to learn more

799
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,880
about the copyright issues

800
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
the the documents are actually pretty

801
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,600
good reading you can find the

802
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,960
um refusal from the copyright office

803
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
that lays out in in great detail the

804
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
case law and all of the reasoning behind

805
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
why they take the position that a

806
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,559
machine cannot be an author and you can

807
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,840
find in dr thaler's complaint or appeal

808
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
you know brief

809
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
all of his reasons for why he thinks it

810
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
should be

811
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,080
highly recommended if you're a

812
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
giant nerd like me

813
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
okay

814
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,120
so now let's turn our view to patent law

815
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,440
in patent law we're talking about now

816
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
inventorship which is a distinct concept

817
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,399
from authorship because an inventor

818
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
is not required to be creative

819
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
right there's no modicum of creativity

820
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
and all that's required is that this

821
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
creation be new and useful and

822
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,360
non-obvious um

823
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
and so the pattern law actually does

824
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
define what an inventor is it's the indi

825
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
individual who invented or discovered

826
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
the subject matter of the invention

827
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
which doesn't help us in our in our

828
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
inquiry here um

829
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,399
but we can

830
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,480
maybe shed some light onto that by

831
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,200
looking at the policy behind it right

832
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
the constitution's stated purpose for

833
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
the patent law

834
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,240
is to promote the useful arts and uh

835
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
promote science and the useful arts and

836
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
so we have to ask

837
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,519
is does protecting a machine

838
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,600
a machine as an inventor

839
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,960
do that

840
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,320
i think

841
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,399
and and you know again we're in such un

842
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,919
uncharted territory here i think the

843
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,360
answer is yes from a policy

844
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,760
consideration because ultimately

845
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,640
if we want to promote innovation and our

846
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
tool for promoting innovation is handing

847
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,000
out patents

848
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
well i guess it's okay you know it

849
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
doesn't make that much of a difference

850
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
whether we give you know name the

851
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,120
inventor as the person running the

852
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,360
system or the system itself

853
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
but a more challenging

854
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,640
piece of the puzzle is that the courts

855
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,679
going past the statute the courts have

856
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
said that an inventor is required to

857
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,320
contribute to the conception

858
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,080
of the invention and conception is a

859
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,120
weighty word right that that involves

860
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,840
mental involvement um in my

861
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,760
understanding it involves not an

862
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,519
understanding of

863
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,519
of of novelty because i can see how

864
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,200
a machine learning system can actually

865
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,519
do that right it can say

866
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
based on its access to the entire bulk

867
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,039
of of patents you know issued patents

868
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,279
that it has access to um

869
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,880
it can say whether it's seen something

870
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,799
like this before or not and it can you

871
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,240
know that's something that a machine

872
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
learning model is pretty good at is

873
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,840
detecting something that it hasn't been

874
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
trained on

875
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,440
um and you know generating stuff that

876
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,600
that kind of follows a model but is not

877
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,519
you know exactly the same

878
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,480
um

879
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,039
but in terms of conception i see that as

880
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,840
more recognizing the utility of

881
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,320
something right not just saying this is

882
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,600
what the thing is it's new but saying

883
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,080
this is what this is useful for right

884
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,320
having a person sit down and sift

885
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640
through the output of the infinite

886
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,200
monkey to say hey monkey you've really

887
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,199
got something here that's a human

888
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,639
conception

889
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,560
right we're very good at that you know

890
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,839
picking

891
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,599
signal out of the noise

892
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,679
and i'm not sure an ai would have the

893
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
ability to recognize usefulness in the

894
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,760
same way and maybe they would right but

895
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,679
you maybe you can put in enough

896
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
usefulness data

897
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,399
to have it have a usefulness classifier

898
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,239
as it stands right now i'm not convinced

899
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
that the machine is capable of

900
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,199
conception

901
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,719
um

902
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,280
so dr thaler is also deeply involved in

903
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
the patent law uh

904
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,960
wild frontier here um he's got two

905
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,719
applications i showed you one of them

906
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,359
earlier that he is suing on behalf of

907
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,520
his computer for

908
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,440
um they were regret again um rejected on

909
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,119
the grounds that a computer cannot be an

910
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
inventor and this one has progressed a

911
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,440
lot farther than the copyright one has

912
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
this one has actually gone through the

913
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,839
the first level it's gone through the

914
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,680
patent office it's gone through the

915
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
first level of appeal and it's gone up

916
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
to the federal circuit and if you don't

917
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
know anything about you know how patent

918
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,359
law gets

919
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,599
worked on that's one step shy of the

920
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,359
supreme court it's kind of like the

921
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,760
patent court where patents like most

922
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
patent law gets made

923
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
and they've just recently had oral

924
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,280
arguments which are again a fun listen

925
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,640
if you're into that

926
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,160
but we have not seen a decision on it

927
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,760
yet if i had to predict i would say that

928
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,599
dr thaler will probably not be

929
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,960
successful

930
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
on the grounds of conception

931
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,160
uh if nothing else

932
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,359
so

933
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,079
dr thayer is making this a worldwide

934
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,079
project uh and he's actually got a

935
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,800
patent in south africa um and has been

936
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,040
rejected in many many other places he

937
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,000
actually

938
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
was initially successful in australia

939
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
and then an appeals court knocked him

940
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
back down

941
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
um

942
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
so let's let's take a moment and think

943
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,760
here

944
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,400
what is what is the purpose of this

945
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,520
nobody is actually trying to claim

946
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
except for dr thayer nobody's really

947
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,400
trying to claim that the machine is an

948
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,320
inventor or the machine

949
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
is an author because they would much

950
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,400
rather claim that they themselves were

951
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,440
right i would rather be the inventor

952
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,320
than be the assignee by virtue of owning

953
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
the inventor

954
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,800
um

955
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
but i have i i suspect that dr thaler is

956
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,119
a true believer and is doing this to

957
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,720
cause a ruckus more than anything else

958
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,480
in many cases particularly in the

959
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,079
uh patent world

960
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,280
you know i think that's that's a

961
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
perfectly reasonable reasonable approach

962
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,599
to machine generated output is just give

963
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,040
it to the human

964
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,680
right um

965
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,000
in the you know following my motto of

966
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,480
conception there the human is doing a

967
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,119
good chunk of this work by saying hey

968
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,160
this is something right i expect that dr

969
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,960
thayor did not just take the first

970
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
output of the machine and file it as a

971
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,280
patent i expect he sat down and flipped

972
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,800
through some garbage and picked out

973
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,480
something that looked okay

974
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,200
right he was involved i am i haven't met

975
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,640
the guy you know i haven't maybe maybe

976
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
he was maybe he's very convincing and he

977
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
could vince he could convince me that

978
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
his system works but as far as i can

979
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
tell based on my knowledge of the art

980
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
there was a human being involved in the

981
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,000
conception process and so could be a

982
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
valid inventor now i want to distinguish

983
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
that from the copyright world i have my

984
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,280
my

985
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,640
personal belief has settled on

986
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,119
the the conclusion

987
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,920
that the output of dolly is not

988
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
copyrightable

989
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
in the same you know following the

990
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
analogy i gave you before

991
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,359
of

992
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,320
me hiring commissioning a work of art

993
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,000
from a human being

994
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
the human

995
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,839
didn't

996
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,200
provide the

997
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,839
the art the human didn't do the act that

998
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,079
is copyrightable they did not create the

999
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
expression

1000
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
and the machine

1001
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,520
which did create it

1002
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,839
is not doesn't

1003
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,079
qualify as an author and so there's

1004
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,320
nobody in that chain

1005
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,119
who could own the copyright and so it's

1006
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,560
my belief that

1007
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,200
dolly and you know lambda's story and

1008
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
what have you

1009
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
although they were prompted by a human

1010
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
being that human being would not own the

1011
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,880
output and i also think that the dali

1012
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,480
people open ai

1013
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
do not own the output they're trying to

1014
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,119
the terms of use for dali says that you

1015
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,240
as a user have to do whatever you can to

1016
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
help them own

1017
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,720
that output um

1018
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
but i just don't think it i don't think

1019
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,320
it works right the the dots aren't

1020
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
connecting there

1021
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,359
um and so that's where we stand right

1022
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
now the

1023
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,839
the the courts are actively involved on

1024
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,359
all of these fronts and there are so

1025
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
many other legal issues that we didn't

1026
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,640
even touch on

1027
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,720
um that

1028
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,560
that could you know shake the whole

1029
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
foundation of it right the question of

1030
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
whether you can fairly use copyrighted

1031
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,000
work for training material if that's a

1032
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,040
no

1033
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,960
suddenly all of our training corpuses

1034
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,359
disappear right because

1035
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,640
well most of them there are a lot of

1036
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
things that were you know designed for

1037
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,760
the purpose

1038
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,359
right

1039
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,359
for limited purposes and some of them

1040
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,119
that are just like hey guys we have a

1041
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
bunch of pictures

1042
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,359
of street scenes that are labeled with

1043
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,359
cars and people and what have you that

1044
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,240
are good for you know like limited

1045
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,520
um

1046
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
limited functions but we wouldn't have

1047
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,480
access to the huge swath

1048
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
of creative data that's out there in

1049
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
terms of literature that's still under

1050
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,079
copyright

1051
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,079
photos that are still under copyright

1052
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,680
computer code that's still under

1053
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
copyright you know you would need to get

1054
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,119
permission from each one of those

1055
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,240
authors

1056
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,479
in order to make use of it um

1057
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,000
and so at the end of the day also i want

1058
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
to bring you back to the infinite monkey

1059
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,640
right because

1060
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
we're going to have to contend with the

1061
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,640
fact that this is a machine

1062
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,119
this is this is a machine that has no

1063
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,560
agency

1064
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,280
it has no free will it has no awareness

1065
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
of what it's doing despite what it might

1066
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,280
claim

1067
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,960
and we have to contend with the fact

1068
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,760
that

1069
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,359
when you have a system like that it's no

1070
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,880
different from a machine you know a

1071
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
monkey that's bashing on a computer and

1072
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,240
occasionally generates

1073
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,359
a useful output and on that note i want

1074
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,520
to give you a little snippet

1075
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,680
of the

1076
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
oral arguments

1077
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
presented by dr thaler's attorney

1078
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,400
to the federal circuit

1079
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,760
um

1080
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
in his patent case right this was at the

1081
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,119
very end

1082
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
um the

1083
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,440
the

1084
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
dr thayer's attorney went first the

1085
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
patent office went second and dr thaler

1086
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
had i think three minutes to rebut and

1087
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,040
this is just at the very tail end uh the

1088
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,280
first voice you will hear is one of the

1089
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
judges on the panel and the second voice

1090
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,280
you will hear is dr thayer's attorney

1091
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,200
the invented entity by the way do you

1092
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,760
happen to know do the um the you know

1093
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,880
phil

1094
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,480
the mythic monkeys who type out

1095
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,079
shakespeare get to be copyright holders

1096
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,920
um well i see i passed my time

1097
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,119
and that's my time as well at least for

1098
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,280
for talking purposes we have some time

1099
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,440
for questions i think i see somebody

1100
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,359
standing there waiting

1101
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,119
at the ready

1102
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,319
and if you really want to talk about

1103
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,560
sentience at this point we can

1104
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
and if you really really want to talk

1105
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,480
about it you know you can

1106
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,079
find me in the hallway and and we can

1107
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,760
fight yes hello um i have two questions

1108
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,319
the the first is how can taylor even sue

1109
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,200
it all

1110
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
if the if the device doesn't have

1111
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,359
sentience how can he even have standing

1112
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,280
so in other words how can he have can't

1113
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,319
they just throw it out right in the

1114
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,599
beginning and say you don't have

1115
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,839
standing the software would have to sue

1116
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,760
and then and then that's the first

1117
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,119
hurdle that the software would have to

1118
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,280
have a sentence presumably let's just

1119
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,560
call it software would have to have a

1120
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,240
sentence before it could even have

1121
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
standing to sue for itself right so that

1122
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,400
goes back to the the monkey case right

1123
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,160
where and i think that the distinction i

1124
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,839
haven't i haven't looked too deeply into

1125
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,560
that particular question my my gut is

1126
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
that the distinction lies in the fact

1127
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,680
that thaler actually owns the system

1128
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,440
right and the monkey was just a wild

1129
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,599
monkey right and so there was nobody who

1130
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,040
could sue on behalf of this

1131
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,319
monkey

1132
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,800
because it was just a monkey in africa

1133
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
that happens to pick up this guy's

1134
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,040
camera um

1135
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,560
the

1136
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,960
the computer on the other hand is very

1137
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,240
much dr thaler's property and so

1138
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
i don't know i i you you have a valid

1139
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,880
question is what i'm trying to say and i

1140
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
think that that's the answer to it but i

1141
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,480
haven't looked too deeply in the briefs

1142
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,280
on that

1143
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,599
okay and then the second part and this

1144
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,440
relates i mean it can even relate to

1145
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,920
let's say oracle v google as well right

1146
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,839
the idea of you know if we look at

1147
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,599
software and we look at the

1148
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,000
the corpus of the data that goes into

1149
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,400
the then parts of it go into the the end

1150
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,440
solution right so with all of the pharma

1151
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,680
companies now using machine learning to

1152
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,920
work and develop new drugs in theory

1153
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,680
does that mean that whatever drugs they

1154
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,880
develop are going to go straight to

1155
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,040
generic because they won't be able to

1156
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,200
patent or copyright it

1157
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
so when we're talking about drugs we're

1158
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,079
generally talking about patent law so a

1159
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,440
lot of the questions that come up in

1160
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,000
copyright law don't really apply um and

1161
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,520
i think that you can solve that problem

1162
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,280
in the patent world

1163
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,599
by uh having that human being who's

1164
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,200
sitting down and saying you know i think

1165
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,079
this is

1166
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,960
this is useful i think this is the this

1167
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,599
is the drug this is the genetic sequence

1168
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
this is the you know whatever that we're

1169
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,560
going to use and it's going to do great

1170
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,480
things because they've recognized the

1171
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,359
potential utility of that drug um so i

1172
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,440
think that's where the answer is it

1173
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,040
won't really upend things at all in the

1174
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,079
patent world but if if recognition is is

1175
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,599
the standard and i'm glad you kind of

1176
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,680
came back to that right if if i see

1177
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,240
someone doing something right uh like an

1178
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,960
invention or something like that but

1179
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,880
let's say they don't go to patent it or

1180
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,960
whatever i just see them doing it and

1181
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,280
then i write it up and then submit it

1182
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
right wouldn't that be the same thing as

1183
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,359
watching your computer do it recognizing

1184
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,760
it and then submitting it isn't isn't

1185
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
there an analogy there well except you

1186
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,520
like they would be the inventor right

1187
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,880
they did it first

1188
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,640
well right but the computer did it first

1189
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
i did not control that

1190
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,640
um

1191
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,920
all right yeah sorry

1192
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,800
hello thank you for your talk um

1193
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,599
in the publishing world i'm not a lawyer

1194
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,480
but

1195
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,680
if

1196
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,400
the

1197
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,880
publishing company takes a collection of

1198
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,400
essays and compiles it as a compilation

1199
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,160
i i think that's copyrightable um so

1200
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,839
if the

1201
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,960
if a human is sitting at dolly or dolly

1202
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,720
mini makes a prompt and then curates the

1203
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,920
dozens of garbage and says i think this

1204
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
one is actually worthwhile

1205
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,599
is

1206
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,079
do you think that act is

1207
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,400
copyrightable so so there are kind of

1208
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,480
there there's texture to that question

1209
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,359
right you've got the question of

1210
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,880
does the act of selecting one of these

1211
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,000
outputs

1212
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
make that output

1213
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,119
copyrightable and i don't think it does

1214
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,079
but

1215
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,319
potentially a collection of those

1216
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,800
outputs arranged in some creative way

1217
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,560
could be copyrightable because now

1218
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
you've inserted

1219
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,520
a human being's um

1220
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,880
creativity into the mix uh there's um

1221
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,200
down in the down in the uh

1222
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,680
vendor area we have with us a uh an

1223
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,520
artist who uses ai models as a starting

1224
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,400
point

1225
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,480
and then um his name is jonathan i

1226
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,560
believe uh and he's got some great work

1227
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,400
and you should go check it out um but

1228
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,640
the the fact that he

1229
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,280
takes that ai that initial ai bit and

1230
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,680
provides further processing on top of it

1231
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,119
makes it in my view definitely

1232
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,960
copyrightable because he's inserted his

1233
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,480
creativity there i don't i hope that

1234
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,839
answers your question thank you very

1235
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,000
much

1236
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,880
so this one's a bit wonky but uh within

1237
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,359
certain bounded areas uh you know ai has

1238
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,800
the ability to actually cover all

1239
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,359
possible outputs you know and so two

1240
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,280
artists actually covered every possible

1241
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,520
sequence of the eight note 12 beat

1242
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
melody using computer code and then

1243
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,079
tried to copyright all 68 billion

1244
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,119
outputs

1245
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,160
and i just want to know what your

1246
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,920
thoughts were on that because when we

1247
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,599
use computational

1248
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,560
power

1249
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,599
the uh

1250
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,200
man fighting a walrus you know if you

1251
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,119
turn that over to an ai and run it long

1252
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,400
enough you're going to cover every

1253
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,880
possible scenario there right yeah sure

1254
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,800
yeah well it's the infinite monkey again

1255
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,839
yeah and this was an infant monkey on 12

1256
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,280
whatever it was i'm not an artist right

1257
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
you don't need you don't need uh machine

1258
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,599
advanced machine learning technologies

1259
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,440
to do that you can just like brute force

1260
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,520
it and go through every possible output

1261
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,119
i would say they probably lack the

1262
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,319
creativity

1263
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,359
um

1264
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,040
that the modicum of creativity they've

1265
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,119
just collected a bunch of data there

1266
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
right um the the human act of

1267
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,760
composition is not about generating

1268
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,400
sequences of notes it's about that kind

1269
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,559
of intentional

1270
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,119
creative act which of course is very

1271
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,160
fuzzy um i do think it's bold and i

1272
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,400
respect the the gumption

1273
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,079
but i think that was their point is to

1274
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,480
say you know if you cover every possible

1275
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,960
output then you know i think their point

1276
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,400
was to have fun at the expense of the

1277
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,880
federal government which sounds great

1278
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,359
thank you very much

1279
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,000
in the 1950s there was uh the blacklist

1280
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,160
and a lot of very talented writers and

1281
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,920
authors and screenwriters were blocked

1282
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,160
from using their talents so they

1283
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
continued to do so anyway and wrote some

1284
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,599
wonderful things only they had

1285
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,839
intermediaries that took credit for the

1286
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,240
works later on decades later many of

1287
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,160
them were given credit officially and

1288
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,119
given

1289
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,359
you know awards for their work but

1290
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
do you think that if the courts were to

1291
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,920
rule that the computers could

1292
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,800
gain

1293
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
or could not gain this kind of

1294
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,800
protection that in order to you know use

1295
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
the inventions there would be people on

1296
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,800
an exclusive basis there would be people

1297
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,640
who would act as intermediaries and say

1298
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,960
yeah i did that and that might happen

1299
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
for a couple of decades until the law

1300
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,160
catches up

1301
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,440
i think that's a great question and i

1302
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,559
think that you're right that that's

1303
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,480
exactly what would happen if the law

1304
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,800
says your machine

1305
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,520
cannot own the copyright there's really

1306
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,599
nothing stopping a person from just

1307
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,960
pretending

1308
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,720
that they did it until you know

1309
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,640
eventually you

1310
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,880
have to litigate that and we start

1311
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,720
asking the question right because that's

1312
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,960
what would end up happening is if you

1313
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,800
know and this this is a series of

1314
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,680
hypotheticals now if

1315
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,760
the courts

1316
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,240
rest on the idea that a machine a pure

1317
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,160
machine output cannot be copyrighted

1318
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,040
and a human being steps in

1319
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,079
and

1320
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,319
claims falsely that they

1321
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,800
that their creativity was was a part of

1322
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,520
it

1323
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,280
then

1324
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
uh you would have to like when when we

1325
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,319
start litigating those lawsuits we would

1326
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,839
as a matter of course have to start

1327
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,440
investigating that and be like all right

1328
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,960
great well give us some other examples

1329
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,319
of stuff you've done tell us about your

1330
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,400
process and the jury would decide

1331
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,000
whether they're credible i think there's

1332
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,599
a better solution

1333
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,839
which is to take that machine output and

1334
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,760
put a thin layer of human creativity on

1335
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,720
top and that will turn it into something

1336
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,200
copyrightable even if the original

1337
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,160
output

1338
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,400
was not

1339
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,599
i actually want to follow up on that

1340
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,000
exact same thing what is

1341
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,760
the standard that exists for taking

1342
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,920
something that's not copyrightable

1343
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,599
how much creativity has to be put into

1344
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,480
that to make it copyrightable the word

1345
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,160
the the all the courts will tell you is

1346
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,839
a modicum of creativity and it's

1347
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,319
intended to be a very low bar but at

1348
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,559
least a non-zero bar right so you have

1349
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,880
to do something um

1350
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,119
uh something more than just you know

1351
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,359
collecting the data and and representing

1352
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,160
it in some natural way you have to exert

1353
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
some some thought so like one example

1354
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,680
that i always thought was kind of cool

1355
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,200
and this might be apocryphal i don't

1356
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,680
know but map companies run into this

1357
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,240
problem because map companies are taking

1358
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,640
existing data and representing it in a

1359
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,040
graphical form and so i've uh you know

1360
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,200
i've heard the story that map companies

1361
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
in order to establish their the

1362
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,680
copyright ability of their work will add

1363
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,880
cities that do not exist to maps to to

1364
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,520
add that element of human creativity and

1365
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
make their maps copyrightable

1366
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,880
yes

1367
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,359
uh back to you co-pilot

1368
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,960
uh i'm not sure if you're familiar with

1369
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,160
the

1370
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,000
software freedom conservancy's mailing

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,440
list um

1372
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
there's a group of people talking about

1373
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,400
the co-pilot issue yes meeting and

1374
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,559
publishing notes and discussing

1375
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,839
so uh

1376
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,680
there's the

1377
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,960
i guess the current

1378
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,319
current strategy is we're going to make

1379
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,720
our own

1380
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,119
machine learning model with with

1381
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,440
blackjack and copyleft

1382
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,280
and

1383
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,319
i don't know if you've been following

1384
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,280
this discussion but i wanted to know if

1385
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,000
what are your thoughts um can

1386
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,280
can a model have a

1387
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,559
license

1388
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:52,780
and

1389
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,160
[Music]

1390
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,040
uh

1391
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,440
control the the output

1392
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
of uh dictate the license of an output

1393
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,040
of them

1394
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,440
the model so you're saying can the owner

1395
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
of the model dictate how the output of

1396
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,920
the model is used correct

1397
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
i mean

1398
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,319
yeah it's a it's a end-user license

1399
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,520
agreement right you're using their

1400
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,040
software and they can

1401
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,440
they can in exchange for letting you use

1402
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,200
it um

1403
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,839
put some terms on how you use it right

1404
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,760
so

1405
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,800
yes

1406
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,760
um

1407
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,000
your your alternative is always to just

1408
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,599
not use their model

1409
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,119
right if you don't want to be bound by

1410
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,640
their terms that's a little bit

1411
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,720
different from saying that you know they

1412
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,599
own

1413
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,680
something that's not ownable right and

1414
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,440
so for example dali is trying to do

1415
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,839
exactly that where

1416
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,839
their terms of use say

1417
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,760
um we own

1418
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,160
the output of our model

1419
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,920
if we don't you have to if you own it

1420
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,000
you have to give it to us if we own it

1421
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,680
that's great you're allowed to use it

1422
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,160
for whatever purpose but we own it

1423
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,400
and so they're trying but they recognize

1424
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,880
they clearly understand that the

1425
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,839
the

1426
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,839
the boundaries are fuzzy right now for

1427
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,160
what ownership means here um

1428
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,720
thank you

1429
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,960
so just for timing purposes i see we're

1430
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,559
at 10 52.

1431
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,760
am i good okay go for it

1432
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,920
if i make a

1433
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,079
picture book a photo book yes out of the

1434
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,200
output of dolly creations

1435
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,400
uh

1436
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,040
can i publish it can i get paid for it

1437
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,359
so you're saying you take a bunch of raw

1438
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,960
dolly output

1439
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,200
put one on every page of a book call it

1440
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,480
a collection

1441
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,480
um

1442
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,480
i add a theme to it and yeah you've

1443
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,720
curated it yes um i don't know the

1444
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,880
answer to that uh you know at heart i'm

1445
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,800
a patent attorney and so there's a lot

1446
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
of copyright law that i just don't know

1447
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,760
um

1448
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,559
i don't know about the separate

1449
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,359
copyright ability of a collection of

1450
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,800
uncopyrightable things all right i don't

1451
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
know what level of creativity would be

1452
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,720
required so basically the question comes

1453
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,079
down to whether the judiciousness right

1454
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,640
the the the the selection process of the

1455
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,920
human

1456
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,319
qualifies as being a creative process

1457
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,920
and that's an a question i don't have an

1458
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,160
answer to

1459
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,640
all right and i think we have no more

1460
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,559
questions oh and and i'm out of time

1461
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,559
anyway so we are all done thank you very

minutes will be using cyber security

1465
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,400
automation to organize your cyber threat

1466
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,559
