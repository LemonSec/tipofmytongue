[Music]

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,520
let me introduce our next speaker

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
the pandemic plaguing us makes planning

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,479
problematic

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
most online collaboration tools have

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
security weak points be it application

11
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
vulnerabilities or willingness to give

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
data at the drop of a law enforcement

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
officer's hat

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
there is a better way though

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
peer-to-peer collaboration tools

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
please welcome holmes wilson

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
thank you

18
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,680
hi uh

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
my name is wilson i'm

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
a co-founder and now a board member of

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
the tech policy activism organization

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,240
fight for the future

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,079
which has made a really significant

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
impact over the years on tech policy

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
issues like online privacy internet

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
censorship the right to encrypt

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,840
net neutrality and limiting biometric

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
surveillance

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
so this talk relates to three problems i

30
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
think about way too much

31
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,000
the first is the problem of holding big

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,479
tech companies accountable

33
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
the second is russia's horrific invasion

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
of ukraine and the problem of fighting

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
authoritarianism

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
and the third is the pandemic

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
and how we can do sensitive work

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
together securely online

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
today i'll suggest a shift in our

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,720
thinking about software which that we

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
can make right now which i think can

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
help with each of these problems

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
holding big tech county companies

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
accountable helping activists fight

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,239
authoritarianism

46
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
and improving security for remote teams

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
doing sensitive work online

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
but first i have a rant

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
a rant that will hopefully turn into

50
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
something more constructive than a rant

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
my friends think the internet sucks and

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
this is bumming me out

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,720
so two years ago at hope 2020 i

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,599
attempted to answer this question of why

55
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
why do most of my friends think the

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
internet sucks

57
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
and also a related question of what can

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
i do to change it because it's bumming

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
me out

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
and i think the answer to the first

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
question was that the internet had

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
changed from being a tool for tearing

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,519
down on accountable power

64
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
with movements like occupy and the arab

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,959
spring

66
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
to being

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
unaccountable power itself in its own

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
right dominated by unaccountable tech

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,720
companies run by cringy celebrity

70
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
billionaires

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,799
so

72
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,400
when the internet looked like it was a

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,879
tool for challenging unaccountable power

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,640
people felt like it was on their side

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
and they liked it

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
but when big tech made the internet

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
start seeming like a new unaccountable

78
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
power in its own right people like the

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
majority of my friends

80
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
began to meet fear and mistrust and hate

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
it

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,239
so

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
how did this happen

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
i think it had something to do with the

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
cloud because both things seem to happen

86
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
around the same time

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
with the cloud software most people used

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,519
every day largely stopped working on its

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
own and

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
started being tethered to infrastructure

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
controlled by someone else

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
and we all know this story well

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
microsoft word gave way to google docs

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
email gave way to gmail

95
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,799
conversations that used to happen on

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
usenet mailing lists and forums

97
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
began happening on massive centrally

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
controlled platforms like facebook and

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
twitter

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
and even when apps didn't need

101
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
infrastructure and could easily run

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
without servers apple artificially

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
inserted themselves

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
in in their own infrastructure as a

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
gatekeeper with an app store to grab the

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
power and profits that came from

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,199
controlling what software users could

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,360
run

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
on an iphone even the simplest game

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
can't run without permission from big

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
tech we can't hold big tech accountable

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,280
because

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
we depend on their infrastructure way

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
too much

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
the medium that gave us the rise of

116
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,479
occupy wall street

117
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
started to look more like regular wall

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
street and after a while people noticed

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
and they thought that it sucked

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,039
that's i think part of the reason

121
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
but there's something more to the story

122
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,800
and to me it makes the whole thing even

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
sadder

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
because

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
we actually had and we still have a

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
great mechanism for holding big tech

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,199
companies accountable

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
but the tethering of our software to

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
servers undermined that mechanism

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
terribly the mechanism i'm talking about

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
is free software sometimes called open

132
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
source software

133
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
and free software is a mechanism for

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
holding software accountable that works

135
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
by guaranteeing four freedoms

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
the freedom to run software as we wish

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
the freedom to study and change it the

138
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
freedom to redistribute copies and the

139
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
freedom to distribute modified versions

140
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
i actually worked at the free software

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
foundation in 2009 and 2010 and i was

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
only there for a brief time but

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
i still think free software is probably

144
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
the clearest framework for thinking

145
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
about the intersection of politics and

146
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,360
software particularly power and software

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
and this architect articulation saved

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
the internet multiple times

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
in the darkest days of the microsoft

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
desktop monopoly when a lot of computing

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,120
looked like this

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
free software web browsers helped us

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
escape

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
and then again when media monopolies

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
tried to keep popular culture off the

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
internet free software file sharing apps

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
helped us escape

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
when apple nearly seized control of the

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
future of computing with the iphone free

160
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,639
software operating systems helped us

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
escape

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
and when you escaped to free software

163
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,280
you could feel it was on your side in a

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
way that doesn't happen that much with

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,199
software these days free software killer

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,759
apps like firefox and vlc and bittorrent

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,199
worked for you in a way that was really

168
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,479
palpable

169
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,680
you want to turn off all ads in your

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,639
browser

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,600
cool done said firefox

172
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
you think drm and video codecs are kind

173
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
of stupid and video should just work

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
cool so do we said vlc

175
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
you think copyright should recognize the

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
public's interest in building free

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
online libraries

178
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,479
bittorrent said do your thing and

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,840
largely we did

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,199
um and you know you want to run

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,720
bittorrent on your phone which is still

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
banned on ios

183
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
android said why of course

184
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
and why wouldn't it

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
when big tech made power plays against

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
us free software refused to participate

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
and how could it participate because if

188
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
it did someone would fork it take the

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
code put out a new version

190
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
and release something else which

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
rarely happened because the threat of a

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,919
fork made all of that

193
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
all those worst power plays that big

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,960
tech could play both taboo and pointless

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
a lot of people think of free software

196
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
as an ethical choice like something like

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
being vegan

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
um but actually i think it's more like

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
yeah we got the vegetarian haggis here

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
actually i think it's more like a union

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
because good unions can give all workers

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
more leverage not just workers in unions

203
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
by posing a credible threat of

204
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
successful revolt and by altering

205
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,800
societal norms

206
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
unions have this slogan i love which is

207
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
the folks that brought you the weekend

208
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
like unions made weekends normal

209
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,840
and in the same way the threat posed by

210
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
free software alternatives

211
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
and the way these alternatives raised

212
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
our expectations of how software should

213
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
behave held big tech accountable time

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,960
and time again over the history of the

215
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
internet

216
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
this is part of our history as a

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,780
movement

218
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,280
[Music]

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,879
this is the track that we want the

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,039
internet to be on as it grows

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,639
to be able to hold big tech companies

222
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
accountable and have an internet that

223
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
people

224
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
really feel is on their side

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,440
so

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
why isn't this accountability mechanism

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
of free software working in the age of

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,559
the cloud

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
i think there's a simple answer and the

230
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
answer is dependence on servers

231
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
for starters server dependence

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,720
fundamentally undermines free software's

233
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
for freedoms

234
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,440
the freedom to run software

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
only if you've got a server

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
the freedom to study and change it

237
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
not on someone else's server

238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
not legally anyway

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,040
the freedom to redistribute or

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
distribute changes

241
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
you can redistribute the code says free

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
software but the data and relationships

243
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,000
all live on the server

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
the free software foundation spotted

245
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,360
this threat of server dependence as the

246
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
cloud took off

247
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
calling out a thing it called

248
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
service as a software substitute an

249
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,480
awkward riff on software as a service

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,040
the business model the cloud

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
two perfect examples of service as a

252
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
software substitute were google docs and

253
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,360
gmail because they replaced things that

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
always that people had always done

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
locally on their own computers

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
like email clients and word processors

257
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
but the free software foundation

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
never said that server dependence was

259
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,279
always bad

260
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
after all the movement had always run

261
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
some software on servers for things like

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,480
email lists and code repos and bug

263
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
trackers

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
and

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
and requiring developers to change that

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,279
when the technical path to doing so was

267
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
still so untested was a bridge too far

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
even for the free software foundation

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,959
in 2010 when i was a campaigner there i

270
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
thought this was an inconsistency and a

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
mistake and i think the past decade has

272
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
showed i was probably right

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,120
one great example of how server

274
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
dependence weakened free software is a

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,920
website we all know and love or maybe we

276
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
don't love it but the the front page of

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,120
the internet read it

278
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
at the free software foundation we had

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
to boycott a lot of popular services

280
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
when campaigning but we had a green

281
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
light to use reddit because reddit was

282
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
free software

283
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
that meant that in theory if reddit did

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
something its users didn't like users

285
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,560
could fork its code start their own

286
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
reddit and even if an even if it never

287
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
came to that use the threat of being

288
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
able to do so to hold reddit accountable

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
in theory

290
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
however in practice

291
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,959
forking reddit would leave you with

292
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,040
nothing more than an empty website

293
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
because all the data and relationships

294
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
that made reddit what it was

295
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
lived on company run servers and

296
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
meanwhile the work of scaling reddit to

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
hundreds of millions of users had made

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
its code base so complex and so

299
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,880
difficult to maintain even for reddit

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
itself that it had become less and less

301
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
useful to anyone else

302
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
this is exactly what reddit said in 2017

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
when they announced that they would no

304
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
longer be releasing reddit's code base

305
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
as free software

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
and few cared because reddit was right

307
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
when software depended on servers free

308
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,399
software's four freedoms

309
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
and the power to fork only got you a

310
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,839
complex hard to maintain empty

311
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,920
website reddit shows that if we care

312
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
about holding popular services

313
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
accountable we really really need to

314
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
leave the server behind

315
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
even when that seems hard or impossible

316
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
and even for things that we've always

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,440
traditionally done using servers

318
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
to see more evidence that servers are a

319
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
problem for free software holding

320
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
bigtech accountable we can compare areas

321
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,279
of software that are dependent on

322
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
servers to areas of software that are

323
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
not

324
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
my favorite place to start is developer

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
tools because it's both

326
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,279
developer tools give us the closest

327
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
thing we're going to get to a real pure

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
experiment

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
on one side we have tools that run on

330
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
devices developers control like ides

331
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
libraries languages desktop operating

332
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
systems and server operating systems

333
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
here free software is extremely strong

334
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,639
and developers have a huge amount of

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
power to hold big tech accountable

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
free software is such an integral part

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
of every developer's day that it's hard

338
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
to even imagine a world without it no

339
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
one's going to sign a license agreement

340
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,120
to use some library they just found

341
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
according to the latest stack overflow

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
survey 40 percent of free of developers

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
or professional developers use free

344
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
software operating systems

345
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,279
and when big tech offers free software

346
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
languages to ant developer tools like co

347
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,519
like go or kubernetes or flutter or

348
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
react or jest

349
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,120
pi torch

350
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
these rarely if ever raise the

351
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
accountability problems that big tech is

352
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
famous for

353
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
tech ceos are not getting dragged in

354
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
front of congress dragged over the goals

355
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
over react and go

356
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
though that would be kind of weird

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,560
on the other side when we look at

358
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
developer tools that require or benefit

359
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,519
from central servers like github

360
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,720
cloudflare

361
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
amazon web services or app stores

362
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
free software is much weaker

363
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,519
and the picture changes completely

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
for one thing when developer tools

365
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
depend on servers big tech can kick

366
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
developers off these tools

367
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,760
and what can a developer do about that

368
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
servers are a censorship problem the

369
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
mere fact that there is a free app store

370
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,399
called

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
f droid or a free github alternative

372
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,360
called git lab both good things does not

373
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,639
solve a developer's problem when they

374
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,760
are kicked off

375
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
app stores or

376
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
or github because those services have a

377
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
critical mass of data and users that

378
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,519
make them especially useful and as we

379
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,279
saw with the example of reddit

380
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,800
developers can't just fork those just

381
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,839
because you can work the code

382
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,199
servers are a lock-in problem

383
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,320
there are tons of free software

384
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,160
replacements for popular server-based

385
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
tools and many are quite good but most

386
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,839
teams don't use them because most people

387
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,519
don't want to be the one

388
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
who's the single point of failure if

389
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,480
something breaks

390
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
for dozens or hundreds or maybe millions

391
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
of people

392
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,160
open source volunteers especially don't

393
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
want to be the single point of failure

394
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
as a volunteer

395
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
do you want to be on pagerduty and get

396
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,040
that call in the middle of the night

397
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
with that special ringtone when the

398
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
server breaks

399
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
do you want to take your laptop to a

400
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
party to every party you go to in case

401
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
something breaks and never leaves cell

402
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
phone range

403
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
signal creator moxie marlin spike talks

404
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
about uh this being his life for years

405
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
nobody wants that life as a volunteer or

406
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
a few people do i should say

407
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,399
servers are a volunteer problem

408
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
and yes the classic open source business

409
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
model is to provide a hosted version

410
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
supported by a paid team so you don't

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
have to rely on volunteers to do devops

412
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,279
but gmail is free and instagram is free

413
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,720
and wall street and big tech can

414
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
subsidize these products for a decade or

415
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
more

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
until they can profit from dominance so

417
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
if you're up against a free product from

418
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,000
big tech

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,839
and you have server bills

420
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
servers are a competitiveness problem

421
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
again with developers we have the same

422
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,000
market and the same customer developers

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
our customer is highly technical and

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,079
empowered and fully capable of running

425
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
their own server far more than the

426
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
typical person is

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
and yet as soon as servers are in the

428
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,079
mix big text power shoots up and the

429
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,759
ability to hold big tech accountable

430
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
falls off a cliff

431
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,239
servers are a problem

432
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
moving beyond developer tools to other

433
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,199
areas of software we see that in areas

434
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
without server dependence we have some

435
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
strong free software alternatives and we

436
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
do not see big tech at its worst

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
we have web browsers media players

438
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
document readers

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
desktop operating systems and mobile

440
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,959
operating systems minus the server

441
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,600
dependent bits in the app source

442
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
these aren't perfect utopias but despite

443
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
dominance by big tech we don't see high

444
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,959
prices almost any advertising or massive

445
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
data collection

446
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,800
conversely in areas of software that

447
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
depend on free server on on servers such

448
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,199
as social media

449
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,079
search

450
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
e-commerce or collaboration tools we see

451
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
big tech at its worst

452
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
we see high prices the most heavy-handed

453
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,880
and problematic forms of advertising and

454
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,079
few privacy protections

455
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
servers are just a problem

456
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
because our inability to hold big tech

457
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
accountable stems from a simple

458
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,399
relationship

459
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
server dependence weakens free software

460
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
and the longer we go without realizing

461
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,519
it the longer we'll be stuck without a

462
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,519
solution

463
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
so how do we replace servers

464
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
if you're a professional developer

465
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,839
you're probably

466
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,440
thinking wait a second there were huge

467
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
advantages when we switched to

468
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
developing things on servers and

469
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
decentralized systems are really tricky

470
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,440
and i want to validate that completely

471
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
yes cloud made building software easier

472
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,359
in so many ways yes handling complex

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,919
data across many users without a server

474
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
can be very daunting so to validate your

475
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
doubts and just bring everybody up to

476
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
speed on this

477
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,640
i'm going to show a huge list of reasons

478
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,959
why it's true

479
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,359
i'm not even going to read all of them

480
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,480
there's so many

481
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,959
and this list is not exhaustive i'll

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,359
just say yes it's daunting

483
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
but building the world we want takes

484
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
work so if the evidence says that

485
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
servers are a problem we have to roll up

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,399
our sleeves and do that work

487
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
but how do we replace servers

488
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
so i have a trick

489
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
and the trick is

490
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559
to find broad categories of software

491
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,160
where the difficulty of eliminating the

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,679
server is unusually low and the

493
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,440
benefits of eliminating the server are

494
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
unusually high

495
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
and then you can attack those categories

496
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
once you find them

497
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
i believe team collaboration is one such

498
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,039
category

499
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
apps like slack

500
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
discord google docs github trello

501
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,640
basecamp figma miro asana and so on

502
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
the benefits of alert of eliminating

503
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,360
servers for these apps

504
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
is unusually high

505
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
because these apps are so central to our

506
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
creative and professional lives and

507
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,360
because the privacy and security

508
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,480
properties

509
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
of these apps can be so essential

510
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
especially for remote teams doing

511
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
sensitive work in a pandemic

512
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,840
and for activists resisting

513
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
authoritarianism

514
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
the difficulty of eliminating the server

515
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,039
here is relatively low because these

516
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,720
apps sync limited sized state

517
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
and they do it in private networks

518
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,039
which

519
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
progress in both tor and peer-to-peer

520
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
stocks has made a lot less difficult

521
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,919
than it used to be

522
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
okay so how do i know this

523
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
because my collaborators and i went and

524
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
did it

525
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400
we built a thing that i think

526
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
proves that open societies can bring

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
privacy and accountability to the broad

528
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
category of team collaboration tools

529
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
built a slack alternative that does not

530
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
use servers

531
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,760
and it's missing a ton of features

532
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,000
and it's not audited yet so please don't

533
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
use it for anything critical

534
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
but it's exciting that this is even

535
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
possible because if it's possible for us

536
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
to build a slack alternative it's

537
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,080
possible to build

538
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
alternatives that are not dependent on

539
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
servers to a broad range of

540
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
collaboration tools

541
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,400
it's called quiet

542
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
and i'm going to show it to you now

543
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
all right

544
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
this is the terrifying part

545
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,960
um so i'm over here

546
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
and

547
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,799
cool

548
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,240
oops

549
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
there

550
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,640
all right so um here i have uh three

551
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,919
apps running in my computer three

552
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
versions instances of quiet they're all

553
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
connected out through tor

554
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,760
i can say hi

555
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
and the message is sent to everyone else

556
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
oops i'm in the wrong channel here you

557
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
can see the message is sent i can say hi

558
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
back from bob

559
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
and the message appears all the clients

560
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
sync state with each other

561
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,080
now let's see i can send a gif

562
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
um

563
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,480
it's this one

564
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
yep

565
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,440
all right so i'll send that gif

566
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
and it appears

567
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,200
on everyone's clients

568
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
and um yeah some people who work on this

569
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
app with me are here today um let's see

570
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,559
uh victor actually worked on some of the

571
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,880
file sending stuff so

572
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
yeah how's it going

573
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,120
i think yeah i think other people are

574
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
online in this chat

575
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,919
oh yeah there's victor cool uh emilia

576
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
where is amelia there's amelia um does

577
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,440
the the everything look good out there

578
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
like

579
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
pretty how's the talk going so far

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
okay great um

581
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
so

582
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
cool yeah and now i'm gonna do something

583
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,039
that is really hard to do in any

584
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,120
centralized or impossible to do in most

585
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,799
centralized messaging apps especially

586
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
the free ones and that is i'm going to

587
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,720
send a very large file

588
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
um

589
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
let's see i'm going to send this

590
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
three gigabyte

591
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,280
ubuntu iso to everybody

592
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
and uh

593
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
hope this works

594
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
oh no it didn't well um

595
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,039
demo effect uh but um

596
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,799
the principle here well maybe it will

597
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
maybe it's just through an error

598
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,280
anyway the principle here is that

599
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,799
when um

600
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,120
when apps depend on a server

601
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,280
they have to limit the server they have

602
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
to limit file size because the server is

603
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
a shared resource but when users bring

604
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,240
their own

605
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
infrastructure to the party you don't

606
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,679
really have to limit people in that way

607
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,039
so it's a cool illustration of how

608
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,679
freedom of how servers enhance software

609
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,240
freedom in this particular case

610
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,039
um

611
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,600
but yeah what i think is doing now is

612
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,840
it's hashing the file and then once it

613
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,280
hashes the file it will send a link to

614
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
everybody and they will have the option

615
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,559
of downloading it

616
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,000
so

617
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
let's see oh yeah and i'll show you what

618
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,919
it's like to invite someone the inviting

619
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
process is actually quite a bit like

620
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
it's quite a bit like slack

621
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
so

622
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,520
i think it's this one

623
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,400
yeah

624
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
okay so um i have a new user here that

625
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,080
we want to invite they've just spun up

626
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,679
an instance of quiet this could be you

627
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,360
joining right now

628
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,799
i will

629
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,039
get them an invite link

630
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,520
copy it to my clipboard

631
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
paste it in here

632
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,480
and continue

633
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,360
and i'll choose a username

634
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
charles

635
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,799
and this often takes a bit

636
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
and i'm not sure if it will work right

637
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
now just because of

638
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
like

639
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
timing and network issues and stuff but

640
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,880
this client is making a connection over

641
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,320
tor to the owner's device over here and

642
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
we'll go through an onboarding process

643
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,640
and should be able to join

644
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
one issue is that if tor times out the

645
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
first time it has to try again a couple

646
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
times but

647
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
as you can see the people are in the

648
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,679
channel are still mostly connected to

649
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,440
each other

650
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
this should still be working

651
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,679
yep and

652
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,039
this guy's dead because i sent this

653
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,360
giant file all right so i'm going to go

654
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
back to my talk

655
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
that's the demo

656
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,158
and

657
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
let's see

658
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
so

659
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
i'm in here

660
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
and here

661
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
and here

662
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
there

663
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,679
cool

664
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,279
so here's how it works

665
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
i said syncing limited amounts of state

666
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
in private networks was getting easier

667
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
to do so now i'll explain why

668
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
first the invitation code i sent

669
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
in my demo to invite a new user is an

670
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
onion address that points to an

671
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
onboarding api running on the owner's

672
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
device

673
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,960
an onion address is an address within

674
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
the tor network that is unguessable

675
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
lasts forever or as long as we need it

676
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
and

677
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
all data exchanged with an onion address

678
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,640
is end-to-end encrypted by tor

679
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
onboarding and quiet is complicated

680
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
under their hood so i'll skip that but

681
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,240
you can ask questions about it

682
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
but when onboarding is complete we have

683
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
a closed network of users all of whom

684
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,840
are members of the same community who

685
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
know each other's onion addresses and

686
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
public keys who can therefore all

687
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
connect to each other over tor

688
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,039
each with a signed certificate from the

689
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,919
owner with their username a public key

690
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,320
and that's it that's our closed private

691
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
network

692
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,840
everyone is connected privately over tor

693
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,720
so

694
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
now how do we sync state

695
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
to sync state we use a crdt called orbit

696
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,279
db which is built on a peer-to-peer

697
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,840
protocol called ipfs which we forced to

698
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
use tor and only connect to the onion

699
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,720
addresses of other community members in

700
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
our closed network

701
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,440
crdt stands for conflict-free replicated

702
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
data type crdts can merge state changes

703
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
between a network of nodes with eventual

704
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
consistency meaning that no matter what

705
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
changes on any node all nodes will

706
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,960
eventually sync to the same state

707
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
orbit db is fairly unusual among crdts

708
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,279
and that it comes with all of the

709
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,039
necessary peer-to-peer parts built in

710
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,840
for sharing data

711
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,960
when someone sends a message orbitp adds

712
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
that message to its local state

713
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,279
calculates a hash of its new state

714
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,960
broadcast this hash to other members

715
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
using a gossip protocol that's part of

716
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
ipfs

717
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
and

718
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
a gossip protocol is often called an

719
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,159
epidemic protocol which

720
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,000
because it spreads peers the way it

721
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
works is it spreads data from peers to

722
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,880
their neighbors their neighbors and so

723
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
on until everybody gets the data

724
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,760
here's a really simple visualization of

725
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,320
that this person sends a hash they send

726
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
it to their neighbors they send it to

727
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
their neighbors

728
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
until everyone has it

729
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
on the receiving side whenever orbitdb

730
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,279
sees a hash it is not seen yet it knows

731
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,600
there is data it has not yet synced

732
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
so it uses this hash like a link to

733
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,960
fetch

734
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
that data using ipfs and then when it

735
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,080
gets that any data it links to and so on

736
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,760
until it has synced everything there is

737
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
to sync this is a little bit like how

738
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,919
git works

739
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,039
for sending files quiet also uses ipfs

740
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,000
and ipfs splits files into blocks this

741
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
is the this is what we used when we sent

742
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
that gif

743
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
it splits files into blocks and fetches

744
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,039
blocks from peers that have them like

745
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,400
bittorrent does

746
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
and of course we need to introduce some

747
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,679
limit on the number of messages and

748
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
especially files otherwise our state

749
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,120
will grow and grow until it's too big to

750
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,799
fit on a single device and then we

751
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,120
violated the constraint of

752
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,679
syncing limited amounts of state

753
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,520
one really great way to limit state and

754
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,600
privacy tools is to do times deletion

755
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
because then it's a feature and not a

756
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
bug time deletion protects you in the

757
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
case of a device being compromised or

758
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,600
sees and it also limits our state size

759
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,520
quiet uses electron and react on desktop

760
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
react native on mobile and underneath

761
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
all that on all platforms we use redux

762
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
and node.js with orbitdb and the

763
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,559
javascript

764
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,720
implementation of ipfs

765
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
and then underneath all that there's the

766
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
tor binary

767
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,679
so you could probably imagine a lot of

768
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,840
the friction here

769
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,960
is just getting all these pieces to work

770
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,399
together

771
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
but that's the part that can get easier

772
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,399
and easier as the tools and libraries

773
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,360
improve

774
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
and i think that with enough

775
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
investment in libraries and tooling we

776
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,559
can get to a point where you could build

777
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,080
something like this in a weekend

778
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,639
hackathon

779
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
so

780
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
one question is okay this works for a

781
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
chat of a few people but would it work

782
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
for a team of 100 or a conference like

783
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,440
hope

784
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,120
the front end is still a little slow so

785
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,039
we ran some performance tests on our

786
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,760
underlying stack

787
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,399
this was a test we ran of

788
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,520
messages per second we sent 100 messages

789
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,399
in

790
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,840
five separate tests at 1 5 10 20 and 50

791
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,760
messages per second the results are

792
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,360
actually pretty random um it's some

793
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,679
interaction between torah and orbit tv

794
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,360
but the meaningful thing here is that

795
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
the average is that when we sent these

796
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,360
hundred messages average latency is well

797
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
under two seconds

798
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,600
even at five messages per second

799
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,279
and

800
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,320
um

801
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,720
and then the the max stays reasonable

802
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
under four seconds

803
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
and then another question would be is it

804
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,520
still fast when a lot of users join here

805
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,600
we ran a test with 100 users and there

806
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
was a problem

807
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,520
you can see delivery time of messages

808
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,399
spike in the upper 20 of users up to

809
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,080
unacceptable numbers this is the max not

810
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,799
the average the average is much better

811
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,240
we don't think this is really a

812
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
scalability problem inherently we think

813
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,799
it's more just a bug with how we're

814
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
using ipfs because it doesn't seem to

815
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
vary that much with the size of the

816
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
community

817
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,080
but it did mess up our test a little bit

818
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,760
and then the last thing is we tried to

819
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,159
simulate just this question of well okay

820
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,240
is tore the bottleneck here and we did

821
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
that by connecting five users in a chain

822
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,919
to simulate number of hops out in a in a

823
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,720
larger gossip network

824
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
and messages still arrive pretty fast in

825
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,120
this case you can see

826
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
four hops out

827
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,159
is that top line and we're still under

828
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,440
two

829
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,120
seconds for the most part except for

830
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
that one spike

831
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,679
so you know this simulates at least the

832
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,240
level of like data moving across to

833
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
across peers in the tor network this

834
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
simulates a group of i think around a

835
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
thousand users if my math is right

836
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,399
so what about mobile

837
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,600
we haven't done performance tests on

838
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,840
mobile yet we have a proof of concept it

839
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,520
works in our in our pockets we've tried

840
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
it um but the main issue with mobile is

841
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
that push notifications will still

842
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
require

843
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
a server in some way

844
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,279
so we have a stack that

845
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,000
lets us pretty much eliminate servers

846
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
but how meaningful are its security and

847
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,640
privacy properties to activists and

848
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,440
others doing sensitive work

849
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
before we built quiet we conducted 18

850
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
user interviews with activists

851
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,720
journalists and security experts that

852
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
advise both activists and journalists

853
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
the most important security requirements

854
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
that this re-identified were usability

855
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,960
end-to-end encryption time to deletion

856
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,399
and resistance to account credential

857
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,600
phishing

858
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
neither users nor security experts

859
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
mention specific properties of

860
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,559
encryption like forward or backward

861
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,440
secrecy as requirements

862
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,279
we believe that quiet's design meets

863
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,640
these requirements

864
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,120
messages are end-to-end encrypted by tor

865
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,279
metadata is protected by tor

866
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,600
there are no passwords to phish

867
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,320
timed deletion is not implemented yet

868
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,919
but it's planned

869
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,679
and possible

870
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,679
and users do not reveal email addresses

871
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,200
phone numbers or even ip addresses

872
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,559
the fact that signal reveals phone

873
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,840
numbers was

874
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,919
the main complaint about signal from the

875
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
experts and users we interviewed

876
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,519
of course we have not solved any of the

877
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,440
threats of supply chain attacks attacks

878
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
on update servers endpoint attacks

879
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,559
timing attacks on tor censorship of tor

880
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,240
and so on and so on all of these were

881
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
main threats but they're similar or

882
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,760
bigger problems in the centralized world

883
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,679
so now i'm going to do a quick rapid

884
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,240
fire run of related work i'm just going

885
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,559
to wonder if i can get a time check oh

886
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,399
cool so we have some time all right

887
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,080
so first um

888
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,640
it's useful to draw the contrast with

889
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,279
signal and matrix signal reduces the

890
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,840
server's power by using encryption

891
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,519
limited data retention and locally

892
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,000
stored contacts but servers and signal

893
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,919
are still very are still very powerful

894
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,840
and they're very much a point of failure

895
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
and while phone numbers do decentralize

896
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,320
the social graph they're a huge gift to

897
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
anyone who's able to seize an activist's

898
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,399
phone right because then they have

899
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,760
access to all their contacts everyone

900
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,880
they've communicated with in signal

901
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
matrix also uses encryption and it uses

902
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,600
federation which means anyone can run a

903
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
server servers are interconnected and it

904
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
can work great for organizations that

905
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
run their own servers

906
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,919
but the thing with federation is that we

907
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,080
have an example of federation in email

908
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,480
and gmail shows how federation can still

909
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
give big tech tons of power over most

910
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,559
users and federated systems leak

911
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,279
metadata even worse in some cases than

912
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,360
centralized ones

913
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,600
so next are some projects that use tor

914
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
to protect metadata and

915
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
reduce server dependence

916
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
ricochet refresh uses tor onion

917
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
addresses to connect users one to one

918
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
and does not do group messaging as far

919
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
as i know yet

920
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,919
kutch works like ricochet refresh but

921
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,840
for group messaging it uses ephemeral

922
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
servers that are untrusted ephemeral and

923
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
easy to run and learn almost nothing

924
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,799
about users but it still needs servers

925
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,480
federation is the worst of all worlds is

926
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,559
a must read on the issues of federation

927
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,120
by security expert and cat kutch

928
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
creator sarah jamie lewis

929
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
breyer is a project that is awesome it

930
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,360
uses crdt syncing well

931
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
not exactly cgt but something like a

932
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,799
crdt over tor like quiet but

933
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,399
in briar you can join a group with

934
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,799
someone without ever letting them

935
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,039
connect to you directly not even over

936
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,000
tor

937
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
that's something you can't do in quiet

938
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
and the difference between these two

939
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
approaches contains some really

940
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,039
interesting usability trade-offs

941
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
it also means briar works for users who

942
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,560
want to stay off the internet completely

943
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,159
connecting over bluetooth or local

944
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,320
network only

945
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,520
the session

946
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
attempts metadata protection without tor

947
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,599
by using onion routing servers paid in

948
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,359
its own cryptocurrency

949
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,040
because they're paid these servers can

950
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
also store messages for offline users

951
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,760
okay next comes some approaches that do

952
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,599
not attempt to protect metadata but are

953
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,000
still worthy of a mention

954
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
birdie like briar allows for chat over

955
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,918
bluetooth and local networks as well as

956
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,000
over the regular internet and like quiet

957
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,399
it uses ipfs and orbitdb

958
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,239
cabal is functionally very similar to

959
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
quiet and uses hypercore which is

960
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,480
analogous to ipfs

961
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,560
pinecone is an effort by matrix to go

962
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,918
full peer-to-peer and this would be a

963
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,879
game changer if it happened um but pine

964
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,320
cone is still really minimal and doesn't

965
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,399
address things like offline message

966
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,599
delivery or metadata protection

967
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,000
pine cone is almost like a faster tor

968
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
but without any metadata protection it's

969
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,280
just an overlay network for connecting

970
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,599
nodes on the internet

971
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,920
ether with an a is a peer-to-peer reddit

972
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,599
that attempts to tackle spam and let

973
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,119
communities elect moderators using a

974
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,280
bespoke peer-to-peer stack

975
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
secure scuttlebutt is a peer-to-peer

976
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
protocol for syncing individual status

977
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
updates like in a social network that

978
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
uses volunteer run servers and for pure

979
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,200
discovery and offline storage

980
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,119
radical is a peer-to-peer replacement

981
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,800
for github using volunteer always-on

982
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,040
nodes inspired by secure scuttlebutt and

983
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
a syncing algorithm based on git

984
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
so next are some just general important

985
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,640
parts of the movement

986
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,320
for server independence that i'll run

987
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
through really quickly

988
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
this essay local first software your own

989
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
data in spite of the cloud is a slightly

990
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,000
less radical call to action than the one

991
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,280
i just gave because they're not talking

992
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,839
about eliminating servers completely

993
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,680
clatman martin klepman is one of the

994
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
authors of this essay and has

995
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
co-authored a paper on seemingly every

996
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
major theme in this space

997
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,880
auto merge is his project

998
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,320
mix nats are probably the future of

999
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,839
anonymity since they're resistant to the

1000
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,440
traffic analysis attacks that work on

1001
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
tor but they struggle to be fast enough

1002
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
for things like chat

1003
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,520
lupix is the mix night paper to re paper

1004
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
to read if you're interested and nim

1005
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
tries to be faster and more scalable

1006
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,560
than lupix by compensating nodes in

1007
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,839
cryptocurrency and making other

1008
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,280
improvements

1009
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,880
roller coaster is the paper i found when

1010
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
googling someone whether someone had

1011
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
tackled this question of group messaging

1012
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,800
and group interaction in a mixnet and

1013
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,200
it's co-authored by martin clement so he

1014
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,400
has papers on everything in the space

1015
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
this library local first auth explores

1016
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,480
all the minutia of access control in a

1017
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
decentralized network

1018
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,800
braid is an effort to make state syncing

1019
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,440
an internet standard and the brain

1020
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,960
meetings end up being a cool cluster of

1021
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
crdt and peer-to-peer research folk

1022
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
redwood is a stack built on braid that

1023
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,880
has its own demo chat app

1024
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,160
and

1025
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,040
conics is a paper on how to give people

1026
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
secure global user names without a

1027
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,880
blockchain that can't be impersonated or

1028
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
taken away this is i think the one thing

1029
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
it's probably worth using servers for

1030
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,400
and we're gonna where we're probably

1031
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,839
going to remain server dependent for a

1032
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,599
while

1033
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,960
so to give this a little more structure

1034
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,320
here's a subjective attempt i made to

1035
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
categorize these projects on a scale of

1036
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,560
server dependence and there's some

1037
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,960
really difficult comparisons here and

1038
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
the scale obviously is totally

1039
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,560
subjective but um

1040
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,640
you know this is i i think it's still

1041
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,200
helpful and meaningful um

1042
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,440
one question is whether using tor counts

1043
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
as using a server and i think it doesn't

1044
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
because of tor's robustness and tourist

1045
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,839
scalability

1046
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,760
i'm sorry robustness scalability and

1047
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,640
neutrality too

1048
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,800
okay so

1049
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,119
in conclusion

1050
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,560
i think there are moments in the history

1051
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,079
of the free software movement where a

1052
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,720
clear common goal emerges

1053
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,359
the parallel pushes in the 1980s by the

1054
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,359
gnu project and linus torvalds to build

1055
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
a complete free software operating

1056
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
system was one such moment

1057
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,640
and the push in the late 1990s for a

1058
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
modern free software desktop

1059
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
was another

1060
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,480
i believe we're staring at yet another

1061
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,599
such moment

1062
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,119
one where we can

1063
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,800
rebuild collaboration tools without

1064
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,640
servers

1065
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
so that free software can once again

1066
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,640
hold big big tech accountable as it

1067
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
always has

1068
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,760
and give activists fighting

1069
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,920
authoritarianism and anyone doing

1070
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,320
sensitive work remotely in the pandemic

1071
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,079
meaningful privacy and security features

1072
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
that they currently lack

1073
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,240
so

1074
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
this is us we really need your help and

1075
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,680
the number one thing this movement needs

1076
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
is real groups of people ready to try

1077
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,839
out these tools

1078
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,880
how am i doing for time

1079
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,960
okay yeah we just we need people to try

1080
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
out our tools because projects likes are

1081
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,240
like ours the first way they fail is

1082
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,079
they don't find a niche and the thing

1083
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,359
that would change everything for our

1084
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,560
development process would be to have

1085
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
three or five groups of people using

1086
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,320
quiet every day as we do telling us what

1087
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
they need so that we can build it

1088
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
if we could just find one group of

1089
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,760
people like that today that would be a

1090
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
huge deal for us

1091
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
so if you if that's you or you can think

1092
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,800
of someone who it might be that would be

1093
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,240
super helpful and please approach me

1094
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
online or after the talk ideally you'd

1095
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
have some reason to care about privacy

1096
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,599
and security but also either be able to

1097
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,400
understand and evaluate uh really

1098
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
unaudited software like quiet and

1099
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
understand the risks about that or

1100
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,839
your privacy and security needs would be

1101
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,359
very far from anything serious or

1102
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,440
critical

1103
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
if you're interested in making technical

1104
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,480
progress on these tools the quiet team

1105
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
and i can help get you oriented on the

1106
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
different efforts in the space to help

1107
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,480
see where you can best plug in

1108
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
also just quickly some acknowledgements

1109
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
and gratitude to guillain marseau lisa

1110
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,560
larochel and ying chang for their

1111
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760
feedback on this talk as well as

1112
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,240
everybody in the quiet team

1113
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,760
well i think we can move to questions

1114
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,839
now

1115
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,040
thank you and if anyone has any

1116
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
questions please line up here behind the

1117
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
mic

1118
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,240
uh quick question from online are the

1119
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
slides going to be online

1120
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
um

1121
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
yes i can post them to twitter later

1122
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
today and so you can get the references

1123
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,160
to those other projects

1124
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
hey thanks for the talk really great um

1125
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
i'm curious to

1126
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,370
hear some on how you envision

1127
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,599
[Music]

1128
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,280
moderation will work in these

1129
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,359
decentralized spaces both

1130
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,560
for like content that might be

1131
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,119
um you know crafted to push people out

1132
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,119
of them or um

1133
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,960
you know

1134
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,560
combating that's like civil attacks or

1135
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,599
any sort of identity flooding um you

1136
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,599
know if you send out a invite and then

1137
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,200
500 people jump in and then your

1138
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,040
community's ruined so i'm just curious

1139
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,960
like the ideas around

1140
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,440
how to manage that when there's no

1141
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,599
central authority dealing with it

1142
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,000
yeah well um well you know in my talk i

1143
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
said

1144
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
the the trick

1145
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
that makes

1146
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,400
collaboration tools a good place to

1147
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,760
start is that

1148
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
there are limited size state enclosed

1149
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
networks

1150
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
right and that closed networks thing is

1151
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,000
important not just for the technical

1152
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,640
layer but also for the social

1153
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,079
layer for dealing with social problems

1154
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,760
like moderation and i suppose

1155
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,200
civil resistance becomes a technical

1156
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,319
problem too

1157
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,800
so if we're thinking about open networks

1158
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,640
that anyone can join

1159
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
um that's a much harder problem

1160
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
and it's one we don't have to solve just

1161
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
yet but if we're thinking about closed

1162
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,960
networks where there is someone who has

1163
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,800
the power to let people in selectively

1164
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,040
to kick people out and also to appoint

1165
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,520
moderators you know we can do the whole

1166
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
we can do everything that a moderation

1167
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,720
stack can do

1168
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
within this framework i mean we haven't

1169
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
done it yet but you can shadow ban

1170
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
people you can hide posts you can post a

1171
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
code of conduct you can have you can

1172
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,520
appoint moderators to enforce the code

1173
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,960
of conduct

1174
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,480
you could even potentially let users

1175
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,160
fork the community if

1176
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,440
they think the moderators are not

1177
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,760
adequately enforcing the code of conduct

1178
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,920
you can do content warnings the whole

1179
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,880
thing

1180
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,720
the one question you had about

1181
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,160
what if a flood of people comes in from

1182
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,520
an invite link

1183
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,960
you can have a feature for that i mean

1184
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
the invite link is not itself giving

1185
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,800
people access the invite link is just

1186
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,280
a connection to the owner's

1187
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,839
onboarding api they don't have access to

1188
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,599
the internal network at that point so

1189
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,839
the onboarding api can do what it wants

1190
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,760
to say okay only 10 people from this

1191
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
invite link or

1192
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,880
or i could also roll back all those

1193
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,119
invites if i wanted to later

1194
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,720
um the one thing i think i should say

1195
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,880
just to fully answer your question is

1196
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
we this system systems like these cannot

1197
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
stop a bunch of people coming together

1198
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,640
consensually happily to do something

1199
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,560
that is bad for the rest of society and

1200
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,480
for that i think you need richer social

1201
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
norms and potentially in the worst cases

1202
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,920
law enforcement

1203
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,839
thank

1204
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,560
you

1205
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,640
i have another question from online this

1206
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
question is from graylight

1207
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,720
did the deploy did the delay in

1208
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,839
deploying ipv6 and the quote original

1209
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,280
sin of nat

1210
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,880
contribute to the centralization of

1211
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,800
servers or would the business interests

1212
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,480
of big tech have done this just as

1213
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,319
quickly regardless

1214
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:02,670
um

1215
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,839
[Music]

1216
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,520
well if you think of that slide that's a

1217
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,359
super good question

1218
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,920
if you think of that slide

1219
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
of all of the reasons why servers are

1220
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,599
helpful

1221
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,680
i mean only a few of those are related

1222
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,040
to

1223
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,240
the problems of not being able to

1224
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,560
connect two peers directly because of

1225
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,720
the delayed ipv6 or because of that so

1226
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,160
just the question is referring to the

1227
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,280
problem of like you have two peers on

1228
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,200
the internet how do you connect them and

1229
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
that turns out to not be a trivial

1230
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,800
problem tor actually makes it a pretty

1231
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,319
trivial problem if you're both connected

1232
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,079
to tor you're gonna connect and that's

1233
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
why i really like tor so tor sort of

1234
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
gives you that perfect internet where

1235
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
two peers can always connect it kind of

1236
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,119
like reverts the internet's original sin

1237
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,119
um but there are a lot of problems that

1238
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,560
just being able to connect doesn't solve

1239
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,480
like what if someone's offline and how

1240
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
do you where does your message to them

1241
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
go when they're offline and do you have

1242
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,520
to wait until you're contemporaneously

1243
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,720
online to deliver that or is there

1244
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
someone who can hold it on hold on to it

1245
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
for you so peer-to-peer networks do need

1246
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,720
to solve those problems

1247
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,079
and i think

1248
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,839
those problems are tricky enough that

1249
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,319
big tech probably would have risen up

1250
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,079
in the state it's in even if we had been

1251
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,480
able to connect directly to each other's

1252
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
computers

1253
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
in my experience working with activist

1254
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,680
spaces everybody is really into the idea

1255
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,200
of privacy and they're like yeah

1256
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,800
encryption let's do it and then the

1257
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,480
amount of technical support that these

1258
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
you know non-tech savvy folks need is

1259
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,680
just wild

1260
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,560
what barriers to entry do you see or

1261
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,920
anticipate uh with quiet in particular

1262
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,280
well um

1263
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,960
i mean we're targeting ease of use

1264
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,280
that's at the level of signal or slack

1265
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,240
or discord um the one catch with the

1266
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,839
current system is around invitation

1267
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,720
there

1268
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
there can be situations where

1269
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
just if

1270
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,119
the owner isn't online that can be a

1271
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,960
little confusing but we can address

1272
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
stuff like that um

1273
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,240
and

1274
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,760
there is sometimes a user experience

1275
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,119
issue of like

1276
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,319
if no one's online and a message is sent

1277
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,160
you might get sort of new old messages

1278
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,520
like things you hadn't seen before that

1279
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,079
are syncing but that's a user experience

1280
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,400
problem and it doesn't come up that much

1281
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,760
um so i think the biggest thing is

1282
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,599
features like we don't have reactions we

1283
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,359
don't have like app mentions we don't

1284
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,880
have all the like granular notification

1285
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,319
controls these apps are really full

1286
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,000
featured and

1287
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,440
there's kind of one direction of getting

1288
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,599
the stack to be pretty reliable which

1289
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,880
we've made a lot of progress on but

1290
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,079
there's the other other direction of

1291
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,720
making it work as good as slack and

1292
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,560
discord do um

1293
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,240
and i think once you get there you're in

1294
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,560
the running you know i i was at fight

1295
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,079
for the future we use slack internally

1296
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,920
now they use matrix internally there was

1297
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,119
some grumbling when people adopted

1298
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,599
matrix but it went pretty well and i've

1299
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,040
tested quiet with the team there and

1300
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,079
like

1301
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,680
you know it doesn't do anything that

1302
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
they all the things they need yet is the

1303
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,839
problem

1304
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,720
but

1305
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,920
there isn't like an intrinsic problem

1306
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,359
and i think actually peer-to-peer apps

1307
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,800
can be more accessible than federated

1308
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,920
ones because you don't need someone to

1309
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,440
run the server and you don't have to

1310
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,680
think about like oh i'm homes at like my

1311
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
home server or there's things about the

1312
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,599
onboarding experience with them with

1313
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,880
federated systems that are just a little

1314
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,480
bit not what people expect

1315
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,920
with peer-to-peer apps or this one

1316
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,760
anyway it's just pick a username or

1317
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,119
enter the link pick a username and

1318
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,119
you're in and that's it

1319
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,160
awesome thank you yeah

1320
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
so i had a question about

1321
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,400
uh

1322
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,839
if there's a user

1323
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,680
that is

1324
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,920
uh offline or has very limited or

1325
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,960
offline a lot or has limited

1326
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,240
connectivity

1327
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
how effective is

1328
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
this that message queuing like say

1329
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,319
there's a user that's like oh i know i'm

1330
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,839
going to be offline but i want to be

1331
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,440
able to back read when i can get

1332
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,800
internet again

1333
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
is there a mechanism that would allow

1334
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
them to do that or do they just have to

1335
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,760
get back online before those messages

1336
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,319
get dropped by their peers

1337
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,000
um

1338
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,760
let me understand the question i'll just

1339
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,280
maybe say something to help understand

1340
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,960
it better nothing ever gets dropped

1341
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,839
well

1342
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,920
time deletion would would drop things

1343
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,319
eventually

1344
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,319
doing time deletion at like a five

1345
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,319
minutes or one hour scale would not work

1346
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,760
so great in the system because you would

1347
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,920
lose things but doing time deletion at

1348
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,839
like a two weeks or

1349
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,640
month scale would work fine presuming

1350
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,359
you have connectivity in that period

1351
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
um

1352
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,160
i think

1353
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,760
yeah if

1354
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,440
if you had very short time deletion

1355
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,079
scales then offlineness would lead to

1356
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,599
you missing messages but i think that's

1357
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,640
the user's intent in that case okay i i

1358
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,240
was just wondering if is is there a

1359
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,440
default offline time or default time

1360
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,240
deletion span in the system or like what

1361
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,400
what is it currently working with um we

1362
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,839
haven't implemented it yet it's planned

1363
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,760
but not implemented and

1364
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,880
i think the you know

1365
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,559
like if

1366
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,760
a good floor would be something like

1367
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,960
three months or six months and then

1368
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,880
users could ratchet it up from there

1369
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,319
okay thank you yeah

1370
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,079
one quick one question from online from

1371
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,440
user lego ktm you did call out github as

1372
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,160
a problematic proprietary server why is

1373
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,400
the quiet code developed there

1374
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,760
that's a good question um i think

1375
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,480
the issue isn't so much it's like

1376
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,800
it's that thing i said about

1377
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,720
is free software an

1378
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,960
ethical choice like being vegan or is it

1379
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
a

1380
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,440
movement to try to build power

1381
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,839
and i think

1382
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,359
um i think if it's a movement to try to

1383
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,720
build power you can think about it a

1384
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,720
little bit differently than okay we have

1385
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,680
to boycott everything

1386
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,520
i think at some point

1387
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,200
we'll want to run our own infrastructure

1388
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
so that we can be sure

1389
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
that our users are getting updates from

1390
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,280
us and not from

1391
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,960
you know the us government subverting

1392
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,640
microsoft to send an update through

1393
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
github to our users so there will be a

1394
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,880
real practical security reason

1395
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,760
for

1396
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
using it at some point and at that point

1397
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,200
we'll embrace running our own

1398
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,880
our own infrastructure the way tor

1399
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,319
project and others have

1400
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,160
but at this stage

1401
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
we got a huge mountain to climb just

1402
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,520
getting this stuff working and so i'm

1403
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,920
choosing my battles

1404
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,480
as you've described quiet

1405
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,440
there's just one major like master that

1406
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
allows for invite right

1407
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
one major what master for allowing

1408
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,319
invite like if the if the uh boss node

1409
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,880
is offline then invite doesn't work

1410
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,640
that's currently correct although we can

1411
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,359
use

1412
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,599
a tool in the tor ecosystem called onion

1413
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,559
balance

1414
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,520
to

1415
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,760
share that responsibility partially

1416
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,280
across

1417
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,680
either everybody in the community or

1418
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,720
some set of moderators and admins okay

1419
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,319
right now it's just one

1420
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,240
okay but the plan is to move to a like

1421
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,160
multi-master system so that you don't

1422
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,079
have to have the person who started the

1423
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,839
group online always

1424
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,480
yes and the one caveat is that if you

1425
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,160
want to do unique usernames you

1426
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,720
a good starting point is to still rely

1427
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,359
on the owner to be the sole giver of

1428
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,960
unique usernames

1429
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,040
you could have a consensus algorithm but

1430
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,400
that gets

1431
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
it gets dicey so

1432
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,160
probably what we would do

1433
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,400
in adding onion balance so that anyone

1434
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,559
can join even when the owner is offline

1435
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,119
is let people join as a guest first and

1436
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,280
then they would be sort of in this crdt

1437
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,800
as a guest and then when the owner came

1438
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,000
through the owner could see their

1439
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,760
certificate signing request

1440
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
sign it send that to the crt even if

1441
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,599
they weren't both offline online at the

1442
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,760
same time they could be sort of blessed

1443
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,319
as a full user and have a real username

1444
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,839
something like a next serve in an rc or

1445
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,200
something

1446
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,960
sounds good yeah my experience with

1447
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
slack matrix etc is that rarely is the

1448
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,680
person who started the group online

1449
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,240
when everyone else is so that

1450
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,400
restriction seems like it is a major

1451
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
usability issue it is it's super

1452
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,319
annoying and but yeah there is a path to

1453
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,680
resolving it but it introduces some

1454
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
complexity so we've deferred it another

1455
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,200
another path to solving is to try to

1456
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
keep phones online as much as you can

1457
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,680
run

1458
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,119
run um

1459
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,599
you know if the owner is

1460
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,640
running

1461
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,680
on

1462
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,760
on a desktop and on an android device

1463
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,280
and both are able to give out

1464
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,680
certificates

1465
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,480
it's

1466
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,200
you get decent coverage from that but

1467
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,119
yeah not not great

1468
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,079
thank you yeah

1469
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,119
thank you again for the talk

1470
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,880
uh ever just so everyone knows we do

1471
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,160
