1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
and then hopefully if this works then i

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,639
can do a demo after but if it doesn't

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,038
your

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm not sure if all the clips and stuff

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
will come across

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
all right

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
i'm just going to get started with some

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
basic background stuff first

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,719
all right so we're going to start before

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,239
this works

11
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
so my name is matt demaris i go by matt

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
the maker

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,000
i've been programming since 2004.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
teaching involved teaching myself and

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
volunteering since 07

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
and making things since 2012.

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,280
i've never been to hope i've never done

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
anything like this

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
but i truly

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,680
enjoy just keep doing something coding

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
and uh making things

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,520
um screwed up

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
you get it yes thank you

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
all right

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,799
so

26
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
um one of my more recent projects is a

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,759
wearable computer that is quite capable

28
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
and easily customized that i'll talk

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
about later

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
over the last few years i've modernized

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
my local food pantry but in order to

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
properly explain what i did i'm going to

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
have to provide some background info on

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
our food pantry and food pantries in

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
general

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
so generally food pantries are comprised

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
of older volunteers with manual

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
operations and minimal use of technology

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,920
and i'm going to show you that a little

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,720
technology can go a long way

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,200
so um i don't have any degrees

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
i tried to go to a four-year school

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
four-year school twice

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
and found out that i had a few screws

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
loose

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
so i ended up taking things at my own

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
pace taking filling in gaps in knowledge

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
at my community college

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
and then my

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
methods for teaching myself

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
as i follow and modify tutorials until

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
i'm comfortable with the hardware and

53
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
then once i know some hardware you can

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
mix them up make different combinations

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
and create new things

56
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,120
so where i volunteer

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
is a 100 volunteer organization

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,760
serving the residents of my town since

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,519
1983.

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,840
um not all food pantries are 100

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
volunteer and depending on where you get

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,370
your funding from

63
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,680
[Music]

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,879
you may have to pay staff members

65
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,400
so the mission of the sandwich food

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
pantry is to distribute food

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
and essential non-food items to families

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
who live work or attend religious

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,959
services in my community

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
and so we refer people to other services

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
available to them

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
and we never turn anyone away who comes

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
for help we'll give them an emergency

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
food order and refer non-clients to a

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
food pantry that serves their community

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
we're about 40 volunteers before covet

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
we were around 80 volunteers

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
so things have really

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
changed in that department mainly

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
because

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,239
the volunteer population is

82
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
generally older folks

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
and they're the most at risk

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
so there's always people struggling no

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
matter

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
how good or bad the economy may be due

87
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
to things like injuries or disabilities

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
temporary unemployment or senior

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,439
citizens fixed income

90
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,080
we rely on donations

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
from individuals as well as local

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,959
businesses

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,959
and we also apply for a few grants

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,159
so

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
how we get food

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
we had two orders a month from the

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
greater boston food bank

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
but prior to six months ago

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
we were getting 3 500 pounds

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
twice a month

101
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
now we're down to 1200 pounds twice a

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,918
month so we're at 35 percent

103
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
of what we were taking in and it's due

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
to a labor shortage it's not a food

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
shortage it's um

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
just labor

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,960
so

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
we have a weekly pickup of items from

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
the two local stop and shops we pick up

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
bread and

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
bakery items that we give out on

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
wednesdays

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
and there's also donation bins inside

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,960
the store

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,759
that we pick up at that time as well

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
we get donations from individuals

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
in town different groups

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,759
and if we

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,080
need to we buy things from either cisco

120
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,759
or we'll buy it from the store and we've

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
been having to

122
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
buy a lot of our food from less

123
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,960
economical sources

124
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,479
because we'd rather just get it from the

125
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
food bank

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,479
so

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,880
there's two main philosophies when it

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
comes to food pantries there's the

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
standardized food boxer bag model which

130
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
i'm going to refer to as pre-packed

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
and then there's the client choice model

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
the client choice model is the preferred

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,080
model because it offers higher

134
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
satisfaction with food clients are able

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
to choose

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
they tend not to take food they won't

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,240
use

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,759
and it's greater

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
opportunities for volunteer client

140
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,520
interaction

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,759
hybrid models also exist so partially

142
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,080
pre-packed and partially choices

143
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
and all these things are influenced by

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
your equipment your physical space the

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
number of volunteers and the number of

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
clients

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
but within client choice food pantries

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
there are different models

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
and you can mix and match these as well

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
so this is not a comprehensive list this

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
is just

152
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,400
a few

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,160
of the

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
popular ones

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
so there's the table model where you

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
need space to lay out tables lay out the

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,440
food

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
and clients will pack the food then

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
there's a supermarket model which

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
requires more space because you're using

161
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
carts and shelving and that type of

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
thing and in that model clients pack the

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,479
food

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,039
there's the window model where

165
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
all you need is a shelf

166
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
and an area where the client can view

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
the food and point to the items they

168
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,319
want and a volunteer will pack the food

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and finally there's the inventory list

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
model which works down from the smallest

171
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,039
place to large places

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,680
where you provide a basically a list of

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
check boxes

174
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
for people to choose what they want and

175
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,440
then

176
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
volunteers pack the food

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
so how we operated from

178
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
2007 to 2020 we used the inventory list

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
model and the table model

180
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
we were a very manual operation at that

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,039
time

182
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
we had two volunteers who would check

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,160
clients in

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
give them a number disc

185
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,639
and a color-coded order form

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
and then we had a waiting area of chairs

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
so they would check in they'd wait and

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
then they'd

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,039
see the assistant one at a time who

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
would go over additional choices

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
that for that week

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
and then once they finish their

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
inventory list

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
you would go to the packing room where

195
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,199
we had

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,240
one volunteer reading the list out loud

197
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
and the other volunteers packing the

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,039
items

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
and in the front area we have

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
bread and produce tables

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
with one volunteer at each table

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
and then at the once the clients are all

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,199
done they drive around the back of the

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
building and two volunteers load their

205
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
vehicle

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,639
um so i did all kinds of jobs i started

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
doing some pretty menial tasks like

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,840
writing dates on um items

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
putting things away grinding coffee

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
bringing orders out photocopying our

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,560
order forms

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
unloading food bank orders

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
restocking the packing room and packing

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,840
orders

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
so over time i was able

216
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,080
to

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
get the full picture of how the

218
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,800
organization operates and

219
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,520
so

220
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,960
our i.t infrastructure from 2007 to 2020

221
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
we had an access database

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
we always had two old desktops that were

223
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
always out of date

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,759
one laptop that was from

225
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,560
and

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
some outdated office equipment

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
and last but not least we had a dsl

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
internet

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,519
so in 2017

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,880
i made my first thing for the food

231
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
pantry

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
so i basically assisted the client

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,279
assistant

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,839
by displaying the choices

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
available for that week

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
on a

237
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
old monitor and then i upgraded to an

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
old tv

239
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
it allowed clients to get through the

240
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,279
process faster

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,399
and we would

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,120
update it weekly this is what so on the

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
left is the original one

244
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
and on the right is the

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
better looking

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
model we ended up using that for three

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,279
years

248
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,320
in

249
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
2018 i found out we would periodically

250
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,720
lose the contents of a freezer

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,760
due to human error or equipment failure

252
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
and i thought i could fix that so i

253
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
developed a freezer alarm and installed

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
initially installed four

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
it's very simple a couple door sensors a

256
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
thermocouple and an amplifier board

257
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
a buzzer and an rgb led

258
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
it cost approximately 75 each

259
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,000
they would upload the temperature to

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
adafruit io every minute

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
and if an alarm went off we would get a

262
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
we get a text with twilio so you get a

263
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
text you check the graph and then you

264
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,560
can kind of tell what's going on

265
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
here's some pictures from the first time

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
i the first alarm i installed

267
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
it's not pretty but it's pretty

268
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
effective

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,399
this is a double door model so you can

270
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
see i got the pie on top of the freezer

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
a couple leds

272
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,399
and

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
the other hardware

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
so what i had to do was

275
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
i didn't know what an alarm was i didn't

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
know what condition signified an issue

277
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
so i ended up unplugging two freezers

278
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
for eight hours

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
which

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
then led me to see that

281
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,680
a full freezer when it's dead is like a

282
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,640
log function it gets up to 20 after a

283
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
few hours but then it just kind of

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
levels off into the 20s

285
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
for

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
at least a couple days

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
but so my conditions for the

288
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
alarm are over 20 fahrenheit for over 30

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
minutes

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
will happen if someone opens the door

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
during a defrost or if someone

292
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
repeatedly has the door open for more

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
than a half hour

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
and the other condition it happens in is

295
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
when the freezer is dead

296
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
the the door alarms are pretty effective

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
five minutes

298
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
the alarm goes off but for the minute

299
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
prior to the alarm it starts beeping and

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
that usually catches people's attention

301
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
before the alarm goes off to address the

302
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
issue

303
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
but with the double door freezers

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
volunteers would constantly set them off

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
every time i got a food bank order

306
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,279
um

307
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
they laid all in front of the freezer

308
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
open the doors and set the alarm off

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,160
because stuff was in the way they

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
couldn't close the doors so i added

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,920
motion sensors to those

312
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,079
freezers and what that does is simply

313
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
restart the door timer

314
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
every time

315
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
motions it's activated by motion

316
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
i also had to create two fridge alarms

317
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
and it's a little bit more complex

318
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
because you need to be above and below a

319
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
certain temperature instead of just

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
below

321
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
so my alarm conditions i came up with is

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
33 or below for a minute

323
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,200
because you don't want anything to

324
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,839
freeze that's not

325
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,560
good um and then over 43 for 20 minutes

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
so according to the fda if you store

327
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
food in a refrigerator and it's 43

328
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
to 45 degrees and it's been two hours it

329
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,720
needs to be thrown away so that's why i

330
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
chose above 43 for 20 minutes

331
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
the defrost won't set it off but it's

332
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
still early enough

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
in the process to still intervene

334
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,639
and when we got one of these fridges we

335
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,760
plugged it in

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
it was behaving like a freezer it was it

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
was freezing everything

338
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
so i ended up using the temperature

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
sensor from the alarm to calibrate the

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
fridges

341
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,200
which worked pretty well

342
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,880
about a month after i installed the

343
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
first alarms i got a text message from

344
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,600
freezer five

345
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,560
freezer five that door is cursed so

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
every time you if you slam the door the

347
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
door bounces off the frame the lock pops

348
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
out and the door is locked open

349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,959
and

350
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,240
so um that that happens a couple times a

351
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
year

352
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
now

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
um

354
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
but we used every time it used to happen

355
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
we'd lose whatever

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
was in those freezers

357
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
um so

358
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
in 2019

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
i decided i was going to learn

360
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
salesforce

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
and

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
salesforce is available for non-profits

363
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
for

364
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
free up to 10 seats

365
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,079
but that doesn't come with any

366
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,519
development or anything you have to do

367
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
it all yourself

368
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,040
so in november 2019 i started

369
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
developing an uh salesforce system to do

370
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,959
our reporting to the food bank so if you

371
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,200
order from a food bank you have to

372
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
report certain information to them

373
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
just general totals of certain things

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,079
and so

375
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,880
so i started to do that in

376
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
salesforce so

377
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
i created a custom record object for our

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
clients and orders it took me a couple

379
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,639
weeks to clean up the data because it

380
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
was 30 years of

381
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,839
fat fingering

382
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,639
and

383
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,160
so i was able to import all of our

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
client data into the salesforce system

385
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,920
and recreate all everything we would do

386
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
i had it done in january 2020 so

387
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
we ran parallel to

388
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
the access system for the month of

389
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,839
february

390
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,720
now

391
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
what i mean by that is we would just

392
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
generate reports compare the reports

393
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,120
make sure they match up

394
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
so one thing i did

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
when i had access

396
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
to our client database was i geocoded

397
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,560
the data because i wanted to see where

398
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
our clients came from

399
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
i wasn't sure if there was going to be

400
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
any pattern or rhyme or reason to it

401
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
it turns out there isn't

402
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
because happens and everyone needs

403
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
help at some point

404
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
because we serve people who live work or

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
pray in our community

406
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,279
you can see that it greatly exceeds our

407
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,079
town boundary

408
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,480
so

409
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
here's where it got interesting

410
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,560
our original covid protocol and

411
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
salesforce deployment took place at the

412
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
same time

413
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,720
that's me up on the left there terrified

414
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
at a podium

415
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,680
and so what i did was i checked the

416
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
first client in on the laptop

417
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,120
and that was it i couldn't i couldn't

418
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
check anybody else in i couldn't do

419
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,040
anything except stand there and feel

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
useless

421
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
so

422
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,519
what i ended up doing we had two crews

423
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,279
of six volunteers

424
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
we would pre-pack all of the orders this

425
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
is when we started ordering produce from

426
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
cisco

427
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
and so my job was to check people in

428
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
which i ended up doing from my mobile

429
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,880
phone and to keep track of family size

430
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,360
i used colored coated post-its and just

431
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
slap them on the windshield once i check

432
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,759
people in to tell the other volunteers

433
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,399
what they need to do or how many choices

434
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
to offer

435
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
so then that freed me up so i could

436
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,720
check in six cars help make help them

437
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
all get out through the process

438
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,319
and record the bag totals

439
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
we operated drive-throughs for six

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
months but

441
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,199
it was really rough because

442
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
most of our volunteers are older

443
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
and we have and all the food was outside

444
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
in the summer heat

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,160
and same with the volunteers so

446
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,079
um

447
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
i uh i also noticed we went through way

448
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,800
more inventory

449
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,639
and i'll and the last thing i noticed

450
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
was that at least half of our clients

451
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,639
had smartphones which gave me an idea

452
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,079
so

453
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
we had one volunteer bring out the

454
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,920
non-perishable in the household items

455
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
that's the volunteer i would help the

456
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
most then we would pack dairy on demand

457
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
by family size

458
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,759
we had a table of bread and a table of

459
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,880
produce

460
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
with one volunteer offering choices

461
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,639
and then we had a meat cooler with one

462
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
volunteer offering choices

463
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and this is where i want to get into

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
like my public service announcement we

465
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
use google workspace for everything i've

466
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,279
made

467
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
accounts for every individual in our

468
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,279
organization as well as different roles

469
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,880
within our organization

470
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
it's really helpful you can make up to

471
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
two thousand users for free

472
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
and that's the foundation of our

473
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,799
uh it going

474
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
post covet

475
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,319
salesforce offers 10 users for free but

476
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,240
you have to develop it yourself

477
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
microsoft cloud 10 users for free but

478
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
the only reason we got microsoft cloud

479
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
was to get five free copies of offline

480
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
office because that's the only way to do

481
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
it now

482
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
we also use twilio for all our texting

483
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
and they will give you a 500 credit to

484
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
your account if you're doing it on

485
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
behalf of a non-profit

486
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,039
and then there's some other services we

487
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,919
get discounts on

488
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
so in june 2020

489
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
so a few months into the drive-through

490
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
situation i started developing an

491
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
ordering system it originally was going

492
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
to be just the numbering system

493
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
using text messages and a receipt

494
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,679
printer

495
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,120
but

496
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,600
every time i showed them what i was

497
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
working on they asked me to take it a

498
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
step further

499
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
so

500
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,280
i ended up building a now serving sign

501
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
and

502
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
everyone in our organization has a

503
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
mobile phone

504
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
so i put pushover on their phones which

505
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,679
allows them to see

506
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
numbers given out

507
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
numbers called as well as orders

508
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,919
submitted so when a client walks in our

509
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,720
volunteers can greet them by name

510
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
just by taking a quick glance at their

511
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
phone

512
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
so we use formstack to take the orders

513
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
and to receive orders we use zapier so

514
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
zapier

515
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
is

516
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,400
it takes the formstack order submission

517
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,919
and then we turn it into an html

518
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
formatted email

519
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,120
and that allows us to just use gmail on

520
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
the packing station to pick up orders

521
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,559
i'll show you what i mean by that

522
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
so this is the number machine it's not

523
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,480
very sophisticated

524
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
it's just

525
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
cost about 70 dollars in parts and about

526
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
12 to 15 dollars a year to uh

527
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,919
175 a year to run

528
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,480
so it works you put your hand on the top

529
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,280
and it will print out the um order form

530
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
i mean the the number

531
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,240
and then

532
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,200
i had to build a number sign so it's

533
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
like a now serving sign

534
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
i doubled up the led matrices because we

535
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
had some older clients

536
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
who complained that they couldn't see

537
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
the numbers from the car

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
so i 3d printed that little thing up in

539
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
the

540
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
top center just to hold the signs

541
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
together

542
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,760
um so in total the the signs cost 165

543
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
to build and then originally we weren't

544
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,960
going to have a packing station my plan

545
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,360
was to use volunteers phones

546
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,600
to handle that aspect of things

547
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
but in talking with the other people in

548
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,799
the organization they wanted something

549
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,080
like this so it added another 500 to the

550
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
cost of the system

551
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
so

552
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,400
the cost associated with running the

553
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,080
ordering system

554
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,120
between formstack and zapier 60 a month

555
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,720
or 7.25 a year

556
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,600
so in in total um

557
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
the ordering system cost about 750 bucks

558
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,200
if we didn't have the packing station it

559
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,159
would be 250 bucks

560
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,200
it's 75 a month to run which equals

561
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,640
about 900 a year so we save we save more

562
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
inventory a month than we spend on the

563
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
system

564
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,520
um

565
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,799
and i made it because we needed

566
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,679
something and i knew our process

567
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,720
so i was able to create something that

568
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
we could just

569
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
work with because it was based on our

570
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,000
underlying processes that we used to

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,919
have

572
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
after learning about all the things i

573
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
did for the food pantry the board of

574
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
directors decided to compensate me for

575
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
quite a bit of work over the last few

576
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,240
years

577
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
and it was it was pretty nice to be

578
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
paid for something that i had already

579
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
finished it's like i didn't have to do

580
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
anything else

581
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
so how we operate now you can see the

582
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
packing station

583
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
is down at the end there you can see the

584
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
alarms the blue lights on the alarms

585
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
so we've been using a digital inventory

586
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
list model

587
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,880
which i believe any inventoryless model

588
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
can be digitized

589
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,919
so

590
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,000
a lot of food pantries could

591
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,039
go digital rather quickly if they have

592
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
the underlying processes behind the

593
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,280
paper system

594
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,120
and we also switch to the supermarket

595
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
model

596
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
so

597
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,919
we have now we have

598
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,600
one volunteer

599
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
signing in clients on the other side of

600
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,679
the building the waiting room is outside

601
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
or in a vehicle if the weather sucks

602
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
the packing room is two volunteers

603
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that's where i am i operate the packing

604
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
station

605
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,159
um

606
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,520
and in the front room we have two

607
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,679
volunteers to just help

608
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,159
assist clients fill their carts and

609
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
get the proper number of choices for

610
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
their family size

611
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
and then when they're done we still have

612
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,799
the back door clients drive around back

613
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,760
below the order in their car

614
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
this is the original order form so you

615
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
can see it's pretty basic

616
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,320
you just have

617
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
name

618
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
order number phone number and a bunch of

619
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
check boxes

620
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
unfortunately

621
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,400
the number of meat choices we were

622
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,360
offering

623
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
was based on the family size and that

624
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
would not always be entered in correctly

625
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
so what ended up happening

626
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,640
is i'd have to track down someone who

627
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,559
put in more or less choices than they

628
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,840
were supposed to get and figure out what

629
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
they actually wanted so that was enough

630
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,120
of a problem

631
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,679
where we ended up getting a

632
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,480
new client freezer for the front room

633
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
so we ordered a three door freezer and

634
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
we had to wait five months to get it

635
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
three days after it was plugged in it

636
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
died

637
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,480
so it died so fast we hadn't even put

638
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
food in it yet and i hadn't put an alarm

639
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,159
on it

640
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
so once it was repaired i put the alarm

641
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,720
on it

642
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
i basically used the strip down model

643
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,159
like the fridge

644
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,760
because this freezer has auto closing

645
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
doors

646
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
and so we load it with

647
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,080
food and this is what the alarm looks

648
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,640
like the stripped down one

649
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
so then it died again so here's where

650
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
i'll show you my logic

651
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,760
so

652
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,280
i marked it failing at around 7 pm

653
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
the alarm triggered around nine and we

654
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,559
had to empty it we emptied it around 10

655
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
30 pm

656
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
as you can see after we emptied it it

657
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
continued to not work

658
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
so

659
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
this is what we came into

660
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
one of the ladies was very upset when

661
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,240
she came in and saw the freezer was

662
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,919
reading 41

663
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,840
but luckily i reassured her that sensor

664
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,000
was located in the top of the unit

665
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
and the sensor i have in there was still

666
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
reading in the mid-20s

667
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,559
so we felt a lot better after that

668
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,440
so we had to empty everything

669
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
so then it was you can see it was

670
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
fixed again

671
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,360
and then

672
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,919
three days later died again we had to

673
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,279
re-empty it wait for them to come in

674
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,400
fix it again

675
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
and you see those last two spikes on the

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,360
right that's the fourth motor blowing

677
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
so

678
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
what happened we had four oem motors had

679
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
died

680
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,440
just

681
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,279
didn't last more than a few days each

682
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,799
they chalked it up to supply chain

683
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,120
issues which they said they didn't have

684
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,279
but obviously they did

685
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
so if i didn't have an alarm on that

686
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,400
freezer we would have lost the most

687
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,120
amount of food we ever would have lost

688
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,240
at a time not once but twice and that

689
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
would have been some really bad pr for

690
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
that company

691
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,039
so i redid the order form

692
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
now that we didn't have meat choices on

693
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
the auto form i was able to offer some

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
static choices

695
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,799
um

696
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
to for certain items so you can pick

697
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,640
which type of veggies you get you can

698
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
pick which type of jelly you get you can

699
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
pick butter or margarine coffee and

700
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,039
baking mix

701
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
it's just nice to offer people choices

702
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
because they really appreciate it

703
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,799
so

704
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,080
here's something we could never do when

705
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,440
we were on paper

706
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
i can dump our ordering system

707
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,080
anytime i want so this is our last 250

708
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
orders

709
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,840
you can see the most popular

710
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,640
items are eggs and toilet paper

711
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
but then again only 85 percent of people

712
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
want those items

713
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
what i ended up noticing is

714
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
if we were still pre-packing orders this

715
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,320
would be a blue rectangle but it's not

716
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,279
people choose only what they need

717
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
so on face value we save 43 of our

718
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
inventory by letting people pick what

719
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,679
they want but when you take into account

720
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
family size

721
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,520
which influences the number of items

722
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
that are headed out the door

723
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,080
it's over a 50 savings on inventory

724
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,600
simply by letting people pick what they

725
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
want

726
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
we had some more freezer

727
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,520
problems i i really like the freezer

728
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,799
alarms because most of the time i don't

729
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,480
hear from them and every time i hear

730
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
from them

731
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
i get credited for saving the day

732
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
so

733
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
we had an alarm go off so i noticed the

734
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
freezer stopped working for about eight

735
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,799
hours

736
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,559
so we emptied it we called the

737
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
refrigeration company

738
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
they they came in it was working when

739
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
they were there

740
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
so they said nothing was wrong

741
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
so

742
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,559
about seven days later it stopped

743
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,039
for 24 hours but again by the time the

744
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
refrigeration company got there it was

745
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
working again

746
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
so nothing was wrong

747
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
about a week later we had a catastrophic

748
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
catastrophic

749
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
and all the boards and sensors in the

750
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
unit were replaced

751
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,000
and since then that unit's been okay

752
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,679
a couple weeks ago we had our client

753
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,200
freezer you know the one that died four

754
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
times

755
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
we had it freeze over a little bit

756
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,919
and i was able to uh notice

757
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
basically i was able to notice these

758
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
patterns and we were able to uh

759
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
figure out that inside the unit had just

760
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,760
due to humidity

761
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,679
had built up enough ice to impact the

762
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,120
performance of the unit

763
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,640
so we just took a heat gun

764
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,200
and melted it and then it was back to

765
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
business

766
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,919
so

767
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,159
our i.t infrastructure

768
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,760
from 2020 till now we use salesforce

769
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,159
two desktops that i picked out last year

770
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,720
one laptop i picked out in 2020

771
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
we use workspace for email and documents

772
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,600
we got some nice printers the color

773
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,120
laserjet

774
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,399
we have raspberry pi's protecting our

775
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,159
food as well as the ordering system

776
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,679
helping us

777
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
save inventory

778
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
and we finally upgraded to comcast

779
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,039
internet because i threw a hissy fit um

780
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,399
when we were still on dsl

781
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,240
so

782
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,760
that's that's pretty much everything

783
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,799
i've done

784
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,520
at the food pantry in the last few years

785
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
it is um

786
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,720
it is a lot of fun

787
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,039
to work with these people

788
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,279
now they may not be technical people

789
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
they can use the systems you set up for

790
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
them but they cannot set up anything for

791
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
themselves so these organizations need

792
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,640
people like us to

793
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
set up services for them to help them

794
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
operate better

795
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
so in

796
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,399
2017

797
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,600
i built

798
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
the

799
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,559
um

800
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,320
first prototype

801
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,480
of a wearable computer using a raspberry

802
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,520
pi

803
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
i will

804
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
this is from the day the day i actually

805
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,039
created it i went on show and tell and

806
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,559
showed it off a little bit so

807
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,559
but this is what it looks like so far oh

808
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,840
cool

809
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,080
so what i've done with the code

810
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
is i've lined up the zoom on the camera

811
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
so it lines up with your field of vision

812
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,480
so it's kind of like augmented reality

813
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
and i'll be adding the user interface on

814
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
top of that

815
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,799
there's already more users of your thing

816
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,320
than google glass congratulations

817
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
so that was the first version so i used

818
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
the pi zero and a wi-fi hat

819
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,279
and a camera

820
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,600
eventually i i kept working on this

821
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
project weekly i went back on

822
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
show-and-tell quite a few times and i

823
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
ended up building or making a guide for

824
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
version one of pie glass

825
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
in 2017

826
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
so this is version one you can see it's

827
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,159
really bulky and

828
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,559
pretty janky but

829
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
it works pretty well

830
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,320
unfortunately

831
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480
after a while

832
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,679
i couldn't

833
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,320
take the project any further

834
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
um

835
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
it cost about 300 to make an an hour and

836
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
20 minutes to assemble most of that was

837
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,919
doing the soldering because i struggle

838
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
with that sometimes

839
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,799
so it's made of some basic parts there's

840
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,600
safety glasses a pizzeria w

841
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,279
a viewfinder display

842
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,200
you have the raspberry pi spy cam on

843
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
there i used an audio hat with a bone

844
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
conduction transducer mounted to the

845
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
frame

846
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
everything is held together with zip

847
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,399
ties and heat shrink

848
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
and then in

849
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,880
2021

850
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,200
when the pi zero two came out i decided

851
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,520
to revisit the concept

852
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
so i rebuilt it

853
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,320
with safety glasses but this time i used

854
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
instead of putting the pie on the side

855
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
of my head i put the pie on the back of

856
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
my head with a baseball cap

857
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
it makes it look a lot more streamlined

858
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
and it's easier to assemble

859
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
so i use the pi zero two the same

860
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,399
display the same camera

861
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,720
i use the better audio board that

862
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
actually has two microphones on it so it

863
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
functions like a speakerphone so when

864
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
you're live streaming or recording a

865
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,200
video you actually have audio

866
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
and then the bone conduction transducer

867
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,840
is mounted to

868
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,639
the frame

869
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,279
with uh heat shrink

870
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,399
and then

871
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,840
um instead of

872
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
the the version one was controlled with

873
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
ssh from a phone and it was kind of

874
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,440
cumbersome and stuff so i ended up using

875
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
a bluetooth gamepad

876
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,399
to

877
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,039
create my interface

878
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
and this model is also held together

879
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,960
with zip ties and heat shrink

880
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,480
here's some pictures of version two

881
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,519
so i got the assembled thing on the left

882
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,200
and me wearing it on the right

883
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,919
now

884
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,519
instead of ssh on a phone i created

885
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,080
a user interface so

886
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,760
the

887
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,200
so the way the user interface is

888
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,080
triggered is there's a button

889
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
on the audio hat on the back of your

890
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
head

891
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
and that will either start the

892
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,000
application launcher

893
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
or it will kill any program that could

894
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,399
be running so you typically launch your

895
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,440
program

896
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
do your thing push the button when

897
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,799
you're done

898
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,360
and the everything is controlled with

899
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,399
this

900
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,679
8-bit do's tiny little 0-2 game pad

901
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,120
it's used to

902
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,799
well the main thing is the application

903
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,000
launcher

904
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,279
which i will

905
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,600
show you how that works

906
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
so when i was working on the project

907
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,000
initially everything was hard coded

908
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,559
i had to edit two files

909
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,640
add about 20 lines to add an option to

910
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,440
the

911
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,760
application launcher

912
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,720
so i created a markup file

913
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
to handle that for me

914
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
so you give it a name a color for

915
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,679
rainbow mode because i have rainbow mode

916
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,760
and um

917
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,679
the command you want to run or the shell

918
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,799
script

919
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,000
that you

920
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
want to run

921
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
and then you put the associated

922
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
processes with those commands

923
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
on the last line

924
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,919
so you can

925
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,320
successfully launch applications

926
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,240
and and terminate them when you want to

927
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,519
there are

928
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,559
five main pieces of

929
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
pie glass version two

930
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,200
so ffm pegs for live streaming you can

931
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
live stream to any rtmp service

932
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,760
i have cody for watching movies netflix

933
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,159
youtube that type of thing

934
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,559
i use opencv for

935
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,880
camera related functions

936
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,000
mostly all the applications i wrote for

937
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,720
this version are in python

938
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,200
and last but not least i have retropie

939
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,599
so we can uh

940
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,800
play

941
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
snes nes games and stuff

942
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,399
and um

943
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,359
so

944
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,239
in march

945
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,960
march of this year

946
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,639
i made it into

947
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,320
raspberry pi magazine which was pretty

948
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,879
cool they're really nice people

949
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,918
and

950
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,320
they definitely appreciated me sharing

951
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,159
this project with them one of the

952
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,040
coolest things that they said

953
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
was

954
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,040
that they look forward to the cyberpunk

955
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,599
cyberglass future

956
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
so that gave me an idea i had been

957
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,599
working on a guide for my website

958
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,639
which

959
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,520
it

960
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,280
wasn't that great

961
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,918
i ended up contacting the folks at

962
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
adafruit to see if they if i could write

963
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
a guide for version two

964
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,320
because i wrote one for version one so

965
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
they said yes and then i was terrified

966
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
because it wasn't done

967
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,200
i still had quite a bit of work to do

968
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,640
my

969
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,760
application launcher was still

970
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
hard-coded at the time

971
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,119
so this is the point where

972
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,599
i created the markup file to make it

973
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,040
easy

974
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,839
one thing i would love to show you

975
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,320
is exactly how easy it is

976
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,280
to

977
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
make this version

978
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,359
you take four pieces of heat shrink for

979
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,520
the bone conduction transducer and you

980
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,880
mount it to the glasses frame

981
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
and then

982
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,400
you attach it to the audio board mount

983
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,599
the camera

984
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,680
mount the mount for

985
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,200
the display

986
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
it's two zip ties to mount the pie to

987
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,160
the hat

988
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,040
then you just have to run a camera cable

989
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
down the side of it

990
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,520
to the front

991
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,759
and

992
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,160
that's all it takes so the entire

993
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
process to create one of these glasses

994
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,000
is about 20 minutes

995
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,720
which is um

996
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
surprisingly

997
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
you'd be it's done before you even get

998
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,839
started almost

999
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
um of the the main things i wanted to

1000
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,720
show you is

1001
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
i used opencv

1002
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,000
for

1003
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
to create my own filter program so it

1004
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,320
does facial recognition and you can

1005
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
overlay

1006
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,599
whichever image you want on different

1007
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
locations on people's faces so you can

1008
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,960
see i got

1009
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,800
a brain blender and a dumb sticker

1010
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,440
oh it's not up there

1011
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,440
okay

1012
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,000
um

1013
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,440
well

1014
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
unfortunately i guess i can't show you

1015
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
that stuff but if

1016
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
if i can if i can get the demo to work

1017
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
i'll do a quick little

1018
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,598
demo for you guys

1019
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,079
and matt while you do that can we take

1020
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,000
some questions or would you prefer not

1021
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,880
to multitask

1022
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,440
we have one question in the chat

1023
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
okay are there any tutorials on youtube

1024
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,400
for the fridge alarm system you made

1025
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,640
there's no tutorials on youtube but i it

1026
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
is on github

1027
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,040
nice

1028
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,440
i can provide the link to that after

1029
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,680
if necessary

1030
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,119
um

1031
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,520
any other questions

1032
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,560
i'm interested

1033
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,680
see that's the interesting question when

1034
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,240
i started out on this path i was looking

1035
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,760
for open source solutions to this

1036
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,880
problem and i couldn't find any so i

1037
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,079
didn't want to try to build something

1038
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,760
out all myself so i just went through

1039
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,520
the path of least resistance in terms of

1040
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,760
free services but there should be open

1041
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,560
source

1042
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
solutions to these problems that

1043
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,399
i guess are going to have to be created

1044
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,440
have you thought of prioritizing any of

1045
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,839
these things like making it into a box

1046
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,960
or a kit that somebody

1047
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,680
um that would

1048
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
that i haven't thought of that but

1049
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,599
that's that's a good idea that would be

1050
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,720
cool like send out a iot freezer kit to

1051
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
somebody and

1052
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,960
they set it up and get it going

1053
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,040
to engage with the freezer companies and

1054
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,200
get them to put it in there

1055
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
yeah one thing i noticed is

1056
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,359
there's a lot of stuff like

1057
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,160
we have a wide variety of equipment

1058
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,640
some is analog some digital we don't

1059
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
have problems with the analog equipment

1060
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,760
we have problems with the digital

1061
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,880
equipment

1062
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,200
you know like and

1063
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
it's just a little

1064
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,320
frustrating at times knowing that

1065
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,160
the old technology works fine and then

1066
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,079
they throw a computer in it and now it

1067
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,160
sucks

1068
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,160
yep

1069
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
yeah we have three volunteers that are

1070
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,359
on the tax list

1071
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,720
and whenever it goes off they

1072
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,640
immediately text me

1073
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,400
because i'm the one who can interpret

1074
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,000
the graphs they can look at the graph

1075
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
but they don't know what's going on when

1076
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
i look at it i know it's either dead

1077
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,440
someone had it open too long or

1078
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,560
something else happens but um

1079
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,799
yeah

1080
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,480
it sounds like you need rumbles

1081
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,160
like

1082
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,319
if the graph looks like this

1083
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,240
yeah yeah i should definitely like do

1084
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
some documentation like this is the

1085
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
dead one this one's okay

1086
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,359
yeah

1087
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,680
what are you using to make your grass

1088
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,480
i'm just using uh adafruit io which is

1089
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
free

1090
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,359
it's basically an mqtt

1091
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,040
service

1092
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
and

1093
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
you just they have dashboards that you

1094
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
can just drag a line chart into and

1095
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,520
it works it sounds like we got a

1096
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,680
hacker's got talent presentation coming

1097
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,920
up from matt tonight

1098
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,760
i think right give him a round of

1099
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
applause if you'd like to see some of

1100
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,990
that

1101
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,400
[Applause]

1102
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,880
these are great questions we have about

1103
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
five more minutes for questions if

1104
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
anybody want to

1105
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
keep interacting

1106
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,520
this is outputting something right now

1107
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
i'm asking

1108
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,560
i don't think it's working so

1109
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
if i may i know you know during my day

1110
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,280
job i do

1111
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,760
avp of quality and data for a non-profit

1112
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,599
and it's a health organization one of

1113
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,200
our departments is a food pantry and i'm

1114
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
already texting and sending pictures

1115
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,760
because pantry is a big deal and during

1116
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,160
covet you know there was a just so many

1117
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,760
more people that needed food and

1118
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,200
managing that and you couldn't give it

1119
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,359
in person so like what you're doing is

1120
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,760
amazing and you alluded to this someone

1121
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,920
in the audience already alluded you know

1122
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,599
people like you with your talents and

1123
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,119
your brains

1124
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,640
can benefit so many underground

1125
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,680
people that are doing these services

1126
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,440
for the population that don't have the

1127
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,359
skills we're struggling with figuring

1128
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,680
out systems and qr codes and they're

1129
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,119
these tech companies that are selling

1130
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,960
this to for hundreds of thousands of

1131
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,079
dollars

1132
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,359
thousands just

1133
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,240
you know

1134
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,560
gauging the prices for something that

1135
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,760
can be done for so much less um so

1136
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,440
if you want to use your talents for

1137
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
something good and make a couple of

1138
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,640
bucks you know i don't know about

1139
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,800
hundreds of thousands of dollars but you

1140
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,599
know

1141
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,440
definitely reach out and matt i'm gonna

1142
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,000
speak to you later

1143
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
middle school students

1144
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,000
we use the cpx

1145
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,880
it has all of these capabilities but may

1146
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,560
i use your information that you're

1147
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,319
providing here as a real-time example

1148
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,839
and even try to get in touch with you

1149
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,520
for some of the code maybe not sure it's

1150
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,599
a perfect example of a real world

1151
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,520
application of this for the students

1152
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,920
versus just doing the fun stuff

1153
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,839
to get them

1154
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,400
introduced yeah this is kind of awesome

1155
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,839
yeah it's

1156
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,359
it's a lot of fun because it's very

1157
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,440
satisfying when you can create something

1158
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,839
that actually has a benefit yeah versus

1159
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,720
just some experiment or something like

1160
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,839
that and we do all of

1161
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,160
these but you literally put them

1162
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,480
together in a perfect example that's

1163
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,079
actually solving problems saving money

1164
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,160
with your

1165
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
the food pantry

1166
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,359
some of the problems that we have with

1167
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,200
the food pantry are like we don't know

1168
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,520
what food we're gonna be getting right

1169
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,359
you know so like when you guys were

1170
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,640
having the

1171
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,280
the uh people come and choose like what

1172
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,800
foods like did you guys already have

1173
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,040
that information before are you are you

1174
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,440
um communicating with your providers

1175
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,440
um

1176
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,040
so

1177
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,400
uh we offer

1178
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,560
choices on our non-perishable items so

1179
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
that's what we people are ordering and

1180
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,160
we're prepa we're packing for them at

1181
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,359
the time

1182
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,560
the other

1183
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,000
like the produce

1184
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,880
the bread all that stuff is on

1185
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,960
is in like a shopping area

1186
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,280
so we're only

1187
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
they're only ordering the non-perishable

1188
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,079
items which could be on the shelf for a

1189
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,440
very long time

1190
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,800
and

1191
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,440
instead of because when we were doing

1192
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
the drive-throughs and giving everyone

1193
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
everything we went through inventory at

1194
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,760
like 3 or 4x of what we used to

1195
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,720
and providing choices on those items was

1196
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,960
the created the biggest improvement

1197
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,280
so if you have any static

1198
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,680
choices on your

1199
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,520
menu you could offer

1200
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,839
those as like a inventory list

1201
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,800
all right so let's see how much time

1202
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,200
we're at we have one minute all right

1203
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,319
i'm gonna

1204
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,839
who wants who doesn't want to be on

1205
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,680
twitter

1206
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,720
what who doesn't want to be on twitter

1207
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,760
get kicked off twitter no no no no

1208
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,359
like who doesn't want their picture on

1209
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,000
twitter okay

1210
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,280
yeah we're all masking anyway all right

1211
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,839
see those words

1212
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,920
so then

1213
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
you go to the keyboard

1214
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
and you type in

1215
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,480
what you want your tweet to be

1216
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
so

1217
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,599
and

1218
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,960
that's it

1219
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
so

1220
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,920
um

1221
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,800
as soon as yup it was posted

1222
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,680
so i use the um

1223
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,280
i forget which api it is but it's a

1224
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,640
python

1225
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,880
api for twitter

1226
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,240
i think it's

1227
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,118
it should be works

1228
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
the maker but there's an underscore in

1229
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,280
front of that

1230
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,480

1233
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,640
