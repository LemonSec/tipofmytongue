50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
so this is a it's a little bit of

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
rambling talk but it's based on the same

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
idea on a talk that i did a bunch of

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,440
years ago so back in 2014 it was hopex

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
i did this thing called the

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
self-publishing uh sorry self-publishing

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,879
success story talking about how i moved

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
the book from a publisher onto

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
self-publishing it myself through a

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
thing called createspace had a pretty

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
good run

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,879
and then in 2020 i tried to make very

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,720
small update to the book um which is a

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,879
475 page book oh i have here's the new

64
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,239
one i'm going to give this away at the

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,239
end so that's the new small one this is

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,200
not the 500 page one um so i tried to

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
change the words master and slave in

68
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,879
there and this is not related to those

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
words but the book ended up getting

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
trapped in amazon purgatory where it

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,159
actually still resides because i

72
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,000
couldn't get it out and i'm going to

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,360
talk about how that all that happened

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
and then i'm going to talk a little bit

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
also about what it's like to

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
self-publish now what i'm doing now and

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
some of the economics of that as well

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
so whom i am a professor of

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
entertainment technology at city tech in

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
brooklyn as part of cuny my local on

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
stagehand i've written basically i've

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,519
written the same book like six different

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
times so at first there was control

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
systems for live entertainment then it

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
became shown up versus control systems

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
now it's introduction to show networking

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
subject matter expert on the esta etcp

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
and i've done a little bit everything

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
mostly in live entertainment and mostly

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,360
in sound and networking but i've worked

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
on feature films and concerts and theme

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,720
parks and uh all kinds of stuff

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
also a storm chaser and photographer

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,519
i actually talked about that here before

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,400
and i've

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
uh i guess i've spoken to every hope

97
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
since 2010 including the virtual one so

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,680
again it's really nice to be back in

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
person with everybody

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
um so i mentioned this already but the

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
first book was way back in 1994

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
um then i made a second edition of the

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
third edition so those were all just

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
traditional this i should mention is a

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,279
trade book um so it's a technical book

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
about show networking and one those days

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
it was more about control systems um

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,080
with a fairly narrow market in the live

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
entertainment production area and that

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
back then you you know i get you could

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
self-publish but it wasn't that as easy

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
to do it as is now and so i did this

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
with a publisher i did three editions

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
with them

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
and then i actually got a sabbatical to

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
make an updated version and then the

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
publisher is like well we don't know the

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,120
third edition the sales or whatever and

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
of course in reality they did like

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,639
virtually nothing to sell it

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,600
um

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
so then uh i was like i always say i was

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
depressed for like a day and then i said

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
hey maybe i can self-publish it so

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,680
in 2012 i got the the book

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
self-published and actually

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
coincidentally like i literally got the

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
copy right before hope nine um made a

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
kindle edition

130
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,440
and then in 2014 i presented this uh

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
this story self-publishing success story

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,039
that's still online it's on my website

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
you can go see it uh talks about about

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,639
all that but just i'll touch on some

135
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,880
points about it but the basic idea was

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
you know i got off the publisher and

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
then i moved to this thing called

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
createspace so createspace was

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
originally

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,639
independent and then they got bought by

141
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,160
amazon but i it ran really well copies

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
just a brief this is all explained in

143
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
the other talk but a brief uh sort of

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
overview of that as when you do print on

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
demand there's literally like a giant

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
laser printer and a robot that makes a

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
cover so when you order a copy it's just

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
printed out the machine spits it out and

149
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
it

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
excuse me and amazon has several these

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
printing things these days just tied in

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
with their warehouses so if you i think

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
the it used to be the closest one to

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
here was in uh newark delaware so if you

155
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,759
order a copy they would just print it

156
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
and they'd ship it right up

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
back then i had sold about 1700 copies

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,880
and again self-publishing you do most of

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
the work but you keep all the money so

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
with the publisher they keep 90 of the

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
wholesale costs so that means that's

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
usually about 40 off the list price so

163
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,440
if you have a 10 book that means that uh

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
they will sell it for six and you get 10

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
of that right so nothing really

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
um and in the old days they had a lot of

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
costs right they had to print things

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,039
warehouses do all that kind of stuff

169
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
they don't do that anymore anymore

170
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,440
again that's on my website so in uh 2017

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
i made a second edition of the

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
self-published book

173
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,360
excuse me and then so that was already

174
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
out and then 2018 i get this email from

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
uh

176
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
amazon from createspace and it'd be hard

177
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
to read up there but

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
excuse me um

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
basically they're like we're moving

180
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
create space which had always been run

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
separately into this thing they called

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
kindle direct or the desktop desktop

183
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,199
it's kindle direct publishing so

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
basically merging it all together

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
and at the time i didn't pay much

186
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,039
attention to this and i couldn't do much

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
anyway because i just updated the new

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
version all that everything seemed fine

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
and it's the usual corporate language

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
you know distribution blah blah blah for

191
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,199
me nothing really changed it kept

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,840
selling everything seemed fine

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
then as i mentioned in 2020 i attempted

194
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,720
to update the book

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
and then why was i updating it a couple

196
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
reasons one the market had changed so

197
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,840
rather than this big book like the small

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
book is uh is covers most uh

199
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
applications

200
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
um

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
that was the main reason and i thought

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
well this won't be too hard and i it's

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
2020 right i had time sitting at home my

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
god won't be too hard i'll extract these

205
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
chapters out of the main book update

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
them print the new one uh do that

207
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,639
and then also of course around that time

208
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,520
was

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
all the black live matters protests and

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
everything and then sort of just the

211
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
awareness in the industry that this

212
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
terminology a master and slave which

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,960
they talked about in a control systems

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
context uh that it was obsolete and

215
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
needed to go and that was happening it's

216
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
pretty obvious but it's happening in the

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
industry so really the only update that

218
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
i wanted to make on the book was just

219
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,360
edit like two paragraphs in there get

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
rid of this archaic language and then

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
create a new version and that's sort of

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,440
the idea of the self-publishing thing

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,360
anyway since it's all print on demand

224
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
you should be able to make a new version

225
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
every day just the next one gets ordered

226
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
uh we'll um you know we'll have the new

227
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
update on it

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
um so i thought i would do go through

229
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
the big book um to sort of refresh

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
myself that had been a few years sort of

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
refresh myself on how it was extract

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
this out make this little change updated

233
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
and then i make the new one i thought

234
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
everything this would be great so

235
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
um so i should talk a little bit about

236
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,959
framemaker

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
so frame maker uh i can't see has

238
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,720
anybody heard of frame maker before i'm

239
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
always curious oh one hand oh two hands

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
when i'm okay good um

241
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
so back in the 2000s i started doing the

242
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
production work on the book after a

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
couple additions with the publisher and

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
they have really great people that do

245
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
you know graphics and layout and all

246
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
that stuff but they don't understand the

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
material so it's not really their job so

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
i wanted you know if i have this chart

249
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
or this diagram i want it attached to

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
this paragraph no matter what i don't

251
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,279
want it to flow to the next page or

252
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
anything like that so framemaker could

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
do that that's what i did the original

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
book in and it's still being used today

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
so the ieee standards for like ethernet

256
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,760
which is like a 800 or thousand page

257
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
document they still write as a i just

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
checked on the web last week they still

259
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
write in frame maker so it's still

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,680
around every few years like oh framework

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,800
is going to die

262
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
it's it's not and it's really great if

263
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
you have you need to write a user's

264
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
manual in 12 languages or have some very

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
complicated uh sort of linked documents

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,959
and things like that and multiple

267
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
platforms it's really really powerful

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
it's really overkill for a simple print

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,360
book with an e-book version

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
but i was kind of was already in it and

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
i tried in the previous editions i

272
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
really want to get off of it but it was

273
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
just it's too you're kind of stuck in

274
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
this thing it's an immense amount of

275
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
work to export out of it and go into

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
indesign or something which is much more

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,640
popular today

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,839
um so fun begins with

279
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,240
us i got the new version of framemaker

280
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
in 2020 i changed the 20 words in the

281
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
book and then

282
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
like literally the way i did the edits

283
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
pages didn't reflow i mean pre-maker can

284
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,399
update all this in an instant it's not

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
that difficult but literally the number

286
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
of pages stayed the same the cross

287
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
references stayed the same every nothing

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,760
changed didn't touch one graphic or

289
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
anything in the book just exactly the

290
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,519
same and then i had like a google

291
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
document because the export process is a

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
little bit you know there's some trial

293
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
and error that had a google document

294
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
followed that down went through the

295
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
whole thing so step by step so i knew

296
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
what i was doing export it out um and

297
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
then i made a

298
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
excuse me coffee so much um

299
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,760
i made what's called a kindle print

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
replica which is a way that you can take

301
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
a pdf and stick it in a kindle and then

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
it stays inside the kindle world but

303
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
it's it keeps your graphic layout so

304
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,279
that way i don't have to redo the whole

305
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,000
thing

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
and i'll talk about my ebook sales are

307
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
still much smaller than the print ones

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
that worked great but then the pdf for

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
the interior the print book i got this

310
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
error

311
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,959
there's something going on i can't hear

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
the oh sorry

313
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
um error processing interior i theory i

314
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
should probably could have titled the

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
talk this because that's really what my

316
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
entire life became for a couple weeks of

317
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
this sort of nightmare

318
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
all it says so this is a like

319
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,320
475 page uh pdf i get this whenever it

320
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,079
just says error there's a problem

321
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,640
processing your interior check your file

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
and try again so

323
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
useless right there's no information in

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
there at all

325
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,880
createspace tech support was excellent

326
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,399
they were down in that south carolina i

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
think you would call email get the

328
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
information they could fix things it was

329
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
great however when i contacted

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,560
the

331
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,360
kdp tech support which i believe during

332
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
this part as part of their integration

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
i'm speculating somebody may know but i

334
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
think they offshored it somewhere

335
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,800
email was useless i had the call of

336
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
course they told me to clear my cookies

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
which is always aggravating

338
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
then they told me that like oh you

339
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,600
should print the kindle uh print replica

340
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
file it's like it's called a replica

341
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
it's not the pdf which is like a high

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
quality thing for printing uh they

343
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
wanted me to so it's basically sort of

344
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
like taking a jpeg or pdf and trying to

345
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
print that can so but i uploaded it it

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
accepted that no problem but i wasn't

347
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,480
going to print it because it just looked

348
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,880
terrible

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
posted on a bunch of forums the kdp

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
forum was just horrible

351
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
i actually had like a little flashback

352
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
because i archived all this before i

353
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
deleted everything off of there

354
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
and they're just getting like beaten up

355
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
and all these people telling me the same

356
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
thing over over and i was an idiot and i

357
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
was like this is just useless

358
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
um went on the frame maker forum

359
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
illustrator acrobat

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
everybody stumped i actually hired a

361
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
friend maker expert

362
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,279
who's a consultant really experienced

363
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,040
and stuff they had no idea what this

364
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
error meant or what any of the things we

365
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
could do

366
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,079
it's the only thing anybody told me so

367
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,880
again all he's trying to do was change

368
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,320
the words master and sleeve out of the

369
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
book that was it like three sentences

370
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
update the you know copyright page that

371
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
was it

372
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,320
oh anybody could tell me like well of

373
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
course you just replace all the graphics

374
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
there's literally like 200 graphics and

375
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
they're basically just direct imported

376
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
from adobe illustrator so just like

377
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
placed in frame maker and they're just

378
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,959
telling oh just redo them all i'm like

379
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
no i'm not you know

380
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
um wasn't going to do that

381
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
so but that basically would mean just

382
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,320
starting over to do that i do in

383
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,680
indesign and as i said just trying to

384
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
change a few words so i tried everything

385
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
i could i did every format every export

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
thing every setting and what's kind of

387
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,279
hilarious now not sure if you can read

388
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,600
that but it turns out once you create

389
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,079
these kdp projects you can't delete them

390
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,639
so permanently up there are projects it

391
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
says kdp

392
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,720
this is horrible

393
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
amazon is destroyed print on demand all

394
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
these things and this is now still

395
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
linked to my amazon account so if i go

396
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
up there and if i look in kdp there's

397
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,800
just these lists of projects it's like

398
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
 amazon

399
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
all this over and over and you cannot

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,839
delete them again the excitement of this

401
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
system so then i got to escalate the

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
technical team

403
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
they you can't speak to them directly

404
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
and they respond three to five business

405
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
days so you can imagine how well this

406
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
went and then all they could do was

407
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
really um

408
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,120
they well get to a little bit a little

409
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
bit of detail they offered me eventually

410
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
they couldn't tell me if it was a

411
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
problem with one graphic or all of them

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,680
uh because if it's one graphic sure i

413
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
would redo it but they're just sort of

414
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,639
like oh reset it redo everything start

415
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,079
over i'm like i'm not doing that i'm

416
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,440
just trying to change like three words

417
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
in this book

418
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,079
um and what all i could get was that the

419
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,639
interior file contains complex graphics

420
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,000
and multiple layers and the file

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
features contain complex vector images

422
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
okay um so basically it's an illustrator

423
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,199
graphic they're not telling me like oh

424
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,279
you can only have three layers it can be

425
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
this dpi or whatever there's no useful

426
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
information in that but this is what it

427
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
looked like in their pre-press systems

428
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,320
they just said oh here's the problem it

429
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,839
looks like this i'm like

430
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
great thanks i mean this is what it's

431
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
supposed to look like this is a lighting

432
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
console

433
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
not from the one the company that's back

434
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
there um

435
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
and again what's insane about all this

436
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,399
the file that was giving them all the

437
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,320
errors they were printing virtually the

438
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
same file because all i did was change a

439
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,399
couple words in it the interior pdf was

440
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,839
still there they're still printing and

441
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
selling it so it was in the system as

442
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
printing i but i take the same thing

443
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,240
change three words now i can't print it

444
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,959
so after all this it was like 10 days of

445
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
this nonsense in like 50 hours i guess i

446
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,079
actually trapped it i i have a

447
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,079
if this is actually interesting you have

448
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,079
a whole blog entry that lays out all the

449
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,600
details and notes i took at the time

450
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
which is why i remember all this stuff

451
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
um so i'm like okay i give up i'm going

452
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,759
to lead master and slave in the book i'm

453
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
going to write a blog entry about why i

454
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
can't change it and i'll just i'll have

455
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
to live with it

456
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,800
so i said i go in there there's no way

457
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
to revert back to the old file the one

458
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
they're printing i can't revert back to

459
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,040
it so

460
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
i caught them up and said hey can you do

461
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
it and it turns out no they can't do it

462
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
because they delete it once you upload a

463
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,199
new file they delete the old one

464
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,600
no warning nothing you can't no none of

465
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
this stuff so now i got the tier two

466
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,399
escalation very exciting um so they said

467
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
why don't you find the old file and

468
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
upload it i'm like okay great so i did

469
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
that and you can imagine what happened

470
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
when i uploaded this is the file they're

471
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
printing

472
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
error processing interior so

473
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,199
literally i mean at that time you could

474
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
buy this book that had the master and

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
slave language in it

476
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,600
from this pdf that i made in 2017 now

477
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
i'm taking the same thing uploading it

478
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
back into their system now i get this

479
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
air processing interior thing so you can

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
imagine how excited i was at that point

481
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
then i found out you i don't know if it

482
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,319
still works but there was an email

483
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,199
called jeff at amazon.com uh they do

484
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
actually answer it

485
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
it's kind of ridiculous it says jeff

486
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,959
bezos has received your email it's like

487
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,679
oh come on um he asked that i respond on

488
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,119
his behalf like okay maybe maybe once so

489
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
blah blah blah the only way this file

490
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,799
will be ingested if you rasterize the

491
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
same thing which i'm not very sure what

492
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
that means there actually are raster

493
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,880
files already um

494
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
i can't tell you anything there's some

495
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
commotion out there

496
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
so then here's the key i am aware that

497
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
the file may have had no issues prior to

498
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
this when uploaded to create space but

499
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
the new specifications will have to be

500
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
adhered to in order to publish the

501
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,520
change of your book okay great what are

502
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,000
the specifications they they don't have

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,559
them there's like a bullet page uh sorry

504
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
a web page with like 10 bullet points i

505
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
think i have a screenshot of that coming

506
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,960
up

507
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
and then they tell me oh go get an

508
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
expert i'm like okay now i'm just

509
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,679
screwed

510
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,720
um

511
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
so the the back and forth and then

512
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
eventually they just kicked me back to

513
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
tech support so i think now i should

514
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,919
point out that you know

515
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,880
uh

516
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,000
at this time amazon had sold my very

517
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
various additions in my book and had

518
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
grossed like 222 thousand dollars so

519
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
i'm not asking i'm not like this isn't

520
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
millions i get it but i think if you

521
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
sell 200 000 with a product should at

522
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
least have somebody who understands

523
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
their system just take a look at the

524
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,679
file and go oh

525
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,840
this thing that we're selling today

526
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
here's the issue fix that boom boom you

527
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
can't do it it's just one system you go

528
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
in maybe this has changed since then i

529
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,799
kind of doubt it um and i should mention

530
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
too

531
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
over that eight years i had made like

532
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
almost 100 000 to the royalties so it

533
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
was worth it for me to do all this

534
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
but at this point my book is just stuck

535
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
and so this is why i say it's in

536
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
purgatory it's probably can't see it on

537
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
the screen but it says

538
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
live with unpublished changes so you

539
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
could still buy it but the unpublished

540
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,760
changes were the new file i was trying

541
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,679
to upload which they won't print and

542
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,360
they deleted the old file so this is why

543
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,840
i say it's in purgatory i was just stuck

544
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,039
um

545
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,799
and the yeah the basically the error

546
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
that's still there is the interior files

547
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
we're just stuck on this whole thing and

548
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
there's no you know if they said okay

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
you have to invest this time and do this

550
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
and that'll fix it here's the problem

551
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
it's 18 layers here's the problem is

552
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,559
this it's the wrong color space any

553
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,559
information that was useful other than

554
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,880
rasterize the graphics these are you

555
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
know

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
it doesn't it just doesn't i don't know

557
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
why it doesn't make sense and that's

558
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
basically i mean i'm not a pdf expert

559
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,760
but this is you know part of the pdf

560
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
export process from frame maker is to

561
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
find the graphics so they're not giving

562
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
me enough specification on what to what

563
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,039
to fix this

564
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
and again i hired a friend maker expert

565
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
they didn't know what they were talking

566
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
about so it's not just me so i'm like

567
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
okay there's a competitor to amazon

568
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
called ingramspark i set up an account

569
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
over there

570
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
i took the 2017 file

571
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
that amazon was printing uploaded to

572
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
ingramspark what happened

573
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
they accepted the first try

574
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,919
so the same pdf that amazon's telling me

575
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
is unprintable with no changes

576
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
whatsoever ingram just took it printed

577
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,919
it no problem hey there's some error

578
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,679
about the resolution of this photo or

579
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
whatever that's offline

580
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,200
went right through no problem saying

581
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
okay great i'm just going to move my you

582
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
know i owned all the isbn numbers all

583
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
the stuff i'm just going to move my

584
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
stuff out of amazon put on ingram and i

585
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,600
ironically ingram will sell through

586
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
amazon so it'll still be available but

587
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,280
they just won't print it

588
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
um so what happens is the and this gets

589
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
really boring but

590
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
kdp has this thing called expanded

591
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,280
distribution which allows it to be sold

592
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
just beyond you know inside amazon

593
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,120
directly

594
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
that will go to some bookstores and

595
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,799
things like that i had enrolled in that

596
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,039
because i you know i have classes that

597
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
use this book and stuff um and the why

598
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
couldn't i de-enroll from an expanded

599
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,679
distribution

600
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,799
it's still in setup at kdp because

601
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,559
error processing interior so i'm still

602
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
back in the same so i can't even so the

603
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
file that i own which they won't print

604
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,960
which is printable by their competitor

605
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
the isbn that i own they won't release

606
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,880
it because it's in their expanded

607
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
distribution program which i can't get

608
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
out of because they won't take my print

609
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,559
files so it's just like the man

610
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
so that was the end that was it so i had

611
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
sold over the years

612
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,760
5100 copies and i just had it i'm like

613
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
all right i gotta i have to get out of

614
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,400
this and all along um oh i shouldn't

615
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
mention i was getting this talk ready

616
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
the uh i got a royalty for one cent a

617
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
couple days ago so there's enrolled in

618
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,280
some old kindle loaner program where

619
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
it's like by page is read so somebody

620
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
read a couple pages last week or so or

621
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
last month and i got a one cent royalty

622
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,799
from them and i'm like i now i just i

623
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,159
don't go back and uh and go go into it

624
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,200
so in summary for me

625
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,760
again the people i spoke to at the kdp

626
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
tech support wherever they are

627
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,720
super helpful they were very nice people

628
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
they empathize with my problem they were

629
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,159
trying to help but they just didn't have

630
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
the tool set to do it maybe this has

631
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
been fixed i did send my blog entry back

632
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,520
to that jeff

633
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,720
amazon.com email right about the time i

634
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,520
sold my amazon stock and the uh of

635
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
course heard nothing back but i mean

636
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
they've been made aware of this i don't

637
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
know if they chose to

638
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
fix it i'm not going to go find out at

639
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
this point um so i get that they're not

640
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
you know they're they don't know frame

641
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
maker nobody knew frame maker i don't

642
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,679
expect them to like tell me how to run

643
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,679
illustrator or whatever but you have to

644
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
give people enough detailed information

645
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,559
to to fix the problem

646
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
by by comparison

647
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,640
excuse me

648
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,679
um

649
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,240
ingramspark has a 40 page pre-press

650
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
guide all the details everything in

651
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
there and then the key part is they give

652
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
you this thing called an adobe i i

653
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
couldn't find it when i would look for

654
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
the other day but i got it at the time

655
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
this thing called a job options file so

656
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
basically you just take acrobat you load

657
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,120
up this job option file it exports it

658
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
exactly how they want it everything's

659
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
good but i'll say the the file they were

660
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
they said was printable

661
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,159
um

662
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,360
i hadn't even run through that i just

663
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
did the basic export everything worked

664
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
so this is all a kdp prompt

665
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
obviously amazon shouldn't be like

666
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
deleting your project when you upload a

667
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
new version until the new version is

668
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
working

669
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
um and they should tell you what's

670
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,440
what's happening with that

671
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
that's going to go on

672
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
kind of common sense stuff so all that

673
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,400
said is kdp right for you i think that

674
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
it seems to me and this is again from

675
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,159
2020 seems like kdp i'm completely

676
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
speculating here but it seems like

677
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,840
amazon just wasn't making enough money

678
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
on people like me even though again i

679
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
sold 200 000 of the books with them

680
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,400
um to make it worth having this upper

681
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,159
level tier of support and again i'm not

682
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
expecting like you know special

683
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,600
treatment i just wanted somebody one

684
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
person i could talk to who can answer my

685
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
my uh problem it seems like

686
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
that now they're really oriented so

687
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
we're more towards hobbyists so somebody

688
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,799
wants to publish their memoir they're

689
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,640
going to sell five copies of it they're

690
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
going to send in a word file

691
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,159
all that is fine they'll give you a

692
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,480
template in word or whatever so again

693
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,240
i'm totally speculating i mean amazon

694
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
wouldn't tell me if i asked but that

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
seems like that's what happened like

696
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
there was a successful niche for them

697
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
maybe ingram took it over or whatever um

698
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,919
but now it's like if you so if you have

699
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,240
something very simple or like a novel or

700
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,919
something with with not a lot of

701
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,640
graphics it probably works fine i i

702
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,080
still think i would go with ingram today

703
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
anyway

704
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,960
um and all them and ingram both offer

705
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
like production services so if you just

706
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,000
want to write something you want to hire

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
somebody lay it out do the cover all

708
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
that

709
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
they can do the whole package for you

710
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,720
and so things could have changed but

711
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,880
 them at this point it's like after

712
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
what they put me and also you know i

713
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,279
 amazon in general i think so

714
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
um so in the meantime so the final

715
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,279
result of that is the what i call the

716
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,159
big book i got it out on ingram in 2021.

717
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,559
i had to get a new isbn mine was stuck

718
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,320
mine that i own i should say i mean i

719
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,640
paid for it i own it if they're stuck in

720
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
their system and again

721
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,240
there is no one who would just say hey

722
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
we'll override that and fix this for you

723
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,600
like it's just

724
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
it's like you know the the database is

725
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,080
the database no one can challenge it

726
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
it's like it's in there no one can touch

727
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,159
it it makes the final determination and

728
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,000
there's no human that they will make

729
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
available to me that can go in and like

730
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,000
unplug the thing and fix it um

731
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,200
i'm sorry

732
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
yeah but well i'm i'm you're probably

733
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,279
right but i

734
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,520
it's just possible to do and i bought an

735
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
isbn separate from them that does not

736
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
i'm the publisher so my my number is in

737
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,440
there not theirs

738
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,039
when you set these up you can get an

739
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,200
isbn from them

740
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
as part of sort of the package deal i

741
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,720
didn't do that i got my own separate

742
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
from them i uploaded it so i'm the

743
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
publisher the zircon design is my

744
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
publisher

745
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,360
um so i unpublished the the kdp edition

746
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
um

747
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
in the new version i lowered the price

748
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,159
um

749
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,240
and then in the long run this book is

750
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
sort of the end of the line for this

751
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
thing uh mostly that's due to the market

752
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,960
the market now you know this this stuff

753
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
the low-level details aren't as

754
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
important as it used to be so now uh

755
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,039
networking is where it's at so the new

756
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,799
books about networking that and this is

757
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,120
this was all sort of the plan anyway um

758
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
but i didn't really want it to end like

759
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,880
this you know so um

760
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,600
so i wanted to keep some uh version

761
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,240
available they they would do the kindle

762
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,159
uh print replica but them i'm not

763
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,240
giving them money for it i don't want to

764
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
do it but i found this thing and i was

765
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
looking for this i talked about this in

766
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
the original talk 2014

767
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
that i wanted in those days to get like

768
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
an individually watermarked pdf drm free

769
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,039
pdf i couldn't find that then but i

770
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,919
could find it now so i got this thing

771
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
through this company called dpd and you

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
get individually uh watermark pdf there

773
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,240
may be other solutions now this cost me

774
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,720
about 120 bucks a year right now i'm

775
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
sort of i'm losing a little bit of money

776
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
running it but i wanted to keep the

777
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
thing available in some electronic form

778
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,399
and the um

779
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,080
if you can see that the

780
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,399
um the watermark down there this is sort

781
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,080
of the template but it just comes up and

782
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,840
it puts on the bottom of every page a

783
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
little thing that says who bought it

784
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,039
their email obviously you could fake

785
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,880
this but it's just a disincentive to

786
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,159
take the thing if you want to loan it to

787
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,760
your friend i don't care but if you want

788
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
to publish it online at least would be

789
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,279
traceable some way to find out who it is

790
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,200
i haven't gone looking for it uh there

791
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,799
haven't been that many sales of it let's

792
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,279
make it worth it but i it is an exciting

793
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,520
solution if you have a book i think now

794
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,039
because this is just a pdf you can do

795
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,720
whatever you like with it the i think

796
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,399
the individual watermark you know is a

797
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,159
good sort of disincentive just to like

798
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,720
put it online for free um but again if

799
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
you want to share it you want to send it

800
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
to your cousin whether that's great it's

801
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,679
sort of like that's what it should be in

802
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,120
the print version

803
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,559
so i kind of jumped that order in the

804
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,919
timeline here

805
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,760
because in the meantime

806
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
while i had the time during the lockdown

807
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
i wanted to make this other book so the

808
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,600
process for that is i wrote this over

809
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
summer and fall so i exported out of

810
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
frame maker basically each chapter was

811
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,080
an rtf document i was pretty surprised

812
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,679
at how much of the formatting sort of

813
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
survived that coming out of there into

814
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,960
indesign which is where and i just write

815
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
just write it right in indesign i'll

816
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
talk about that in a minute i did have

817
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,919
to reset all the graphics because it's

818
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,120
only it's a much smaller version um

819
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,600
the uh it wasn't as many so it was

820
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,279
pretty manageable hired a graphic

821
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,399
designer make a nice layout um and then

822
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
when we were making this layout

823
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
the we had the epub had the electronic

824
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,559
version in mind from the beginning so

825
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,120
the old layout i had made in 2012 or

826
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,840
whenever that was really wasn't i did

827
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,360
wasn't thinking about

828
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
you know epub electronic books back then

829
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
just think about the print layout so

830
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
it's much more complicated than it

831
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
probably needed to be but it looked nice

832
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
on the page and things were in the right

833
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
place and all that stuff

834
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
so now we just made a much more

835
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,159
simplified layout with epub in mind i

836
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,919
talked about that and then oh yeah i

837
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
should mention this is that ingram table

838
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,440
of contents this is the information they

839
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,559
give you which is very detailed uh so if

840
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
you and if you're not an expert in this

841
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
which i'm not you can give this to a

842
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,159
graphics expert they go oh of course

843
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,960
it's pdf x blah blah blah it's this and

844
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
it's it's there all the information is

845
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,600
there

846
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
so the way how we came up with it you

847
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,919
know

848
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
has some graphic elements but some of

849
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,440
this stuff which will be in the print

850
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,279
edition or is in the print edition

851
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,120
doesn't just doesn't go into the epub

852
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
and that's fine but everything else is

853
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
basically just sort of inline graphics

854
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
and i made a smaller version and all

855
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
that

856
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
and it came out i think pretty good in

857
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,320
there

858
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
so the process of that i hired the

859
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,919
original illustrator to update some

860
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,399
things hired a copy editor and then

861
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,640
uploading ingram was very smooth

862
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,559
basically the way kindle's the same way

863
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,039
basically you get your file in you

864
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,120
upload it you approve it online so you

865
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,200
look at it did it accept properly does

866
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
everything look right and then i still

867
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,919
like to order a proof copy

868
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,279
and get that and look at it before i

869
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,960
sort of release hit that release button

870
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,799
so i did that and i'm glad i did that

871
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,200
because i screwed up the cover um

872
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
on this thing i just had the like the

873
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
with wrong or something and i had to

874
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,640
redo it one time and that you know it

875
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,799
cost a little bit money um

876
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,039
and then i did something to try to kind

877
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
of keep it you know this is all during

878
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
the lockdown times and everything and

879
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,360
again i was pretty aggravated in amazon

880
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,200
at that point um but one of the things

881
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,840
this is true with kdp as well is you can

882
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,399
buy the the uh copies yourself that

883
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,559
basically print costs so it's like

884
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,159
they're just buying it for a few dollars

885
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
a copy i don't remember the exact number

886
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
off top of my head and then you can do

887
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
whatever you like with it you can give

888
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
them away like today you can sell them

889
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,679
so what i did is i the only place i made

890
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,240
it available was from a small company in

891
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,960
our industry that's founded by small

892
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,559
friends of mine that has a you know

893
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,919
really good reputation that's also

894
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,080
related this topic so i worked out a

895
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
deal with them i'm like they're just

896
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
they'll be the only ones who can sell

897
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
the print edition i knew i was gonna

898
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,519
make an epub version eventually um and

899
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,200
then we did that for a while and then

900
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,360
basically after a couple months of that

901
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
you just basically click a button and

902
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,039
the ingram website and then it releases

903
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,000
it out to everybody

904
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
and everybody in ingram is it's a lot of

905
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
channels um and one thing that's

906
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,720
definitely better about ingram than kdp

907
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
is that libraries can buy i don't know

908
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
exactly why all that works out but the

909
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,960
kindle world like you know if you have a

910
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,320
library that wants to get it for a

911
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
collection there's basically no way for

912
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
them to get it ingram is they sell to

913
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
everybody bookstores and they do sell

914
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
back through amazon so ingram will print

915
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,919
it and it goes back to amazon all the

916
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,000
major bookstores even walmart i can't

917
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,559
imagine i've sold many walmart um and

918
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,679
then overseas and uh uk and europe and

919
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,519
then also australia and new zealand so

920
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,279
it prints all over the place i think

921
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
they have i believe ingram has three

922
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,440
print facilities i think one in

923
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,279
california one in europe somewhere and

924
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,799
then one in australia they had a big one

925
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,320
in australia they were moving for a long

926
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,640
time uh and now all this stuff was a

927
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,240
little bit slow during this sort of

928
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,919
lockdown time but everything seems to be

929
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,240
back up to speed now which is great so

930
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,760
and now they're like really aggressive

931
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
like trying to get new people into their

932
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,480
system

933
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,519
um

934
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
yeah i used to the only way to get it to

935
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,039
libraries i would just donate it because

936
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,720
they couldn't buy it through the system

937
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
and my school bookstore you know i'd use

938
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,679
it in class and i had to wholesale it

939
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
myself to our bookstore uh which is not

940
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,320
used to sell buying from individual

941
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,399
people so they could then sell it back

942
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
to the students that some students on

943
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,519
financial aid can only buy through the

944
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,120
bookstore and stuff like that but

945
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
through ingram you just say hey it's on

946
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,000
ingram they're like oh okay great and

947
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,679
that's it and they it goes to their

948
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,519
normal channels they get their discount

949
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,200
wholesale discount everything's fine

950
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
also ingram has a thing that's pretty

951
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
cool called aereo

952
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
and what that

953
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
what that does is allows it's sort of

954
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,799
your own store in that goes direct to

955
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,039
ingram so this way like this is just a

956
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,880
screen capture for my website yeah i

957
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
just got some embedding code from them

958
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
stick on the website if you click on

959
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,919
that it just comes up you goes uh you

960
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
don't know you just you're buying and

961
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
processing and putting your shipping

962
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,799
address in everything what you're

963
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,159
actually dealing with is going directly

964
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,919
to ingram they print and send it to you

965
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,159
directly and then i get the royalties i

966
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,919
would normally get plus i get a little

967
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,039
additional kickback uh from from ariel

968
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,120
on that and that's also true in amazon

969
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,760
through kdp and even not through kdp you

970
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,279
know they have a referral code so i have

971
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,120
a little button on my website so if you

972
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,480
buy it on amazon through there i get an

973
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
extra dollar or something uh you know

974
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,158
for all this stuff

975
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,960
uh cons of ingram is there a little bit

976
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
slower than amazon to ship because

977
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,720
they're not amazon right they don't have

978
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
all these warehouses all over the place

979
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
sales reporting and i think this is true

980
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,440
with all of them they they could make

981
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
all the sales reporting better but

982
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,799
ingram because they sell through these

983
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,640
three mechanisms it's a little you get

984
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
like three statements every month and

985
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,120
like oh you sold one copy in the uk and

986
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
two in australia and they're all in

987
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
different currencies and it comes in so

988
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,839
that's a little bit confusing but it's

989
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
it's manageable and i just in

990
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,119
preparation for the slides you're going

991
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,239
to see in a couple minutes i had to

992
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,839
spend like a day going back through all

993
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,599
these old statements but now i got a

994
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,879
spreadsheet i'm just going to process

995
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
every month to look at it because it's

996
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,440
kind of fun to see like where is it

997
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,159
selling and all that stuff

998
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,918
the yeah it doesn't have that there's no

999
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,520
real analytics in there which i find

1000
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,800
frustrating because you know they have

1001
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
it they know exactly who they sold it to

1002
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,639
they know exactly if it went through the

1003
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,000
aero system uh whatever they don't pass

1004
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
that on to me i wish that i wish they

1005
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,320
would i talked about that oh one other

1006
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,119
thing that was a bit of a surprise that

1007
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,560
i guess amazon probably just doesn't

1008
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,079
accept returns or i'm not sure what they

1009
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,239
do but but because ingram sells to

1010
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,879
bookstores bookstores uh you know if

1011
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,040
they buy 10 copies and they only sell

1012
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,839
four

1013
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,440
they have the ability to send those six

1014
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
back to the publisher so the publisher

1015
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,599
is me so in once in a while i just get a

1016
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,760
box out of the blue that's some return

1017
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,359
copies and they're usually like oh all

1018
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,560
this handling they're not gonna be good

1019
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,320
but they they usually look fine like i

1020
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,400
think that's what this copy was um so

1021
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,599
that's just something that's part of

1022
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,359
that i have to eat that cost coming back

1023
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,800
but that makes it flexible for a

1024
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,640
bookstore doesn't want to get stuck with

1025
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,960
a bunch of books they can't sell

1026
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,839
um one really stupid thing you can never

1027
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,240
change your login email so i discovered

1028
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,480
this because i consolidate all my emails

1029
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
and i can't change this one i was like

1030
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,680
really confused i had to like contact

1031
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,599
their tech support they're like oh sorry

1032
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,680
can't change it so

1033
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,280
um so for the ebook for this one

1034
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,960
i went to google play books and i have

1035
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,079
to say

1036
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,680
whatever issues with all these giant

1037
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
corporations if i could only print do

1038
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,359
print on demand through one outlet it

1039
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,400
would be them

1040
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
because it's just the easiest thing like

1041
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
the epub goes in with no problem if you

1042
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,480
write this in

1043
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,680
indesign

1044
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
you just click the button that says

1045
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
export to epub it comes out it's done

1046
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,920
no problem um and then they you get 70

1047
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,599
of whatever the sales are so i'm selling

1048
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,440
this for 15 so i get 70 70 of that which

1049
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
is a reasonable amount and kindle you

1050
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
get less because they kind of it's a

1051
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,960
very closed off market i can't remember

1052
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,520
the exact royalty off top of my head but

1053
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,280
this one's just clean you sell it for

1054
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
ten dollars they get three you get seven

1055
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
that seems reasonable they got i mean

1056
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,560
but all they're doing is distributing a

1057
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,480
file and running a website right so it's

1058
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,119
not which they google does a lot of them

1059
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,560
um

1060
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
talk about that so they do

1061
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
analytics probably the wrong word you

1062
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,760
don't really get the sort of search

1063
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,599
traffic that you would through like

1064
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,280
google normally but you do get pretty

1065
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,520
detailed reporting i don't know like

1066
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
name and address who bought it but i can

1067
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
see oh there's a sale in the state from

1068
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
this country they paid this

1069
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
all that kind of stuff

1070
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
wherever you buy it from i get paid in

1071
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,359
u.s dollars just makes it simpler for me

1072
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,880
and then one really really nice thing

1073
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
about this that kindle did not do and

1074
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,280
again i'm two years out of kindle so

1075
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
this could have changed but kindle would

1076
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,599
allow you to either do 100 discount

1077
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,280
which i did i talked about this in the

1078
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,680
talk from 2014. i did like pay what you

1079
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
will dis promotion where you just sort

1080
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,480
of give it away um but google allows you

1081
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,800
to do percentages dollars off all that

1082
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,760
kind of stuff or 100 discounts so that's

1083
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
how i do academic copies now

1084
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
the

1085
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
so if you teach an institution you want

1086
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
to evaluate the book

1087
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
i just

1088
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
send you a link you get it you download

1089
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,680
the thing and you do have to have a

1090
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
gmail address to access the account but

1091
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
otherwise it works and i think i bought

1092
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,400
it myself to test it i ran it on my

1093
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,640
tablet my phone it seems fine i couldn't

1094
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,160
i had a couple little minor issues with

1095
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
it but there's always something

1096
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,560
seemed to work pretty well so

1097
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,359
so now to me that's how academic copies

1098
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,119
i used to have to under create space i

1099
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,640
would just buy a copy and ship it

1100
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,839
somewhere because they would do

1101
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,520
international shipping and all that now

1102
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
i just send a link and this is also true

1103
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,720
for publishers like if you

1104
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,200
uh uh or a publisher or professor i get

1105
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,320
an email once in a while like hey

1106
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,079
there's a new book to evaluate they're

1107
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,280
not going to send you a print edition

1108
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
anymore

1109
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
also it's you can see over here this is

1110
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,119
also my website but the um

1111
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
that's also in google book search so you

1112
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
can search right inside it uh and that's

1113
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
i've had that for a long since i've been

1114
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
some self-publishing only had one

1115
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
complaint about the google format

1116
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
somebody emailed me they really wanted

1117
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
an apple i just explained the situation

1118
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,280
and they're like oh great that was it so

1119
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
so promotions i gave away 100 copies of

1120
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,160
the print edition

1121
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
to unemployed people in my business

1122
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
because the entertainment industry was

1123
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
just decimated by the pandemic so you

1124
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
know i i did it for that it also of

1125
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
course is a self-promotion thing got

1126
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,720
some positive reviews and some magazines

1127
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
and stuff like that got on some podcasts

1128
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,119
so it's if you're in whatever industry

1129
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,040
you're trying to reach you you already

1130
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
know how to do this stuff and the

1131
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
publishers just aren't doing it i did a

1132
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,119
rehearsal this talk and uh had a couple

1133
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,720
friends of mine in there who have been

1134
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,079
dealing with the publisher more recently

1135
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,240
they said basically nothing's changed uh

1136
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
which is unfortunate so here's the

1137
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,800
economics of this thing uh so far i've

1138
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,599
sold 1100 copies so this is the last

1139
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,440
sorry the print edition the last 21

1140
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
months 107 ebooks so i'll talk about

1141
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that in a second but still and i'm the

1142
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,920
same way if i'm reading complex text

1143
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,680
information i just want wanted a paper

1144
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
so i like to have the ebook to search it

1145
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,040
but uh

1146
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,960
so that grossed about 17 000 over that i

1147
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
and this is a very rough number i think

1148
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
i out of pocket was maybe about five

1149
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
grand so i hired graphic designer for

1150
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
like maybe 1500 bucks copy editor

1151
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000
illustrator that was a few thousand most

1152
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,520
of the setup call you could do if you do

1153
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
this yourself you don't have to pay that

1154
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
and if you're not worried about typos

1155
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,800
you don't have to hire a copy editor i

1156
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
had a copy editor in the business who

1157
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
was great

1158
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
the cost to actually get in the system

1159
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,839
are pretty minimal

1160
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,440
maybe a couple hundred dollars if you

1161
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,520
want to print a book it's um and so the

1162
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,280
way i always calculate this out is like

1163
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
i think it's a every book to me is

1164
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,440
really about a year to write it but i

1165
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
would say about 400 hours so probably

1166
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,680
like and i i can't write this kind of

1167
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,359
information like eight hours a day i

1168
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,400
have to do

1169
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
like four hours and do something else so

1170
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,960
i would say roughly about 400 hours so i

1171
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,040
think somewhere in there i'm taking in

1172
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,200
about 30 an hour so that's of course

1173
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,319
pre-tax office expense computer all that

1174
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,520
kind of stuff but if you look at it sort

1175
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
of like a consulting rate that's about

1176
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
where i am on it i'm and i'm happy with

1177
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,800
that i mean i don't the

1178
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,640
it's actual money it's worth doing but i

1179
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,160
mean i could go be a stage hand and make

1180
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
more money than that but it's it's

1181
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
rewarding for me i end up doing talks

1182
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,079
like this and i and you have you know

1183
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,280
get out there in the industry a little

1184
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
bit uh the old book which i really

1185
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,560
thought was just gonna die out is it

1186
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
confusing to me is still kind of popular

1187
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,400
that sold 500 copies only 14 ebooks uh

1188
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
there might be i have a reason for that

1189
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,480
second that again on that i made and

1190
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,160
that was much lower hours because it's

1191
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,960
really just uh making those changes and

1192
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,160
then i think amazon cost me 100 hours on

1193
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
that so this would be more money except

1194
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,920
that they just wasted all my time on

1195
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
this stuff

1196
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,359
so here's from 2014 presentation

1197
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,680
same kind of thing

1198
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,160
back then so i think in this this book

1199
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
every edition is selling around about 2

1200
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,599
000 copies i i this one could sell more

1201
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,440
in the long run i'm not sure but that's

1202
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
just sort of you know i kind of saturate

1203
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,119
the industry it's still really the only

1204
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,000
book on the topic out there um and all

1205
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,440
those things and it's been around a long

1206
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,079
time now um so the hourly rates back

1207
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,319
then back on the older book which was

1208
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,839
priced much higher

1209
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,960
had twice the price of this one

1210
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
um obviously the income's higher and my

1211
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,800
rate was higher um i think that's one

1212
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
mistake if i was just looking at this a

1213
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,400
pure business aspect i probably should

1214
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,079
have priced this book a little higher

1215
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,240
and you can see the old additions again

1216
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,040
back to the 90s everyone's two to three

1217
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,359
thousand copies that seems to be in my

1218
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
market like sort of the saturation point

1219
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,200
um i talked to that

1220
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,720
right so i'm still very happy with this

1221
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
whole thing because i now i feel like

1222
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,240
this thing is in a good position for the

1223
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,079
future there's a great thing called the

1224
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,720
audio nerd book club there's a discord

1225
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,040
run on a discord server out of a sound

1226
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
podcast uh they're going through the

1227
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,319
book right now and i'm sort of looking

1228
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,160
at it with fresh eyes with i'm zooming

1229
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
with them every week and i'm seeing now

1230
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,440
like oh here's some stuff for the second

1231
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
edition but i'm not at that point yet

1232
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,640
but i'm still kind of baffled while the

1233
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
older one which is now at least five

1234
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,400
years old is still selling as well as it

1235
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,119
is

1236
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,280
um i'm not i don't quite understand that

1237
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,200
but i in the long run i plan to extract

1238
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
the still relevant information out of

1239
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,599
that put in another book as well

1240
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
print book is still far more popular

1241
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,359
so the ebook in this in this book is

1242
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,000
only about nine percent of the total

1243
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,480
sales and for the big book it's only

1244
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
like two and a half percent that could

1245
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
be right now because they're not sort of

1246
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
an integrated platform because when i

1247
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,720
was selling on amazon you buy print or

1248
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
kindle is all in the same you know it's

1249
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,319
like one different click

1250
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
but even then the e-book sales were much

1251
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
lower uh than the print ones i find this

1252
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
kind of fascinating um what i would love

1253
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,160
to do which i haven't been able to find

1254
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,760
a way to do is like if you buy the print

1255
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,599
edition i'd love to give you the ebook

1256
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,200
but i just never found a mechanism to

1257
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
that that doesn't involve me like

1258
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,119
getting an email from a thousand people

1259
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,079
and like sending a code out so

1260
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
um so do i recommend self-publishing uh

1261
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,000
absolutely again

1262
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,520
if you have a book to sell a million

1263
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,280
copies and publishers are gonna probably

1264
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,680
come find you that's great but for this

1265
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
for like trade book the pub there's

1266
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,400
really one publisher in our industry in

1267
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,680
the live entertainment technology

1268
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,319
industry they are so i just again i

1269
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,839
checked with some friends like last week

1270
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,520
about this everything i wrote on the

1271
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,680
slide in 2014

1272
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,800
is still

1273
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,520
true and not true for them so i think

1274
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,880
and i think that is interesting like

1275
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
down here downstairs here is a couple

1276
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
publishers i think they meet these

1277
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,839
criteria right they have a strong

1278
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,400
identity they offer credibility

1279
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,680
which means the publishers are like

1280
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,359
vetting the books the big publisher in

1281
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,800
our industry really doesn't vet anything

1282
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,720
anymore and it's not you know there's

1283
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,319
very nice people well-meaning people

1284
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,880
that work there but they are not you

1285
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,240
know entertainment technology people

1286
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,839
they don't know the material and there's

1287
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,520
no one at the company that does and then

1288
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,960
everybody's there for like six months

1289
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,640
they move on to something else so it's

1290
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
just structurally broken in that way so

1291
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,280
i the one big thing is i think i'm like

1292
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,640
full professor i don't have to worry

1293
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,880
about this anymore but if you're worried

1294
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,240
about tenured promotion i think a

1295
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
publisher would probably even this one

1296
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,839
that i don't like in our industry would

1297
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,520
probably offer you some credibility

1298
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
probably not a valid credibility given

1299
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,640
what i just said um

1300
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,560
and then they do they take everything

1301
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,839
off your plate you're basically just

1302
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,839
uploading something send them a word

1303
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,319
file and the rest comes out um but i

1304
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,000
think there's a lot of there's a lot of

1305
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
issues with that

1306
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,960
um

1307
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,800
i think i talked about yeah and the

1308
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,240
other thing is

1309
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,000
the publishers and i believe this again

1310
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,440
i'm mostly talking about experience with

1311
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,040
one publisher the dominant publisher in

1312
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,720
our industry but they don't even really

1313
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,880
engage with the authors i mean they once

1314
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,400
it's printed like they sell it they go

1315
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,680
to a trade show or whatever but they

1316
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,520
don't be like hey we notice that's

1317
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,200
selling at these universities but not

1318
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,880
this one or how about this or whatever

1319
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,560
there's it's just sort of like they just

1320
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,119
have an old mindset about it i think um

1321
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,599
and then what's insane is their ebook

1322
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,920
version of the old edition which is now

1323
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,880
what i don't know five six years old um

1324
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,560
with just a clear pdf they would just

1325
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,640
email you they lost it so you can still

1326
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
find that on the web i used to find

1327
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,920
copies of it and i would tell the

1328
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,839
publisher and they're like oh thanks and

1329
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,760
then they go find it i'm like you're

1330
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
taking ninety percent of the money you

1331
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,040
should be doing this yourself you know

1332
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,680
so i had to find a pirated copy so now

1333
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,960
these days i just don't look because

1334
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
it's too aggravating

1335
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,000
um so again

1336
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,640
given that if you're writing uh i would

1337
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,920
say for almost anything because the

1338
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,359
other thing about self-publishing is i

1339
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,680
own every bit of it if a publisher came

1340
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,119
in here tomorrow and i don't know why

1341
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,800
this would happen but so we want to give

1342
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,079
you a million dollars to this book i'm

1343
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,839
like great i'm going to unclick this

1344
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,839
thing online here you go

1345
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,920
but so even if you have something like

1346
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,520
uh you know i told a friend of mine

1347
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,720
who's writing like you know sort of

1348
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,240
fiction book i'm like i still would

1349
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,520
self-publish it you just get it out

1350
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,280
there start building a little audience

1351
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,040
and then somebody wants it then you just

1352
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,359
do it that way so i still recommend that

1353
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,760
um and anybody i think to me writing

1354
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
basically anything maybe i mean a

1355
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,800
fiction but

1356
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,400
any sort of technical book i always just

1357
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,560
say write a blog maybe start a podcast

1358
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,000
or something else with a friend of mine

1359
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,680
the guy who copied in my book's about to

1360
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,119
release his own book about a different

1361
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,599
topic he's got a podcast audience now

1362
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,680
you know 50 000 people every week

1363
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,720
there's your audience like the

1364
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,119
marketing's done

1365
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,960
it is additional work i mean if i think

1366
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,800
if you're at this convention you have a

1367
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,720
kind of hacker mindset this stuff is

1368
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
kind of fascinating to me obviously even

1369
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,400
with this nightmare with amazon uh i i

1370
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,920
don't really regret ever having gone

1371
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,200
through it i wish i mean i would still

1372
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,560
be with amazon today if they hadn't

1373
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,079
 this up

1374
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,119
um

1375
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,040
talked about that oh and the other thing

1376
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,440
like by self-publishing it i can do

1377
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,359
lecture videos so i have i did this for

1378
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,359
the old book they're just public online

1379
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,200
i just literally take the book text put

1380
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,040
it on screen do the lecture i do in

1381
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,960
class i've made that for the new book i

1382
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,599
haven't put them online i might uh try

1383
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,960
to sell that somehow or something i'm

1384
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,640
not sure what i'm doing yet i like the

1385
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,160
promotional part because it engages with

1386
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,400
the audience so in the big picture this

1387
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,319
could be a whole other session but is

1388
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,920
there a future for technical books i

1389
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,599
think there's so much stuff now just for

1390
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,599
you on the web i do think that it's

1391
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
worth paying for trusted source

1392
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,359
information and people it's a lot of

1393
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,720
work um classroom textbooks i think are

1394
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,319
dead uh in my college uh we the they

1395
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,760
actually will get a grant i think this

1396
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,440
is a great thing they'll get a grant for

1397
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,119
a professor to make in what's called an

1398
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,760
oer open educational resource for things

1399
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,920
that are sort of common topics and then

1400
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,280
it's free to the students and the

1401
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,040
professor got paid to write it which is

1402
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,119
good so that's that's everything all in

1403
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,920
one so my book is still

1404
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,440
unfortunately for the industry but my

1405
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,520
book's still kind of a niche so it's not

1406
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,119
really subject to that yet but i think

1407
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,200
in general like in our school like

1408
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,520
general sound and things like that

1409
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,240
it's just a web page you go to now

1410
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,680
i might this whole thing i may be like

1411
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,200
surfing into the wave i'm not really

1412
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,000
sure

1413
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,079
i talked about that

1414
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,520
oh yeah i'm talking i'm gonna look and

1415
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,160
make an angry ebook and i think i'm just

1416
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
about out of time so

1417
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,200
questions for anybody

1418
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,279
no questions at all

1419
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,119
somebody's running up

1420
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,400
oh

1421
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,760
hey do you

1422
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,200
do you think print on demand is even

1423
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,280
worthwhile in this environment like is

1424
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
there is there any any real role for

1425
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,280
that i missed the first part sorry

1426
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,359
do you think that print on demand has

1427
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,000
any real role in the modern environment

1428
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,079
in the modern sorry well in the modern

1429
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,440
environment i mean you're talking about

1430
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
challenges of ebooks and and

1431
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,599
distribution methods and monetization

1432
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,359
and oer all this stuff then you've got

1433
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,359
places like lulu press amazon that'll

1434
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,040
bind it up for you right are people

1435
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,480
making money doing this does it work

1436
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,839
well that's what there's a role in the

1437
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,920
classroom yeah i'm not sure if you saw

1438
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,160
the other side i had but right now the

1439
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
my ebook sales are 10 of the of the

1440
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,440
overall sales right now so i'm still

1441
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,520
making money right now print on demand

1442
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
so again in my thing in a general

1443
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,480
purpose textbook i'm not sure um but i

1444
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
think uh but yeah i think absolutely uh

1445
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,640
there's there's a future for that thank

1446
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,440
you and we i was gonna we're giving away

1447
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,960
the copy we didn't want to like hand

1448
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,000
around the thing so we were going to

1449
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,280
give it to the first person who asked

1450
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
the question so greg if you want this

1451
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,920
copy i don't know

1452
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,599
okay and if you're not interested you

1453
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,280
can give it out to somebody else so i

1454
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,520
have a quick question so uh are any of

1455
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
the traditional publishers jumping on to

1456
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,839
print on demand for flexibility i

1457
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,760
haven't heard much about that

1458
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
uh that's a good question i i don't know

1459
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,280
because i i'd have been out of that

1460
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,400
world for a while but i will say in like

1461
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,240
2014 or whenever i did that first thing

1462
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
my publisher was like oh print on demand

1463
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,319
we're looking at that i think

1464
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,400
it's way cheaper than warehousing and

1465
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,680
all that kind of stuff again if you're

1466
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
going to sell a million copies of

1467
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,200
something like a political tele or

1468
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,599
whatever like that economics of that

1469
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,040
they'll just ship that to china and

1470
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
print you know a container load and like

1471
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,880
i have some photos and then sell to a

1472
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,319
weather calendar like they print those

1473
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,880
in china like now for the next year like

1474
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,319
those type of things the traditional

1475
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,079
printing model makes sense but for

1476
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,599
anything else like this it's sort of a

1477
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,920
niche or a trade book or technical book

1478
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,440
print on demand really does the only

1479
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,880
thing that makes sense and the print

1480
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,119
quality actually the old one and like

1481
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,520
old offset printing by the end you know

1482
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,960
second or third printing it started to

1483
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
look pretty raggedy but these things are

1484
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
basically just laser printed so every

1485
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,559
copy just looks brand new right from the

1486
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,880
pdf so

1487
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,240
great and i think

1488
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,720
probably out of time but that's it great

1489
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,359
well thanks very much

1490
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,040
let's go

1491
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,160
do

1492
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,040
do
