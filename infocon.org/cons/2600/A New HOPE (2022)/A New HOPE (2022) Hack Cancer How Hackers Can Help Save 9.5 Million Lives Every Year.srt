and now to our next talk

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
cancer is the leading cause of death

14
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,200
worldwide

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
in the u.s the statistics are that one

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
out of every two people will have cancer

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
at some point in their lives including

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
me i've i've had cancer in the past

19
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,720
the way things are going in research

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
we'll never find a cure for it

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,479
we need a new way of thinking about this

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,560
a new approach

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
our next speaker will explain what

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
cancer really is

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
why so many get it and why it's been so

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,960
difficult to treat

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
everyone please welcome our next speaker

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
cara moon

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
hi

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
i'm caramoon

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
welcome to my talk for hope 2022

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
it's called hack cancer

33
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,920
how hackers can help save 9.5 million

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,319
lives a year

35
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
i'm going to start by telling you a

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
story

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
it's my story

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
it's a nightmare really but there's

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
still a chance it could turn into a

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
fairy tale

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
more on that later

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,000
so in july

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,959
2016 so it's uh six years ago

44
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,200
i was suddenly diagnosed with terminal

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,879
cancer

46
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
i was

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
36 at the time

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
two young kids

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
my

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
son was

51
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,720
eight and my daughter

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
three

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
and

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,920
i

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
was not really given any time to live

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
realistic life expectancy was seven to

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
nine months that's with treatment

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,040
the cancer had or perhaps i have rather

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
is bowel cancer

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,879
colorectal cancer

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
one of the most common cancers and

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
the most common

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
um

64
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
cancer killers in

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
most countries

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
um i found that the cancer had spread to

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,959
the

68
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
abdominal membrane

69
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
and that's why the life expectancy was

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
really

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
seven to nine months realistically

72
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
i quickly found out that in the uk there

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,959
was no

74
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
serious treatment being offered

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
i could have some treatment to help

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
extend my life a bit

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,480
maybe reach that nine months

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,519
um

79
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,360
you know possibly a bit

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
a bit longer so it's 36

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
i might kind of do slightly better than

82
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,640
the average

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
but i found out there were very few

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
outliers um in in 2016 so typically

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
cancer patients with uh

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
colon cancer spread to the abdominal

87
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,120
membrane

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
got seven to nine months of uh

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
life after diagnosis with treatment

90
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
so things were looking pretty bleak

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
um fortunately a friend of mine

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
eben upton who uh you probably know of

93
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
um he's uh

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
my co-founder of

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
raspberry pi

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
he told me that there are still some

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,880
of the hiv patients alive from like the

98
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
first waves of hiv in the 1980s

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,440
he said what had happened was

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
some patients would get access to new

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,919
drugs through clinical trials and this

102
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,600
would give them a little bit longer to

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,880
live

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
and

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
then another trial would come up

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,440
and

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,479
they'd get

108
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,120
a bit more time to live and

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
it's like they were kind of riding a

110
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
wave of new

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
drugs and of course now

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
hiv is

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
manageable as a chronic disease

114
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
and in fact recently i think there's

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
been some curative treatments as well

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
so um

117
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
that was my intention

118
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
could i

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
get access to some new treatments and

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
live a bit longer

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
um and

122
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,840
make it through

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,240
this as you might have gathered um i

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
lived a lot longer than

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
seven to nine months because i'm here

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
now

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
six years later

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,919
um

129
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,120
so

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
yeah my story is basically i realized

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
there was no proper treatment in the uk

132
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
i had the option of

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
treatment in japan because i'd been

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
spending the

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
past um

136
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,240
like

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
what past few years before the diagnosis

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,919
i've been uh

139
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,919
dividing my time between the uk and

140
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
japan most of the time in japan

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
so i knew i could get treated in japan

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
and i'd heard the cancer treatment and

143
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
health care in general in japan was

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
considerably better

145
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
i had not really had any health care in

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
japan

147
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,560
but i had heard it was very very good

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
cutting edge treatments

149
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,960
really high standard of clinical

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
excellence everywhere in all parts of

151
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
the healthcare system

152
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,639
with the notable exception of mental

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
health but that's a

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
topic for another time

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,319
so i went to japan and started getting

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,880
treated i went through a lot of

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
treatment

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
had four years of surgeries chemotherapy

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
various chemotherapies molecular

160
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
targeted therapy

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
various radiation therapies

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,479
metabolic therapy

163
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
i had hypothermia therapy so

164
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
heating up the cancer tumors to damage

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
the cancer and make chemotherapy work

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,919
better so i basically had all the kinds

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
of

168
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
cancer treatments except for hormone

169
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
treatment that wasn't relevant in

170
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
my case

171
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
after four years of doing

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
seven kinds of treatment and doing many

173
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
of them repeatedly

174
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,319
i got to the stage called ned ned no

175
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
evidence of disease

176
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,360
and

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
my immunotherapist said

178
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
you've got to this stage

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
um but you should keep doing treatment

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
for another year

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,879
to make the chance the cancer um

182
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
returning much lower

183
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
so i did

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
another 12 months

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,599
of

186
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
low-dose chemotherapy so this is

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
chemotherapy where you have a low dose

188
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
but there are no breaks it's just

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,720
chemotherapy every day

190
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
the side effects are

191
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
better than regular chemotherapy

192
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
um

193
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,319
but it's still yeah kind of unpleasant

194
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
so

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
now um

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
i'm a real outlier

197
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,440
my kind of case is actually going to be

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
written

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
um as a paper by a japanese surgeon

200
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,719
and

201
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
kind of provides um

202
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,760
a case study and a pathway for patients

203
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
to

204
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,440
hopefully get curative cancer treatment

205
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
in my case

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,360
if i can stay with no evidence of

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
disease for another year

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
so i've had two years so far no evidence

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,760
of this disease and for the past year

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,320
i've had no cancer treatment at all

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
if i can stay for another year um

212
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
probably by

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
getting some more immunotherapy

214
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,880
when i get to the three year mark of no

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
evidence for the disease the chance of

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
the cancer occurring

217
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
drops off dramatically

218
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
for colon cancer and it's different for

219
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
different cancers

220
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
some cancers

221
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
yeah tend to

222
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
recur in the first couple of years colon

223
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,279
cancer first three years

224
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,040
but if i can make it to three years with

225
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
no evidence of disease then the chance

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
of the

227
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
cancer coming back

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
drops off dramatically and then this

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,000
story really could be a fairy tale not a

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
nightmare

231
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
so i'm gonna just give you some

232
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
background information of like

233
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
understanding cancer

234
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
um and then i'm going to talk about my

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
kind of blueprint for curing cancer

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,959
and

237
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
finally how you scale that cure so that

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
everyone everywhere can get really

239
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
effective cancer treatments

240
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
um there's obviously big financial

241
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
barriers in in some countries

242
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
so

243
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,399
um

244
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,399
background for cancer

245
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
so i'm going to explain what cancer is

246
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
why you should care why there seems to

247
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
be so much cancer around

248
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
and why is it so hard to treat and

249
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
particularly why does it seem impossible

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,959
to cure

251
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
so what is cancer

252
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
or cancer is a group of diseases

253
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,760
and they seem to be diseases at the cell

254
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
level so to do with the cells of the

255
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
body

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
this may not be correct it may be more

257
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
operating at higher level

258
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
there are various models for trying to

259
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
understand cancer but the cellular model

260
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
seems to be at least useful

261
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
and it's a set of diseases that are to

262
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,680
do with

263
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,200
cell division and cell death

264
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
so what happens when cells divide so

265
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
when you get a new tissue growing

266
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
and what happens when cells are meant to

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
die

268
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
and i think you can probably guess that

269
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,800
um

270
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
yeah cancers there are many issues with

271
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
the cell division

272
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
um you see this here list of rapidly

273
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,079
dividing cells

274
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,959
these tumors growing inside people

275
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
and cell death

276
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
you hear about

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
people talk about the cells ignoring the

278
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
signals to die

279
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
or hiding from the immune system so the

280
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
immune system doesn't kill them

281
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
um these kind of cells when when they

282
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
become cancerous they form these tumors

283
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
and they spread so there are

284
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
non-cancerous tumors

285
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
but

286
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
one of the key points is that a

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
non-cancerous tumor doesn't spread it

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
might

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
grow it might grow a lot might cause a

290
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
problem if it's pushing against

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
an organ or against some nerves or

292
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,320
whatever

293
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
but a non-cancerous tumor shouldn't

294
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,510
spread around your body um

295
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,639
[Music]

296
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,560
non-cancerous tumors can become

297
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
cancerous

298
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,639
so

299
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,639
that's why

300
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
yeah it's a good idea to get

301
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
checked out medically quite regularly

302
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,399
for that kind of thing

303
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
um

304
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,180
so

305
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,399
[Music]

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
it's kind of unique that cancer can

307
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
spread around the body it's very odd

308
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,600
because when

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
rogue cells are like

310
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,200
floating around in your blood or your

311
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
lymphatic system

312
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,519
they're recognized and they get

313
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,560
killed

314
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,600
um

315
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
if they make it to somewhere

316
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
they shouldn't be able to like stick on

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,880
to the side of an organ and start

318
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
multiplying and growing

319
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
but cancer cells do right can cancer

320
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
cells get past the many mechanisms that

321
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
your body has against cancer

322
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
so that's what cancer really is so it's

323
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
it's a group of diseases we usually talk

324
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
about cancer in terms of the organ it

325
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
started in like where's the primary

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
tumor

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
um

328
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
that

329
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,399
may be

330
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,480
um

331
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
less useful in the future

332
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
maybe it's more important to look at the

333
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,240
genetic mutation that caused the cancer

334
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
um we're not really sure yet so i i say

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
we um i know quite a bit about cancer

336
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,320
because i've got it um but yeah i'm not

337
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
a doctor

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
so um i'm not giving any medical advice

339
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
any point in this talk um and i never

340
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
would give any medical advice

341
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,639
because i'm not a doctor

342
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
okay so

343
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
yeah we talk about like where the

344
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
primary tumor was so in my case for

345
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,839
example

346
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
um primary tumor was in the sigmoid

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
colon which is the s-shaped bit of your

348
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,040
large intestine

349
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
and unfortunately when my cancer was

350
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
found it had already spread to

351
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
lymph nodes

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
liver

353
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,000
abdominal membrane later it spread to my

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
right lung as well um

355
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
so next why should you care

356
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,600
well the very short answer is that

357
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
either you're going to get cancer or

358
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
someone close to you will

359
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,720
now

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,959
that's the reality in 2022

361
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,160
i'm

362
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,839
you know working on changing that

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,480
reality for you and

364
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
other people in the world um more of

365
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,040
that later

366
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
but yeah

367
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,639
that's the reality basically is that

368
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
you're gonna get cancer or someone you

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
know

370
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
um has or will get cancer

371
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
and

372
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
obviously we need to change that

373
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,080
so

374
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,399
[Music]

375
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
what we need is effective cancer

376
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
treatments that don't destroy your body

377
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
and that are affordable for everyone

378
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,240
everywhere

379
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
so that's what i'm working on um

380
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
you can find out some of the stuff i'm

381
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,639
doing

382
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,839
from um

383
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,320
my website make cancer history dot jp

384
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
um that's jp for japan so make cancer

385
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
history dot jp if you want to find out

386
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,399
more about my personal story and

387
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,399
how i am alive

388
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,279
um

389
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,880
six years after

390
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,279
um a terminal diagnosis with

391
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
seven to nine months to live

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,360
um if you go to hack cancer.jp

393
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,079
so that's hack cancer.jp

394
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,000
that forwards to

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
like redirects to uh my gofundme page

396
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
and you can see the updates there i've

397
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
done

398
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
i don't know almost 100

399
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
videos about um

400
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,199
well over the past six years i've been

401
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
doing videos about the treatments i've

402
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,639
been having and the

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
results and that kind of thing so if you

404
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
go to hackcancer.jp

405
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,680
you can find out all about um

406
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,480
yeah my story if you go to make cancer

407
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
history dot jp

408
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
you'll see the work i'm doing here in

409
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
tokyo

410
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,440
to try and

411
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,240
make cancer history

412
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,959
so

413
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,199
next question is like why is cancer so

414
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
common

415
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,160
um

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
lots of high profile cancer cases you

417
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,079
you certainly know people with cancer

418
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,440
um you have to be a bit careful because

419
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
of course now

420
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,959
i see now but recently we have a lot of

421
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
social media so we hear about things

422
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
maybe um that we wouldn't have heard

423
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,199
about in the past

424
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,959
it does seem cancer's becoming more

425
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
common in young people

426
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,040
that could be due to environmental

427
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,399
factors

428
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,199
um

429
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,040
it could be lifestyle

430
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
issues

431
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
there are some odd things like the

432
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,439
number of non-smokers who get lung

433
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
cancer is going up so maybe that's um

434
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
due to pollution

435
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,039
maybe air pollution obviously um but it

436
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
could be other forms of pollution as

437
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,679
well because some pollutants are

438
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,720
co-carcinogens so they work with other

439
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
things to cause

440
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,599
cancer so they could be pollution in

441
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
water

442
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
that's combining with other things in

443
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
your body called causing lung cancer for

444
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
example

445
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,760
and of course i mean people are living a

446
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
lot longer

447
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,000
now which is a fantastic thing

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,039
um

449
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
but yeah in most countries there's

450
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,840
rising life expectancy

451
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,880
a lot of

452
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,039
diseases that used to kill people are

453
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
now um

454
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
yeah becoming controlled either as

455
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
chronic diseases or in a few cases even

456
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,720
cured

457
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,039
so maybe that's a reason why cancer

458
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,039
seems to be more common

459
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,840
um

460
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,720
we also have a lot more detection and

461
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
early detection

462
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
and screening you know that kind of

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
thing so i think um

464
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,360
people are

465
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
being picked up with screening is

466
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
finding the cancer or people are going

467
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,160
into the healthcare system with another

468
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
disease and the cancer is discovered in

469
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
my case my cancer was discovered just

470
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
because of some side effects

471
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
um to an antibiotic

472
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
so i

473
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
had a chest infection got a very

474
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
standard course of antibiotics broad

475
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,200
spectrum antibiotics got a bad reaction

476
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
doctor was a bit suspicious

477
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,240
she pushed me for some testing and um lo

478
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
and behold terminal cancer

479
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
not what i was expecting from a

480
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
cough and some medicine

481
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,799
so finally why is cancer so hard to

482
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
treat and why does it seem almost

483
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
impossible to cure

484
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
well

485
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
it seem it is hard to treat because it's

486
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
a group of diseases so

487
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
drugs for one type of cancer don't

488
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
necessarily

489
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,559
help with another type of cancer

490
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:10,900
um

491
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,960
[Music]

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
as cancer kind of grows and

493
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
even spreads in the body

494
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
it's almost becoming a different disease

495
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,039
so like metastatic cancer is a cancer

496
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,120
that's spread out of the body out of

497
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
where it started

498
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
um so that's like a generally stage

499
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
three or stage four cancer

500
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
is fundamentally different

501
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,760
as a disease to cancer that's

502
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,160
in one place

503
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,160
another reason i mean think about my

504
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
case is that there's often no symptoms

505
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
until the cancer spread so in my case

506
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,760
when i had these antibiotics

507
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
that caused some side effects because

508
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
there was a big tumor in my intestine um

509
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,000
and which caused a lot of pain when i i

510
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,880
took those antibiotics

511
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
so yeah some some cancer is almost only

512
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,400
found in late stage uh ovarian cancer

513
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,919
tends to be

514
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
no symptoms until it's um it's spread

515
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,559
which is um yeah very upsetting

516
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,440
um other cancers are in kind of places

517
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
where they can spread easily so breast

518
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
cancer tends to spread quite early i

519
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,799
think because

520
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,919
um

521
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,440
it can spread through the lymphatic

522
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,799
system

523
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
so it has access to all those lymph

524
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
nodes in the chest

525
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,400
gets into the muscle wall spreads

526
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,280
through the body gets into the bones

527
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,080
um

528
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
yeah so that's

529
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
one reason

530
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
um

531
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
another

532
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
perhaps obvious reason

533
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
is that the treatments are so brutal um

534
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
cancer treatment is is horrific

535
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,039
um

536
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,760
it's it's hard to describe just how

537
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
unpleasant it is radiation treatment

538
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,280
that

539
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
burns your skin

540
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,880
makes you go gray

541
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,039
it causes hair to fall out

542
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,880
maybe causes

543
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,640
other tumors in your body

544
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
chemotherapy

545
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,919
that attacks anywhere in your body where

546
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,799
um

547
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,799
cells are being replaced like lining of

548
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
the stomach

549
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,120
the intestine all that kind of you know

550
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,600
all those parts of your body

551
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
hair follicles

552
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
um

553
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,640
yeah they're really really really nasty

554
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
drugs the treatments are really nasty

555
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
cancer surgery so

556
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
surgeons do something called

557
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
cytoreductive surgery where they

558
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,240
basically cut out or burn out any

559
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,679
visible cancer

560
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,880
um

561
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
that they they they can safely remove

562
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,240
now

563
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
in my case the cancer would spread a lot

564
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,880
so

565
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,360
yeah six hours of surgery with the

566
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,679
surgeon hunting around

567
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
to see what he could um safely cut out

568
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
and then of course with

569
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,400
cancers like colon cancer

570
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,520
you

571
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,960
tend to have bits of your intestine

572
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
removed uh maybe your intestines can be

573
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
reconnected afterwards

574
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
very often they can't so you have a

575
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,960
colostomy bag where the

576
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
intestine comes out of the wall of your

577
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
stomach and

578
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
of the abdominal wall sorry and uh

579
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
attaches to a plastic bag to collect

580
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
waste that you have to empty many times

581
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,919
a day um i had that for

582
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
five years had a reversal surgery done a

583
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
year ago but i still have you know short

584
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
intestine big big bit of my intestine

585
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,720
removed that causes trouble every single

586
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
day of my life

587
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,480
from from now onwards

588
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
with breast cancer removing

589
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,559
um

590
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,280
either part of um part of the breast

591
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,639
maybe a lumpectomy

592
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,600
or

593
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
you know a whole um mastectomy again

594
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,799
with lung cancer

595
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
if it's a an isolated

596
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
tumor a surgeon can do a wedgery section

597
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
take out a little bit of lung

598
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,559
um

599
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,559
could have to remove a whole load of the

600
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,960
lung or entire lung

601
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,679
so um

602
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
patients gen

603
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
generally have to

604
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,559
stop

605
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,159
treatment because

606
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,159
well either they die um or because

607
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,159
the treatment is just so brutal the side

608
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,600
effects and the damage to the body is

609
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,200
just is just too tough

610
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,559
so

611
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,679
how about

612
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,039
actually

613
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
getting to a cure and sorting out

614
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
um some of this mess that is cancer

615
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,520
treatment

616
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
it's obviously well not obviously but

617
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
it's important to say that

618
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
some people are cured of cancer like

619
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,559
cancer is a curable disease

620
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,279
and it seems that most types of cancer

621
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,840
are curable and there are people who

622
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,240
have been cured

623
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
possibly in two years time i'll be

624
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
giving a talk at hope again and i'll be

625
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
saying

626
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,240
semi-confidently that i'm a terminal

627
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
patient who was cured

628
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
but the percentage of patients cured is

629
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
very very low and especially the

630
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
percentage of late stage patients cured

631
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,039
as almost zero

632
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,559
now i have to

633
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
state again i'm not a doctor

634
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
i'm not pretending to be one i'm a

635
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
patient who has gone through a lot of

636
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,279
treatment

637
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,760
i've studied cancer a lot i've talked to

638
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,159
lots of doctors i've talked to cancer

639
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,440
researchers

640
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
talk to hundreds of patients

641
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,679
and i

642
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,760
and quite a few japanese

643
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
cancer specialists have

644
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
observed something in japan over the

645
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
past few years

646
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,640
in my case over the past six years

647
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
um which is the time i have been very

648
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
unwillingly

649
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,400
involved in cancer

650
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,559
it basically observed

651
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,360
that there are four things that help

652
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,919
cancer patients

653
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,799
live

654
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,320
longer

655
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,400
and potentially even get cured

656
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
so the first thing is the condition of

657
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,520
the patient's immune system

658
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,760
right so

659
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,799
that's

660
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,400
really a key thing because

661
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
it's the immune system that cures the

662
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,559
cancer

663
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
i believe at this time

664
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,559
meaning that

665
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
when you have camp let's say you have

666
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
cancer surgery

667
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,880
and the cancer hasn't spread

668
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
a surgeon removes the tumor

669
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
and then

670
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
you have this microscopic disease left

671
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,799
behind

672
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
you may have cancer cells floating

673
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,200
around the body called circulating tumor

674
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
cells

675
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,799
and the immune system

676
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,559
hopefully can deal with those and the

677
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
cancer doesn't recur

678
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,000
the problem with this is that when you

679
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
have surgery there's a lot of immune

680
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,279
suppression

681
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
so it suppresses the immune system a lot

682
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
if you have radiotherapy suppresses the

683
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
immune system a lot

684
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,400
if you have chemotherapy it suppresses

685
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
the immune system a lot

686
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,159
now

687
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
if you have radiotherapy or chemotherapy

688
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,120
that kills from the cancer cells

689
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,640
the immune system can see this hopefully

690
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,799
and starts attacking cancer cells

691
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
so you can see there's kind of this um

692
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
like uh balance like seesaw kind of

693
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
balance between

694
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
the cancer treatment

695
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,080
killing cancer cells which

696
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,440
is obviously good and particularly

697
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
destroying tumors that

698
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
were damaging the patient

699
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,279
um but also causing immune suppression

700
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
so the condition of the immune system is

701
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,360
really important

702
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,120
and then access to the newest treatments

703
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,679
it just seems to be a recurring theme

704
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,840
when you look at

705
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,080
long-term cancer survivors they got the

706
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
newest treatments clinical trials

707
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,799
or just

708
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,720
just the latest treatments available or

709
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,600
using old treatments but in newer ways

710
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
right that's that william gibson quote

711
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
the future's already here it's just not

712
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,879
evenly distributed

713
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
the next thing that seems to be a key

714
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,279
factor is the total amount of treatment

715
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,520
so can the patient

716
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
deal with more and more treatment

717
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,559
especially

718
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
chemotherapy or this molecular targeted

719
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,919
therapy

720
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,760
can they have a lot of immunotherapy

721
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
so you can see already how these factors

722
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,440
are related because

723
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
um

724
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,799
more treatment if their treatments to

725
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
damage the immune system then

726
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
that's gonna

727
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
like tip the balance in the wrong

728
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
direction

729
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
and the fourth thing is the variety of

730
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,600
treatments so

731
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
[Music]

732
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,159
long-term survivors tend to have a wide

733
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
variety of treatments so there are eight

734
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
ways of treating cancer at the moment

735
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
i've had seven of them

736
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
um

737
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
and within those ways of treating cancer

738
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,720
so chemotherapy being one i've had

739
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,960
a whole cocktail of different

740
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
chemotherapies

741
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,679
and molecular

742
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
therapies

743
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
um i've had two types of radiation

744
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,480
therapy

745
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,919
um

746
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,120
so a lot of varieties of treatment

747
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
seems to be a key factor and that's

748
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,159
probably because

749
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:52,880
it

750
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,919
stops the cancer being able to evolve

751
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,720
like one of the reasons why

752
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
cancer survives

753
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
and patients don't is that the cancer

754
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,080
revolves very quickly

755
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,320
very simple darwinian evolution right

756
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,200
you have

757
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,440
a cancer treatment it kills

758
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,320
90 of the cancer cells in your body the

759
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,720
remaining 10 percent happen to be

760
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,880
resistant to that treatment and that

761
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,159
forms a new population of cancer cells

762
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,679
um

763
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,320
yeah so having a big variety of

764
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,440
treatments seems really important

765
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
so

766
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,000
those kind of four

767
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
factors i guess you could call them

768
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
they suggest to us what a cure

769
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,919
should look like right combination of

770
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,120
treatments

771
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
treatments that have

772
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,039
less impact on the patient particularly

773
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,960
on the immune system

774
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,720
um and treatments like

775
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,240
with a view to having more treatment in

776
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,559
the future kind of admitting that

777
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
the patient's going to

778
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,679
survive they're probably going to need a

779
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
whole series of treatments

780
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
so we should

781
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,799
carefully choose the treatments that are

782
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,880
going to keep the patient in a good

783
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
condition

784
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,159
so finally i mean how would you

785
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,080
scale this kind of thing and make it

786
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
into a proper

787
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,360
cure

788
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,679
um well

789
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
you know

790
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
some countries have almost no cancer

791
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,159
treatment

792
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,080
right so many countries in africa for

793
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,480
example there'll be no radiotherapy or

794
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
there'll be one radiotherapy machine for

795
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,840
a country of

796
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
20 million or whatever

797
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,240
a place like malawi

798
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,120
there's almost no cancer treatment there

799
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
some countries have really great cancer

800
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
treatment but it's very

801
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
uneven

802
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,919
in terms of access so the us would be a

803
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,760
good example there are some

804
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,279
fantastic

805
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,919
cancer treatments in the u.s

806
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,159
but not accessible for the

807
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
majority of americans

808
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,960
um cancer patients i know in the us who

809
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,279
are terminal

810
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,000
say that generally in the u.s you need

811
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
about a million dollars

812
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,320
as a terminal patient to kind of um like

813
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,080
live

814
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,480
as long as possible with your cancer

815
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
right so if you

816
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,320
wanted to

817
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,840
do the best

818
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,640
get the best treatments whatever um

819
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
it's going to cost you about a million

820
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,519
dollars um

821
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,360
yeah so it's very uneven treatment

822
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
in other countries the treatment is

823
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,919
uneven depending on cancer type and age

824
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,559
of patients so in the uk for example

825
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
really good surgical technique

826
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,039
um quite poor

827
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,919
in other areas of healthcare

828
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,600
related to cancer

829
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
so overall

830
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,399
um

831
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,159
quite poor cancer care um

832
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,240
i don't like saying that i'm

833
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,279
british

834
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,640
um but yeah i would not be

835
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,799
alive six years later if i had stayed in

836
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,840
the uk for treatment absolutely not

837
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,799
if i was an amazing case

838
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,840
maybe would have lasted um

839
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
a year year and a half

840
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
if i was one of those amazing outliers

841
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,799
in the uk

842
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
certainly wouldn't have been here six

843
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
years because

844
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
most of the treatments i've had are not

845
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
available in the uk

846
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,159
some that are just the the quality uh in

847
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,159
the uk is poor

848
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,840
um compared to what i've had in japan

849
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,679
so one thing that we really need to do

850
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
is is use refactoring

851
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,960
so we need to look at treatments that

852
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
we've already got

853
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,320
that treatments that

854
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
are

855
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,199
effective or

856
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,720
more effective than not um happy would

857
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,120
be be a more honest way of putting that

858
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,679
but refactor them so

859
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,480
without changing the treatment outcome

860
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
find a way to make the treatment more

861
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,960
accessible particularly

862
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,440
cheaper um so and that goes for other

863
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,640
medical technology so things like the ct

864
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,080
scanners and the pet scanners

865
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
mri scanners they are massive machines

866
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,039
they're very expensive

867
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,559
they're not

868
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
improving over the years they're still

869
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,760
massive and expensive

870
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,720
have very high power consumption

871
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,399
they're so heavy they

872
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,279
often the basements of hospitals so we

873
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,480
need to

874
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
refactor those re-engineer those

875
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,519
treatment machines radiotherapy machines

876
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,399
make

877
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,080
cheaper versions

878
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,279
um

879
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
you know looking at open source

880
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,120
solutions

881
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,080
um we need to

882
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,039
look at

883
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,440
cancer drugs where the patents have

884
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,799
expired

885
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
and then you can make a biosimilar drug

886
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,000
which is a slight alteration

887
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
but the drug functions in the same way

888
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,280
and that could be done by non-profit

889
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
organizations

890
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,639
um

891
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,560
and again we could we could sort of have

892
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,839
open open source

893
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,760
drugs um especially one thing we need to

894
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
do is share knowledge

895
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,199
among

896
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,119
cancer patients and doctors and

897
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,040
researchers so that's one of the big

898
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
areas i'm working on

899
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,239
so

900
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,599
yeah i educate cancer patients around

901
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,639
the world i run free online seminars

902
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,639
about treatments

903
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,520
i

904
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,040
have um

905
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,119
yeah provide information for doctors as

906
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,639
well and

907
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,879
yeah i'm working on getting doctors

908
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,119
patients and researchers together to

909
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
share the knowledge

910
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,719
obviously in the tech community we know

911
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,760
a lot about community and knowledge

912
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,599
sharing

913
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,280
but in the medical community um

914
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
well not even call it a community but

915
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
there's a lot less

916
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,880
skill

917
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,240
when it comes to sharing knowledge right

918
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,560
researchers are publishing

919
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,680
medical papers instead of

920
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,160
making wikis where people can

921
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,359
annotate and add comments and edit

922
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,680
things for example

923
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,760
um you know we need to get medical

924
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
professionals coming to hacker

925
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
conferences instead of just talking to

926
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
each other at medical conferences

927
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
um

928
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,640
so as i said before like if you go to um

929
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,880
make cancer history.jp

930
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
you can see some of the work i'm doing

931

966
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
question we also have some questions in

967
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,079
from the matrix chat

968
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
there's a couple questions again if you

969
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,079
don't want to answer these questions

970
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,000
because they do these two are a little

971
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
bit uh on the sensitive side

972
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
feel free to not answer them

973
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
the first one um from

974
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
from zapp was wondering how old you are

975
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,720
okay um so i am now 42

976
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,599
so when i was diagnosed i was

977
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,440
36

978
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,320
um yeah so 36 is kind of quite young to

979
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
be told you've got maybe seven to nine

980
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,400
months to live and uh yeah i'm surprised

981
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,079
and very happy to be

982
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,599
still alive now

983
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,839
six years later and we're very happy

984
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,160
that you're still alive as well and

985
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,839
congratulations on getting through so

986
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,760
far thank you

987
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,480
can you share um this question is from

988
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,320
the one wolf

989
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,920
could you share the order of magnitude

990
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,079
how much the cancer treatment has cost

991
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
over the years

992
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,520
um

993
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,839
okay so first of all i should say that

994
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,880
i'm

995
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,920
in japan where we have public health

996
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
insurance

997
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,920
so

998
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
a lot of my treatment is covered by

999
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,520
public health insurance

1000
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,960
uh in japan we contribute 30

1001
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,480
to the cost

1002
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,359
but that's capped as well like there's a

1003
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,200
monthly maximum

1004
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,320
um i was a freelance worker so my income

1005
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
dropped basically to zero when i got

1006
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,440
diagnosed and needed treatment

1007
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
so

1008
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,079
um

1009
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,560
yeah my monthly medical bill for

1010
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,280
standard treatment was maybe a couple of

1011
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,200
hundred dollars a month

1012
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
because it's limited by the japanese

1013
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,720
government

1014
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
all the

1015
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
kind of high-tech stuff like

1016
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
proton beam therapy and immunotherapy

1017
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
that's not covered by public health

1018
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
insurance in japan those are kind of

1019
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,119
cutting-edge treatments

1020
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,160
so i did crowdfunding for that

1021
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
um

1022
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,599
so i think it's probably somewhere

1023
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,839
around a hundred thousand dollars

1024
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,520
um

1025
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,079
maybe my life is worth that i don't know

1026
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,440
but uh it's a scary big number um but

1027
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,800
yeah something like that around a

1028
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,680
hundred thousand dollars

1029
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,839
i i think you kind of answered what i

1030
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,320
was about to ask but i was about to ask

1031
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,720
to what degree was your treatment of

1032
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
cancer in japan standard for japan and

1033
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,320
to what degree it was because you

1034
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
received some experimental treatment or

1035
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
you simply fought to

1036
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,160
get the best treatment possible yeah so

1037
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,960
my my treatment was very much a mixture

1038
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
of like standard treatment

1039
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,839
and

1040
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,440
yeah you could say experimental

1041
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,560
treatments

1042
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,440
especially combinations of treatments

1043
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,240
i was quite fortunate that my

1044
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,960
oncologists understood that the

1045
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,680
like the standard treatment protocol for

1046
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
stage four patients

1047
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,240
um doesn't have a happy ending right

1048
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,000
it's not um treatment of curative intent

1049
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
it's like palliative treatment kind of

1050
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
they're trying to keep you alive a bit

1051
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,319
and minimize your symptoms

1052
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,599
so

1053
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,839
i think yeah that my oncologists were

1054
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,680
quite open-minded

1055
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,599
about that

1056
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,560
and i found a fantastic immunotherapist

1057
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,400
who is considered the father of

1058
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
immunotherapy in japan

1059
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,520
so it'd be

1060
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,400
similar to dr rosenberg in the u.s who

1061
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,680
invented immunotherapy

1062
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
so yeah i had a mixture and i think

1063
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,920
having a mixture of treatments is really

1064
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,280
really important

1065
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,040
um i don't mean a mixture of treatments

1066
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
that work and don't work i mean a

1067
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,960
mixture of

1068
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,400
science-based reality-based treatments

1069
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,520
um maybe some that don't make a great

1070
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,079
deal of difference but that help other

1071
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,920
treatments work

1072
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,800
or just prevent the the cancer from

1073
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
becoming resistant to treatment which

1074
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,760
generally cancer does i mean it's

1075
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,359
very very basic evolution if you

1076
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,400
try and kill a population of cells and

1077
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
some survive

1078
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,000
they're going to go on and make um make

1079
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
more cells so that's what you're dealing

1080
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,280
with with late stage cancer

1081
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:40,760
user

1082
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,520
ml9991 2494 asks can you share about the

1083
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,599
non-medical side of things and how that

1084
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,560
has helped you with your cancer recovery

1085
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,040
such as a support network mental health

1086
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,520
caregivers etc

1087
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,440
sure um

1088
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,280
so the hacker community have been

1089
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,440
massively supportive

1090
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
that's helped a lot with mental health

1091
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,640
but also the

1092
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,119
what's called the financial toxicity so

1093
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,920
cancer is a very expensive disease to

1094
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,240
deal with not just the cost of medical

1095
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,200
treatment

1096
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,520
but things like

1097
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,240
transport to various hospitals if you're

1098
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
looking for the best possible treatment

1099
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,160
might be quite far away i spent um two

1100
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,760
months going every week like by bullet

1101
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,960
train to a hospital in north of japan

1102
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,880
for proton beam therapy

1103
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,160
um so that's a like two hour by a bullet

1104
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,240
train from tokyo

1105
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,720
um so those kind of costs are massive so

1106
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,520
the

1107
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
support of the haka community

1108
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,560
um

1109
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,640
has been really big like um robert

1110
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,319
firefly uh

1111
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,160
arranged an interview for me on off the

1112
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,040
hook

1113
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,280
emmanuel has been really supportive

1114
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,680
mitch altman has helped her fund raising

1115
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,599
a bicycle mark

1116
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
who does a citizen reporter podcast he's

1117
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,200
done a lot of interviews with me

1118
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
which has shared my story

1119
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,160
and mentally has yet made a big

1120
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,319
difference just having

1121
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,640
that outlet to kind of talk about what

1122
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,920
was going on

1123
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
or what is still going on

1124
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,200
um

1125
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,880
i also uh started a youtube channel not

1126
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,599
particularly a fan of google but um

1127
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,280
yeah doing those videos helped a lot

1128
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
with mental health

1129
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
um

1130
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,400
trying to stay in the best possible

1131
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
physical shape

1132
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,880
so that you can tolerate more treatment

1133
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,119
that's really hard to do when you're on

1134
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,200
heavy chemotherapy the side effects are

1135
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,400
brutal

1136
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,240
but um yeah trying to to stay fit has um

1137
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
yeah made a big difference i think

1138
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
any more questions

1139
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,319
uh you talked about working with the

1140
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,920
immune system

1141
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
thoughts on countering cancer's native

1142
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,720
immuno evasions

1143
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,839
so

1144
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,200
you know we've got

1145
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,880
a couple of things to deal with so we've

1146
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,800
got well

1147
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,000
we've got like the the cancer kind of

1148
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,040
suppresses the activity of the immune

1149
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,880
system so one way is it may be

1150
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,800
forcing down the number of white blood

1151
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,079
cells

1152
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,800
cancer can kind of suck in white blood

1153
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
cells into the tumors as well

1154
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,400
then also cancer cells are able to hide

1155
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
from the immune system by not presenting

1156
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,400
antigens

1157
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,440
um

1158
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,240
and

1159
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,359
also

1160
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
the kind of the consequences of the

1161
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
tumor micro environment mean that it's

1162
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,359
difficult for the immune system to

1163
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,560
attack

1164
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,119
the tumors so that's you know

1165
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,280
one approach is to have a variety of

1166
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,480
treatments so for example i had nk

1167
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,880
cell-based immunotherapy

1168
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,200
nk cells can attack

1169
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,599
bacteria they can detect viruses they

1170
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,720
can attack

1171
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,040
cancer cells presenting antigens so it's

1172
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,000
like labeled as bad cells but also

1173
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,760
cancer cells that are not

1174
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,319
presenting antigens we hear a lot in the

1175
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,440
media about t cell immunotherapy but t

1176
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,240
cells can only attack cells that are

1177
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,319
presenting antigens

1178
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,920
i took a

1179
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
diabetes drug called metaformin i don't

1180
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,640
have diabetes but it seems a side effect

1181
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,440
of the drug is it inhibits anaerobic

1182
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,800
respiration

1183
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,240
that means

1184
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
it stops or

1185
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,119
it reduces the

1186
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,040
cancer tumors

1187
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,359
anaerobic respiration

1188
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
the anaerobic respiration protects the

1189
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,400
tumor because uh lactic acid forms in

1190
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,160
the tumor micro environment

1191
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,040
and that

1192
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,400
destroys the

1193
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,880
immune cells um the white blood cells

1194
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,000
that are going in

1195
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,440
to attack it

1196
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
we also did hyperthermia therapy so

1197
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,359
that means heating up the tumors so they

1198
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,240
get

1199
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,119
um heat shock proteins forming on the

1200
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,599
surface of the cells your immune system

1201
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,119
can recognize that so there's a bunch of

1202
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,400
approaches

1203
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,160
to try and

1204
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,119
make the cancer more visible

1205
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,040
to the immune system i also had a

1206
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
dentritic cell therapy

1207
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,119
dendritic cells

1208
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,960
are the ones that look a bit like

1209
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,280
octopuses and they get bits of dead and

1210
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,480
dying

1211
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
bad cells

1212
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,200
and they take them to your lymph nodes

1213
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,119
and they present them to the t cells and

1214
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,640
nk cells so i had the dendritic

1215
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
therapy

1216
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,359
um

1217
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,839
and then the other big thing was um the

1218
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,680
autologous therapies of using my white

1219
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,200
blood cells

1220
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,440
so removing some of those growing them

1221
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,599
in the lab until they were maybe a

1222
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,920
billion times more and then

1223
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,480
having those like returned to me as a

1224
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,000
drip so doing that to massively increase

1225
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,480
the number of white blood cells

1226
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,640
in my body so yeah those are

1227
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,400
some of the approaches

1228
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,319
um but yeah

1229
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,400
it's it's the immune system that has the

1230
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,200
ability to cure cancer ultimately i

1231
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,400
think so we have to also choose

1232
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
therapies that are not going to trash

1233
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,240
the immune system

1234
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,680
radiation

1235
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,000
destroys white blood cells

1236
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,720
chemo destroys white blood cells so

1237
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,760
using those treatments very carefully

1238
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,359
um cancer surgery causes massive

1239
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,640
immuno

1240
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,920
suppression

1241
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,280
so just being very careful about

1242
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,400
choosing therapies and timing them

1243
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,880
so that the patient isn't um yeah going

1244
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,079
to be completely trashed

1245
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
great question

1246
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,079
uh hello uh first of all thanks for uh

1247
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,760
coming to take the time out to speak to

1248
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,920
us uh i had a question so when you

1249
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,240
started your journey about like

1250
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,280
you know when they told you your

1251
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,599
condition up and you know you went along

1252
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,119
and started learning and experiencing

1253
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,880
more of these treatments and started

1254
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,280
learning about particularly the

1255
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
uh the trade-offs in the quality of life

1256
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,920
like hey i have to take this medication

1257
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,480
it does x y and z for me but it also

1258
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
makes me feel like this and this

1259
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,440
uh in your times of deepest struggle

1260
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,400
when

1261
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,760
you know you're like oh wow these

1262
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,200
trade-offs are this is like really big

1263
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,960
this is my life like in your greatest

1264
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,559
times of struggle how have you gotten

1265
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,680
through

1266
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,599
uh and and you know carry it on and be

1267
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,200
like well no i'm gonna keep i'm gonna

1268
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,040
keep trying i'm gonna keep you know

1269
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
living my life

1270
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,640
yeah so that is yeah by far the hardest

1271
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,640
thing and it's

1272
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,240
it's very difficult just based on time

1273
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,599
right so

1274
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,440
when you have terminal cancer you're

1275
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,280
extremely busy

1276
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,440
because a you're trying to live your

1277
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
life as much as possible in my case

1278
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
particularly trying to spend as much

1279
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,839
time with my my kids and teaching them

1280
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,800
to pick locks and pack and all those

1281
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,839
important life skills but i'm also yeah

1282
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,839
rushing around looking for hospitals

1283
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,720
finding doctors that will

1284
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
speak to me about

1285
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,720
the the cutting edge treatments the

1286
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
experimental treatments

1287
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,050
um

1288
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,559
[Music]

1289
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
so i think yeah one thing was that when

1290
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,680
i got annoyed and angry which happened

1291
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,559
quite a lot trying to um redirect that

1292
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,480
into taking action

1293
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,359
so

1294
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,640
the the

1295
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,960
like there's this um this saying that

1296
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,200
motion beats meditation

1297
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,599
um and i i believe that very strongly

1298
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,400
that taking action is the key thing

1299
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,960
um in my case it was often making a

1300
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,680
crummy youtube video where i tried to

1301
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,559
talk through the um hell that i was in

1302
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,000
um

1303
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,319
so yeah kind of

1304
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,040
when when i was in my my darkest moments

1305
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,359
it was really thinking like what can i

1306
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,720
actually do

1307
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
is there a question i can ask someone

1308
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,760
that might

1309
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,440
makes it you know result in some useful

1310
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,839
information um is there a way i can do

1311
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,359
some crowdfunding

1312
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,000
to pay for some treatment so instead of

1313
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,119
kind of

1314
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,760
dwelling on things which is like

1315
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,280
something i would do by

1316
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,640
by my nature

1317
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,079
um

1318
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,000
trying really hard to turn that into

1319
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,119
action

1320
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,640
um another really big thing

1321
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,280
is is like being reflective and

1322
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,520
realizing that

1323
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,920
there's a whole load of bad stuff

1324
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,960
happening

1325
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,720
but the

1326
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,200
[Music]

1327
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,119
the worst thing is like the result of

1328
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,079
all that

1329
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,280
so what i mean by that for example is

1330
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,160
when we don't have much sleep

1331
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,640
um everything is screwed up

1332
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,839
right so often i was um

1333
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,240
yeah really at the point of giving up

1334
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,319
and i had to kind of remind myself that

1335
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,760
at least part of that was sleep

1336
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
deprivation because

1337
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,040
i'd spend nights vomiting on the chemo

1338
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,119
or you know after the surgery i was in

1339
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,800
pain a lot and

1340
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
i had a chemo drug

1341
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,000
that the um i was given like a steroid

1342
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,319
to stop the fatigue and the

1343
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,680
side effect of the steroid was

1344
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,359
uncontrollable sneezing so you might

1345
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,200
sneeze for like an hour

1346
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,000
um

1347
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,839
you know a few days after surgery so

1348
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,760
you've got you feel like the stitches

1349
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,119
are ripping open

1350
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,079
um i can smile about it now but it was

1351
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,920
yeah [ __ ] unpleasant

1352
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,240
um but kind of being reflective and

1353
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,640
realizing that yeah there's the sleep

1354
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,319
deprivation there's problems with not

1355
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,599
being able to eat

1356
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,440
so often um

1357
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,960
again with those steroids right you're

1358
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,920
given steroids to stop the fatigue

1359
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,839
they make you feel hungry

1360
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,240
the chemo makes all the food taste

1361
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,640
disgusting right it attacks the inside

1362
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,040
of your mouth it attacks the nerves and

1363
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,760
your tongue um had this

1364
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,079
side effect of first bite syndrome where

1365
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,680
bite food and it would send like

1366
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,839
lightning shocks into your brain

1367
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:58,640
um

1368
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,599
say a pretty pretty grim stuff but

1369
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,680
always like looking wet where i could

1370
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,680
take action whereas like meaningful

1371
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,400
action which maybe yeah emailing a

1372
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,800
doctor or researcher saying like this is

1373
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,880
my situation what can you recommend or

1374
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,400
that kind of thing

1375
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,440
um do we have time for another question

1376
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,680
is this next yeah

1377
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,240
are the body scans blood tests dna tests

1378
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
effective for

1379
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,640
let's call it like elective or

1380
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,839
non-medically required

1381
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,599
to pick up on potential issues

1382
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:35,850
um

1383
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,280
[Music]

1384
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,079
so there's a lot there

1385
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,079
the dna tests

1386
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,680
at the moment are pretty unreliable

1387
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,720
but maybe like so if it's over in terms

1388
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,319
of screening

1389
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,240
right so

1390
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,079
those kind of tests like um

1391
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,240
full genome testing

1392
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,880
um circulating tumor cells these kind of

1393
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,839
tests we call liquid biopsies

1394
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,680
um they are

1395
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,240
not particularly reliable because

1396
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,200
um

1397
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,960
like the companies make

1398
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,599
claims about accuracy we know it's not

1399
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,520
true because if you send the same

1400
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,280
samples to different companies you get

1401
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,119
different results so someone's not

1402
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,040
telling the whole truth

1403
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,760
where they are useful is like as a first

1404
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,200
step of staging so you might

1405
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,680
take a liquid biopsy and something is

1406
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,119
elevated or it suggests there's

1407
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,640
some tumor

1408
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,599
circulating tumor cells and then

1409
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,200
a next stage after that would be

1410
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,760
a traditional like biomarkers and maybe

1411
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,240
a ct scan or pet scan

1412
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,200
um

1413
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,040
if you are older

1414
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,599
then these things make far more sense

1415
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,599
like so if you're young i mean your

1416
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,040
chances of getting cancer when you're

1417
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,520
young are low possibly increasing

1418
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,319
recently but still low most cancers you

1419
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,559
know in in the over 60s

1420
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,079
um

1421
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,319
so those those kind of early screening

1422
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,400
tests are

1423
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,240
much more helpful for older people

1424
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,119
because

1425
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,800
there's if you get a positive result

1426
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,160
there's more chance that really is

1427
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,359
cancer

1428
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,319
um

1429
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,000
the scans

1430
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
uh like ct scans pet scans uh they

1431
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,720
obviously expose you to some radiation

1432
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,520
um

1433
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,680
again if you're older that's less of an

1434
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,960
issue

1435
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,160
if you're

1436
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,520
younger and

1437
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,040
tending to be involved in having

1438
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,119
children or whatever in the future then

1439
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,040
yeah that's of a concern so those um

1440
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,960
those screening tests

1441
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,839
are

1442
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,880
useful as part of a process they're not

1443
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,839
um

1444
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,359
reason to panic

1445
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,119
in themselves right if you do one of

1446
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,280
these um

1447
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,520
uh rapid genome sequencing and it says

1448
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,119
like you've got all these mutations

1449
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,400
you're probably gonna get cancer um

1450
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,720
that's not something to to be uh

1451
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,359
particularly concerned about um

1452
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,880
yeah because they're just not that

1453
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,319
accurate at the moment they may

1454
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,319
hopefully change it at some point in the

1455
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,640
future

1456
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,280
once again i want to say thank you

1457
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,000
for

1458
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,599
sharing this with us

1459
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,359
this has been

1460
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,200
one of the more uh

1461
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,520
amazing medical talks that we've had at

1462
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,720
this event

1463
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,240
and thank you for coming and joining us

1464
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,880
