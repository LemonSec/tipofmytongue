but before we do that i just want to do

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
remember everybody please stay hydrated

anyone overheating so

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
the next talk we're going to have is

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
hacking the anthropocene uh life

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,080
biological complexity and freedom uh by

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,070
abi hassan

32
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,040

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,239
overcast

34
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,599

um welcome

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,879
so uh i guess quick i'll just introduce

40
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
myself i'm abi hassan

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
i am uh

42
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
i guess not quite recovering i'm a

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
lawyer um

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
by trade um

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,879
and uh

46
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
at least a hobbyist uh

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,319
political philosopher and uh

48
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,200
organizer activist type um

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
and so i've spent a lot of time kind of

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
working with social movements and

51
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
working with um

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
working with like working with hacker

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,599
communities also and

54
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,480
but i also kind of you know isaac and i

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
actually went to college together and

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,159
studied computer science and so i've

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,680
always had uh

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
strong tilt towards computational way of

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,239
thinking and so

60
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
this is kind of a synthesis of of a lot

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
of a lot of things um but like primarily

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
focused on this problem of

63
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,799
uh the crisis that is our modern world

64
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,480
and so i'll let isaac introduce himself

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
my name is isaac overcast i'm a

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
biologist i'm a computational biologist

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,040
uh

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
you know specifically i focus on kind of

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
trying to understand how biodiversity

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
works from a

71
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
you know complexity science or complex

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
systems perspective

73
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,238
uh

74
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,959
but you know

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
so so so

76
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
my head is kind of in the more of the

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,720
biology

78
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
my head's more in the biology and and so

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
but abby's uh always kind of

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
drawing me back into applying the tools

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
that i use to study you know nature

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
biodiversity to think more about

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
uh how we can you know

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
solve social problems or you know

85
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,600
organizational problems or

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,199
political problems political problems

87
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
exactly

88
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
so

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
to start off kind of we're going to you

90
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,960
know

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
it's we're calling this hacking the

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
anthropocene so what do we mean by

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
hacking right um

94
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
i think there's two kind of

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
ideas of of hacking expressed here

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
there's uh

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,639
this kind of

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
this kind of old school uh if people are

99
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
familiar with the book by stephen levy

100
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,639
um

101
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
this old there's an old school kind of

102
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,000
like

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
coming out of the mit hacker scene the

104
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
origins of computing this

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,199
kind of

106
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,479
this this

107
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
kind of engineering driven but you know

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
just just uh

109
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
the old-school notion of hacking right

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
um

111
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
and i i'm going to be working with these

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
kind of two concepts from from this

113
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
levee book and from

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
mckinsey work

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,039
book um

116
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
a hacker manifesto that is is trying to

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
abstract and and think big about

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
hacking and kind of uh

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
you know this idea of bringing new

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
things into the world right kind of

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
abstracting away from a purely computer

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,199
compu computer geek world to like

123
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,840
the world right but but trying to also

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
keep some of that essence of pure pure

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
hacking um

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,039
and so

127
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
what do we mean by the anthropocene um

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
i think the anthropocene is a

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
controversial term

130
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,280
in some sectors i i've kind of used it

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
because i think it's the most

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
uh recognizable term

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
yeah it's the most accessible the most

134
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
recognizable i think all these other

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,759
terms

136
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,280
in parentheses

137
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
are useful it's kind of this idea of

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
um

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
you know it's it's

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
it's recognizing human

141
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
industrial

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
you know some might say capitalist

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,440
technological

144
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
you know this idea of plantation ocean

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
is kind of a

146
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
the idea of a commercial agricultural

147
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
uh post-colonial concept

148
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,120
another one that i like that i'll

149
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
probably use is this the end of the

150
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
world right this is coming from

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
uh timothy morton

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
and this you know and i think it's

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,800
useful because it it's

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
it it kind of captures

155
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,160
um

156
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
a lot of these ideas of system change

157
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
right the one world is ending or

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
multiple worlds ending

159
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
and the question of what is beginning um

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,720
and so

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
when we're thinking about

162
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
um

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
the crisis

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,800
uh

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
it's kind of like we're in we're in this

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
age of collapse right that

167
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
and whether something is a crisis

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
waiting for something else to be born or

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
a collapse into something

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
uh simpler or

171
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
less complex is kind of

172
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,280
an unknowable question right but the the

173
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
the perspective we're going to take is

174
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
kind of how can we look at it from a

175
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,840
computational perspective how can we

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
look at crisis and collapse

177
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
as uh computational thinkers as hackers

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,759
um

179
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
and so if we you know these kind of

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,919
that and and you know i think it's

181
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
important also to not think about it as

182
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
purely just the idea of

183
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,960
carbon or co2 emissions that it's also

184
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
what is being lost

185
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,759
um

186
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,400
can be looked at from a kind of

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
from a hacking perspective as well

188
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,960
and so i think it's also

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,160
just to kind of this is all just priming

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
um

191
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
kind of getting us thinking right um

192
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,320
this this this quote is kind of

193
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
looking at it from a post-colonial

194
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
perspective and

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
um

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,760
and that's another place where this idea

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
of the end of the world comes in right

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
because i think

199
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
the the societies that we in the kind of

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
rich

201
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
global north uh

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
western industrial world

203
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
is built on

204
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,279
the end of other worlds um

205
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,640
and

206
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
there's

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
um

208
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
even from a even from a computational

209
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
perspective or

210
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
we can think of of loss there and what

211
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
problems were solved that that we no

212
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,760
longer have access to right um

213
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,120
and so

214
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
you know

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
we're kind of looking at this idea of

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
collapse

217
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,080
the creation of complexity as as

218
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
essential to life and

219
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,560
the collapse or loss of complexity as a

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
form of death right

221
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
okay

222
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
um

223
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
so

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
you know

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
we have

226
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
if we're looking at these

227
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
these kind of charts where we see

228
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
one of these though we have over here

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,360
this kind of gdp growth or moore's law

230
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
right

231
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
that we might think of moore's law as

232
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
this kind of

233
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
increasing complexity and it is in a

234
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
sense of our societies

235
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
more transistors in in less space

236
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
but it's kind of being

237
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
juxtaposed here with

238
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
like those actual transistors are dug

239
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,920
out of the actual earth and are actually

240
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,040
destroying

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
an entire realm of actual

242
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
computation um an actual

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
um loss of

244
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
of possibility um and that's kind of

245
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,000
what that

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
top right chart is is kind of uh

247
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
it's a living planet index which is kind

248
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
of an index of many many species and and

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
you know these things are

250
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
at uh coming to a head

251
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,160
rapidly right um so

252
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,560
so the question is kind of

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
this is the big question that we're kind

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
of playing with here um

255
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,600
is the end of the world hackable

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
and um

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
the way we're going to look at it is

258
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
through looking at what living systems

259
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
are

260
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
and

261
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
what it means to be alive kind of and

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
what are some of the

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,120
conceptual

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
tools or what we'll call hacks that life

265
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,959
has created

266
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
and um

267
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,600
so

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
so the idea is like

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,839
uh you know we know that bio

270
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
biological life is capable of developing

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
complexity and solving problems

272
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,120
uh and so what we want to do is we want

273
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,079
to think about you know how

274
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
how does biological life solve problems

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,279
what are some of the hacks that that

276
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,600
life uses in order to kind of like

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
explore the space of possibility

278
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,120
and then we want to think about how do

279
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,839
we

280
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,360
how might we

281
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
apply what we could learn from biology

282
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,560
to

283
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
social systems or political systems or

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
organizations right

285
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
in order to kind of yeah like like abby

286
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
was saying in the beginning like

287
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
uh approaching hacking is developing new

288
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
things out of old right so we have these

289
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
ideas of

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,320
kind of

291
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
creating complexity and solving problems

292
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
that are as old you know more than three

293
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,920
billion years old what can we learn from

294
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
from

295
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
three billion years of evolution

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
so um

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,760
yeah so so so

298
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
we want to kind of start in in order to

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,399
kind of

300
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
uh

301
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
frame this idea of thinking about how we

302
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
might approach you know hacking the

303
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,560
anthropocene

304
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,079
uh we'll start out by thinking about

305
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
what is life and what is evolution like

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
how why is there something instead of

307
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,920
nothing how does evolution solve

308
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
problems how can we think about this

309
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
in a computational perspective

310
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,839
uh so so in terms of what is life we can

311
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,440
there there's kind of

312
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
two

313
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
uh

314
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,800
kind of lenses that we can use to think

315
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,920
about

316
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
uh what is life and one is a

317
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
kind of information theory perspective

318
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
where we can think of like the

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,560
complexity of molecules as

320
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,720
you know things that are very very

321
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
uh simple like

322
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
hydrogen atoms or water at you know

323
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,839
molecules of water where there's just an

324
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,399
h in the

325
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,320
h and two o's two h's and an o

326
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
uh i'm not i'm not a chemist i'm a

327
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
biologist

328
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,000
uh so we can think of it from an

329
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,959
information theory perspective

330
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
or we can also think of it from a

331
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
process-based perspective

332
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
so then once we have an idea of how we

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,079
can conceptualize of life then we'll

334
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,600
think about like

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
uh how life generates complexity how how

336
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
life solves problems what are some of

337
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
the tools that life uses to solve

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,399
problems

339
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,149
[Music]

340
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,249
[Music]

341
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
assembly theory

342
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720
uh yeah so so like i was just saying

343
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,839
from

344
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
how do we identify life right so one

345
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
strategy for identifying life has been

346
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
developed

347
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,880
uh by

348
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
several people over the past 10 or 15

349
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
years when they call it

350
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
uh assembly theory the the kind of root

351
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
of this idea is how do we how how might

352
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
we identify

353
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
uh extraterrestrial life out in the

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,279
universe right

355
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,600
because you know we can only really see

356
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,959
[Music]

357
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
uh signatures of chemical compositions

358
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
and very kind of faintly we can detect

359
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
uh the presence of planets by the kind

360
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
of

361
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
twinkling of light

362
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
uh you know gravitational lensing kind

363
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,360
of idea we can we can

364
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
see things very distantly we can detect

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
chemical signatures so if we can

366
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
understand what are the

367
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
kind of

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
chemical signatures of life then we

369
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
might be able to detect life in the

370
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
universe but we for the idea is

371
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,920
uh

372
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
how can we kind of quantify the kinds of

373
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
signatures of the chemical signatures of

374
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
life and so

375
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
their idea is that you can look at the

376
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,040
the

377
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
you can you can formalize how

378
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
complicated a particular molecule is by

379
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,959
kind of how many

380
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
steps that it would take to create

381
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
and then you can look in the universe at

382
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,240
everything that is kind of created by

383
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,959
passive physical processes

384
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
and everything that's created at least

385
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
here by life and there you know the idea

386
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
is there should be some threshold beyond

387
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,759
which

388
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,600
kind of background processes that are

389
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,199
happening in the universe

390
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
would not be able to generate you know

391
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,000
molecules of a complexity beyond this

392
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,199
and so then if you look through a

393
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,720
telescope out and you can detect

394
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
molecules of like sufficient complexity

395
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
then you could infer

396
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
that life is generating these processes

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,959
or you know generating these molecules

398
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
and then another kind of

399
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
way to understand what life is is the

400
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,639
idea of

401
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,880
autopoesis which is

402
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
um kind of the definition is up here but

403
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,519
you know autoplysis is is the idea of

404
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,360
what um

405
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
is a relational view of life right that

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,800
the a living system is a set of

407
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
relationships whose

408
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,920
function or who whose kind of

409
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,720
purpose is the repo reproduction of that

410
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,959
network of relationships right so

411
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
what you know what makes

412
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
a living creature like what makes isaac

413
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
isaac is not any particular you know

414
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
it's not any molecule

415
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,399
um it's not any particular you know it's

416
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
not any particular aspect of him it is

417
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
the network of relationships that has

418
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,199
reproduced him through time

419
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,320
um

420
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
and so those are kind of

421
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
two ways that we can think about what

422
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
life is that are maybe fruitful for

423
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,480
um

424
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
for

425
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
for our thinking so

426
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
okay so now so now we're going to think

427
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,519
about uh

428
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
problem solving how does you know how

429
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
does biology solve problems

430
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,199
how does how does life solve problems

431
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
uh and you can think of of

432
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
you know the process of solving problems

433
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
as the process of kind of accumulating

434
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,039
complexity

435
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
uh through time and so

436
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
life solved problem solves problems with

437
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
evolution with you know

438
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,520
evolution is descent with modification

439
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
and it solves problems by exploring

440
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,799
possibility space so we're going to go

441
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,679
through some

442
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
kind of examples of how you know uh

443
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
how this works in a biological system

444
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
and what we're thinking well i'm talking

445
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
specifically about biology

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,000
in the back of your mind i want to think

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,080
about i want i want you to be thinking

448
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
about okay how can i

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
kind of conceptual how can how can i

450
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
abstract this biological process

451
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
to a realm of social systems or

452
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
political systems or organizational

453
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
systems

454
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,559
uh

455
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
so so we can start by just thinking

456
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,559
about uh

457
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,840
trait space

458
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,050
so the the the

459
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,400
[Music]

460
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
the

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
the

462
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
domain of possible bill shapes of

463
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
darwin's finches for example and i'm

464
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
going to call this beak space because

465
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
you can imagine it's a two-dimensional

466
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
space

467
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,760
that's that circumscribes all of the

468
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
possible beaks that darwin's finches

469
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
might have from

470
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
less pointy to very pointy beaks and

471
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
from less smaller beak size to larger

472
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
beak size and you can see this is just

473
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,679
four examples of

474
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
these different darwin's finches that do

475
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
exist that occupy different kind of

476
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,679
areas of beak space and so the question

477
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,200
is

478
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
uh you know what why do the these

479
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
finches why why aren't they all kind of

480
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
the same they haven't all you know

481
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
they're is there shouldn't there be one

482
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
kind of like optimal beak shape and why

483
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
isn't there one optimal beak shape

484
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,520
or you know if there isn't one optimal

485
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,880
beak shape why are there different ones

486
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
and how do they become you know how do

487
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
how do

488
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,440
different

489
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
species kind of evolve to have different

490
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
beak shapes

491
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
and so this is right through a process

492
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
of of

493
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
evolution and how how i want to frame

494
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,080
evolution

495
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,280
in this particular context is as

496
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,640
uh

497
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
accumulation of complexity

498
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,799
or a computational process through time

499
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,280
uh whereby different lineages are

500
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,320
are solving pro solving problems

501
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
uh

502
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
you know and and kind of like

503
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
accumulating information

504
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,200
within the lineage of how the problem

505
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
was solved through time

506
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
and so we might start with this kind of

507
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,840
ancestral finch and then

508
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
uh in a given environment for example

509
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
let's say there's uh all of a sudden one

510
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,559
year there's tons of insects

511
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,600
uh

512
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:49,920
one

513
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,679
[Music]

514
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,080
offspring lineage might evolve uh kind

515
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,120
of more pointy beak for to to increase

516
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,080
its

517
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,960
insect feeding abilities

518
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
uh and so so the idea is that through

519
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
time as the environment changes as the

520
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
as the other

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
organisms in its environment that's conv

522
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,039
competing with change there's

523
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
there's pressures in beak space that

524
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
cause things to

525
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
kind of move you can think about you can

526
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
think about

527
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
uh evolution in trait space

528
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
as as this kind of like

529
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
walk through a two-dimensional let's if

530
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,679
we just keep the two-dimensional beak

531
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
space idea

532
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
uh for the moment

533
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,440
you can think of of evolution through

534
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
time is this kind of like walk through

535
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
beak space which is

536
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
uh

537
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
constrained by the environment and

538
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
available resources and competition with

539
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,559
other things in its environment

540
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,159
so you can think of i'm going to change

541
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,919
from talking about beak space now to

542
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,840
possibility space because then it's more

543
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
general right we can stop thinking about

544
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,159
you know birds and beaks and we can

545
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,400
start thinking about kind of like

546
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
any kind of possibilities for

547
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,240
animal morphology or behavior and it's

548
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
important just to know because beak

549
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,720
space

550
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
what the way the way we're

551
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,320
characterizing this is limited by what

552
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
we can actually measure and the

553
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,159
possibility spaces operating in the

554
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,280
world are obviously like

555
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
both the things we can measure but many

556
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,039
many things that we don't even know that

557
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,280
we can't measure at all right right

558
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
these are

559
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
this kind of these are

560
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,120
we're all operating in you know kind of

561
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
trillion dimensional hyperspace and like

562
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
a lot of

563
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,039
like what we can discern is the spaces

564
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,840
that we can measure right and so it's it

565
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
it's important to try to that's like the

566
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
the the part that's that's uh for me at

567
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
least it's like hard to break out of

568
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,520
that it's like it's not just the thing

569
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
the things that we can measure are there

570
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
and operating and we can make nice

571
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
charts of them and this is you know but

572
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,559
then

573
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,919
we also have to have the humility to

574
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,360
know that there's lots of things that we

575
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
can't measure right

576
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,840
right

577
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,960
right uh

578
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
yeah so you can think you can think of

579
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,919
each of these each of these colored

580
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
lines as a different lineage of

581
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,320
something a bird or

582
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
or an organization that you might be

583
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,240
involved in that starts in some real you

584
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
know area of possibility space and

585
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,200
because of

586
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
through time and because of

587
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,240
uh

588
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
you know pressure external and internal

589
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
pressures

590
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,960
the structure of the organization the

591
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
structure of the of the

592
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,360
species can you know it will it will

593
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
change through time it will kind of

594
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,159
wander in this possibility space

595
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
and so the you know as abi was saying

596
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,600
you know possibility space isn't two

597
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
dimensional it's highly highly highly

598
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
multi-dimensional

599
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
if we look at the kind of possibility

600
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
space of body plans for birds here

601
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
just kind of different characteristics

602
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,159
of body size and beak size and

603
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,720
kind of different proportions

604
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
we can look at we can take measurements

605
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,440
of all of the birds in the world and

606
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
plot them into this just

607
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,039
three-dimensional representation of

608
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,440
body-sized possibilities

609
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,840
uh and there's a couple you know

610
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
there's there's a couple of things that

611
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,760
you can notice from the how birds are

612
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
occupying possibility space here right

613
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,159
there's clustering so there's some

614
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
there's there's clumps there's kind of

615
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
clumping

616
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
here and here there's this very big big

617
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
central mass

618
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
i can't see a doodling because it's oh

619
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,039
yeah okay so there's there's clustering

620
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,240
and there's clumping there's a big

621
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
central mass

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,799
uh and and and the other important thing

623
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
to notice is that there's kind of like

624
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
vacancy in in in possibility space right

625
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
so there's vacancy

626
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
in the in in possible bird body

627
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,039
morphologies and so this could be for

628
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,360
two reasons it could be because

629
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
uh these are bad body forms for birds to

630
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,679
have

631
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,919
or it could be because no bird has tried

632
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
this yet right no bird has gotten there

633
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,760
and that's a question of contingencies

634
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
multi-dimensional contingencies that are

635
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,039
like almost unknowable right

636
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,039
right right

637
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,799
um

638
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
so now the critical thing to to

639
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,440
uh

640
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,760
the critical consideration for for

641
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
thinking about possibility space

642
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and the exploration of possibility space

643
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,279
is that

644
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,159
uh

645
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,840
it's you know it's it's it's

646
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,559
possible

647
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,559
for the exploration of possibility space

648
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,559
to kind of like expand the dimensions of

649
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,000
what's possible right if you're

650
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
exploring

651
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
what's possible then you might kind of

652
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,679
like open up a new domain of possibility

653
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,640
that didn't really previously exist

654
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
uh and so if you think about a good

655
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,320
example is with uh powered flight in

656
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,120
birds so you can think about the ins the

657
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,480
the ancestors of birds were were

658
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,440
dinosaurs uh their terrestrial

659
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
uh

660
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
vertebrates and you you can see

661
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,960
uh you can think of that you can think

662
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
of this kind of like pink

663
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
squiggle on the bottom here as like

664
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,919
the ancestor of the the terrestrial

665
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
ancestor of birds that that was

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
exploring

667
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,159
possibility space kind of in two

668
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,400
dimensions it's only limited to

669
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,520
what it can

670
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
you know the possibilities that it can

671
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,640
kind of

672
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
obtain

673
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
uh in its terrestrial habit

674
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
uh and then

675
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
uh

676
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
over the course of you know instant

677
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
effectively instantaneously in

678
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
evolutionary time

679
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
uh which is represented by this little

680
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
lightning bolt here where where the

681
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
ancestor of birds evolved powered flight

682
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
uh this actually opens up an entirely

683
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,279
new domain

684
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,039
in possibility space that was not

685
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,600
previously available to these organisms

686
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,360
right so so powered flight evolves and

687
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,679
then this kind of constellation of new

688
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
possibilities

689
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
uh has has kind of been unlocked right

690
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
by by by

691
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,320
this this this exploration and

692
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,879
possibility space

693
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
right so again it's free it's free it's

694
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,080
you you you develop a new kind of uh key

695
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
innovation and then there's free real

696
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
estate everywhere right

697
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
that's the

698
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,199
joke uh

699
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
okay so now we have this kind of notion

700
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
of possibility space and how descent

701
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,039
with modification can

702
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
explore and expand possibility space but

703
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,480
what are some of the tools that

704
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
evolution can use

705
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,760
in order to achieve this and so so again

706
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
like let's think about you know thinking

707
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
about

708
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,720
making abstractions and applying

709
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
abstractions to different you know

710
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,200
human systems

711
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
we're gonna just i'm gonna talk to talk

712
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,918
to you about uh

713
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,799
you know how

714
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,320
what we will say is that life is the

715
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,960
accumulation of usefully complex hacks

716
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,840
and so

717
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
what are some of these hacks that

718
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
biological life uses in order to solve

719
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,840
problems and explore possibility space

720
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,799
you know one one hack is uh

721
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,600
multicellularity right so if you're a

722
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,770
single cell organism

723
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,919
[Music]

724
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,039
uh

725
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,880
you know

726
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
the hack of getting together with other

727
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,960
single celled organisms and aggregating

728
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,799
and then specializing in

729
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,520
what you do that's that's that's

730
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,159
uh that's a hack that's a new a new

731
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,919
dimension of possibility opens up a new

732
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,760
dimension of possibility space by kind

733
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
of

734
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
uh obtaining multicellularity so we're

735
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,399
going to talk about modularity

736
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,960
extensibility and reuse as things that

737
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
you know as as

738
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,559
as hacks as biological hacks

739
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
so as an example of modularity an

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
example of modularity is the genetic

741
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,840
code which is the the

742
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,279
the the

743
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
um

744
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
the

745
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,840
code that translates your you know

746
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
genetic sequence of a's and g's and c's

747
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,440
and t's

748
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
into proteins

749
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
uh that

750
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
of a whole host of different kinds that

751
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
your body is you know every cell in your

752
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,480
body is composed of and so the genetic

753
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
code consists of

754
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
you know

755
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,080
in in

756
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,120
in the

757
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,080
genome each triplet of uh

758
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,840
base pairs encodes for one uh amino acid

759
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,660
uh and so but the point is the the

760
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,240
[Music]

761
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
the hack of the genetic code

762
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,799
opens up this massive

763
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,399
space for

764
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,760
modular recombination and right you know

765
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,039
it it it's

766
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,679
it's this this physical instantiate this

767
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,919
physical it allows for a form of memory

768
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
through time that opens up

769
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,158
you know just massive possibilities

770
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,039
right uh

771
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,399
so so

772
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,360
as a

773
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,000
another hacking biology is extensibility

774
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
so you can think of

775
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,799
genome evolution how how genomes

776
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,760
uh kind of evolve through time

777
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,480
you know genome genomes can

778
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,919
uh

779
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,640
plasticity represents a kind of mode of

780
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,039
extensibility where

781
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
you can see the the different colored

782
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,320
bars here represent kind of changes in

783
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
in genomic composition

784
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,120
through time in in mammalian groups

785
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,240
where

786
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,200
uh

787
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,760
you know some some some genes are lost

788
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
in humans that are occur in all other

789
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,919
mammals

790
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,720
and some some genes are primary specific

791
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
and some are carnivore specific for

792
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,520
example so

793
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
so genomic architecture of animals is

794
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
this kind of like

795
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
very

796
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
fluid and dynamic and constantly

797
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
changing uh

798
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
you know suite of tools for for

799
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
developing body plans and solving

800
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,360
problems

801
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,200
and the other kind of you know the other

802
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,279
hack that biology use biology is

803
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
constantly reusing

804
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,320
uh

805
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,559
everything and one

806
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,080
way that i think

807
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,480
biology reuses

808
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
information in a way that i think that a

809
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,840
lot of hackers can understand is in

810
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,399
whole genome duplications

811
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,600
so so through through out the radiation

812
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,080
of vertebrates there's been

813
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
several instances of whole genome

814
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
duplications

815
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,890
which result in for example

816
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,600
[Music]

817
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
you know the the kim you can think of a

818
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
whole genome duplication

819
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,200
as like a fork in github right so if you

820
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,919
have

821
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,559
if you have a project in github and you

822
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,200
have and it's doing something

823
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,799
you fork it

824
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
the project that was there before can

825
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
continue to carry the load that it was

826
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,279
carrying

827
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,000
but the new project which is the fork it

828
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
can change to do something

829
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,559
slightly different it can

830
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,360
fill a space that was not filled by the

831
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
original

832
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,720
uh project or it can

833
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
change to do something entirely

834
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,080
different uh so you so so the whole

835
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,240
genome duplications are a way of

836
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
kind of like

837
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,640
uh

838
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
providing just like a

839
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
a dump of new raw material

840
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,399
that an organism can use to con often

841
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,960
whole genome duplications are

842
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,799
uh

843
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,440
are followed kind of quickly by adaptive

844
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
radiations where you have this

845
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,760
massive amount of of new potential that

846
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
then gets exploited for into like huge

847
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,279
adaptive radiations

848
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,240
okay so the so those were some of the

849
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
ideas of how

850
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
how complexity is generated through

851
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
evolution and and

852
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,360
and so now we're going to kind of talk

853
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,399
about

854
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,840
some

855
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,960
that now is the downward slope of how

856
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
things are lost and and we're going to

857
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
talk about these three ideas of

858
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,960
generation extinction and collapse

859
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
from

860
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,279
again from from the computational

861
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,120
perspective and you know we're looking

862
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,000
here at this timeline and we're thinking

863
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,519
about um

864
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,640
about

865
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,519
you know this is kind of a timeline of

866
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
great extinctions um but then we're

867
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
gonna we're gonna also look at um

868
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
we're gonna look at like

869
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
strategies like

870
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,159
evolutionary strategies that lead to

871
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,600
information loss

872
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,440
and then think about how collapse and

873
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
uh

874
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,399
extinction

875
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,840
um

876
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
how how they function from informational

877
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
perspective so

878
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
so yeah so in but in in biology one kind

879
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,519
of way that you can kind of lose

880
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,519
information is by giving up

881
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,320
essentially giving up the

882
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,120
uh

883
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,440
ability to explore possibility space and

884
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,039
so in

885
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,679
in some organisms some

886
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,080
most organisms that we kind of commonly

887
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
think of reproduce sexually

888
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
where they you know there's com there's

889
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,360
two

890
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,159
genomes from two parents that fuse and

891
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,000
there's recombination so you get all of

892
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
this kind of like mixing of genetic

893
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
material and you're bringing together

894
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,640
two

895
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
lineages that have solved problems

896
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
differently through time and you're

897
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,720
taking the best of what each of these

898
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,159
lineages have done

899
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,320
over time over to over evolutionary time

900
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
right exactly

901
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
but another strategy some some lineages

902
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
they say ah forget this i'm just gonna

903
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
i'm gonna take all of them i'm gonna put

904
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
all of my eggs in in my current genetic

905
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,360
basket and i'm gonna reproduce asexually

906
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,679
and so this is called parthenogenesis

907
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,399
and so whereas kind of in the in the

908
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,919
organisms that uh replicate selflessly

909
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
in order to explore possibility space

910
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
parthenogenesis parthenogenetic species

911
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,279
replicate selfishly in order to maximize

912
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
the propagation propagation of their own

913
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,960
genetic material through time

914
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
essentially they're abandoning the

915
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,799
life-giving process of being able to

916
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
explore possibilities for the short-term

917
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
gain of being able to replicate

918
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,480
their own you know being able to

919
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,399
replicate their own

920
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,399
genetic material forward through time

921
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,639
most effectively

922
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,760
uh

923
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,120
another another uh lens on information

924
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,440
loss in biodiversity is extinction where

925
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
you know we're

926
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,519
i think unfortunately were kind of

927
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,560
attuned to you know hearing about

928
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,918
biodiversity loss and extinction and our

929
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,800
reaction is like you know

930
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,359
the we're never going to get the ivory

931
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
build woodpecker back

932
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,599
but

933
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,159
i think another

934
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,000
information theory and computational

935
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
perspective on

936
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,839
which is true and it's terrible

937
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,639
kind of computational perspective even

938
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,879
kind of exacerbates

939
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,760
uh

940
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
the the loss if you think about

941
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the the branch

942
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
that subtends the

943
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,399
given

944
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,560
extinct lineage if you think of all of

945
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,839
the time that that lineage existed as a

946
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,280
record of

947
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
the computation of all of the problems

948
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,960
that

949
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
evolution has solved along that branch

950
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
then when that branch goes extinct all

951
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
of that computation is gone forever

952
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
and then finally if we think more from

953
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,640
the perspective

954
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
rather than of individual lineages of

955
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,240
ecosystems

956
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,440
uh there's the idea of collapse and by

957
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
all in in ecosystem science we think

958
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
about tipping points whereby kind of

959
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
uh complexity

960
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,240
you know complexity of an ecosystem

961
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
kind of sustains itself and after a

962
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,079
certain threshold of complexity is lost

963
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839
then there's a there we call these

964
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,680
tipping points there's a collapse

965
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,359
of the ecosystem and it collapses to a

966
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,320
a kind of either to

967
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,119
uh

968
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,200
inevitable doom or it collapses to a

969
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,119
lower level of complexity and so this is

970
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,720
an example of

971
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,920
how uh in in reef ecosystems how fishing

972
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,520
and kind of like

973
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,160
uh abiotic conditions can can can

974
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,040
drive a reef ecosystem from a higher

975
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
state of complexity

976
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
to kind of

977
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,160
uh

978
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
um

979
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
lower and lower states of complexity

980
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,359
until eventually what's left is just a

981
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,280
barren kind of

982
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,359
rocky surface seafloor

983
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,520
and in a sense in evolutionary time that

984
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,079
is maybe a brand new possibility space

985
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,960
but as people we don't live in

986
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,040
evolutionary times yeah exactly um and

987
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
so this is where we're coming to kind of

988
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,680
collapse from a more human scale

989
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,000
these are these are charts from uh if

990
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
people are familiar with uh joseph

991
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,880
tainter's collapse of complex societies

992
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,000
um

993
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,320
you know and and his kind of main his

994
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,560
thesis is the idea of diminishing

995
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
returns on complexity that society's

996
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
increase in complexity in terms of

997
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,480
diversity of of occupation and

998
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,079
broadly in terms of any type of

999
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,599
diversity of what people are doing

1000
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,800
within a society but the energy returns

1001
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,720
on that you know that that that

1002
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
establishing and building that level of

1003
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,960
complexity in societies and this guy's a

1004
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
archaeologist so he's looking through

1005
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
the history of like civilizations right

1006
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,000
um

1007
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,119
uh and so

1008
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
that that it's increasing energy demands

1009
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
and depletion of resources leads to this

1010
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
you know the increase of complexity

1011
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,000
leads to like

1012
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
collapse which is he's defining as a

1013
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
lowering or a lessening of complexity

1014
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,960
within society

1015
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,359
and so

1016
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,680
here we have um

1017
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
so when we're thinking about these kinds

1018
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,640
of

1019
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,560
collapses and different types of

1020
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,400
collapses and how to characterize them

1021
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,240
we're looking at uh this is this is an

1022
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
example kind of endogenous versus

1023
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,640
exogenous um

1024
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,040
collapse right so we have this you know

1025
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,079
normally when we think of mass

1026
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,160
extinction that the asteroid is kind of

1027
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,680
the big one um

1028
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,560
the

1029
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,760
the kt

1030
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,320
boundary event um the death of the

1031
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,040
dinosaurs the the the and you know the

1032
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
opening up of

1033
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,520
like

1034
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,480
you know

1035
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,440
the mammal the mammalian era um

1036
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
and the you know that is

1037
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
you know a huge exploration of of a

1038
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
space but it's also like thinking about

1039
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,359
that as a bottleneck um event where

1040
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,320
um

1041
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,119
you know

1042
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,640
uh

1043
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
though like the

1044
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,079
the the complex dinosaur ecosystems are

1045
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,880
are destroyed through basically energy

1046
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,839
loss right that that the

1047
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,160
the climatological impact it's not the

1048
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,480
it's not the con it's not the asteroid

1049
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
itself that killed the dinosaurs it's

1050
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,720
the resulting climate and loss of energy

1051
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,640
that destroys the the the more fragile

1052
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,520
ecosystems that they were dependent upon

1053
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
and allows for

1054
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,079
um you know allows for the mammals to

1055
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,119
kind of right right there where you go

1056
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,640
over all that space it wasn't that it

1057
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,839
wasn't the asteroid that caused the

1058
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,839
cloud the extinction of the dinosaurs it

1059
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:56,880
was the fact that they were over

1060
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,640
invested in a stable environment yeah

1061
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,839
right and so

1062
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,839
and so but then thinking about that in

1063
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,640
contrast to a phase transition um this

1064
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
this other this other um

1065
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
over here is

1066
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,280
the idea of the great oxygen catastrophe

1067
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,440
um which is like

1068
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,880
i think from from this perspective is

1069
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
like the ur hack of

1070
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,240
planet earth right which is um like what

1071
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
2.5 billion years ago

1072
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,839
uh some some little molecule kind of

1073
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,520
developed the

1074
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
the the hack of photosynthesis right

1075
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,079
right of you know there's two sources of

1076
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,200
energy

1077
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
on planet earth right there's geothermal

1078
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,280
and there's the sun right and

1079
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
um basically

1080
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,000
the oxygen catastrophe is

1081
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,880
the

1082
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
the hack of figuring out how to stop

1083
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,040
using geothermal only and use the sun as

1084
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,079
a source of energy and it's like what

1085
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,760
it's like the biggest opening of

1086
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
possibility that life has developed on

1087
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,000
this planet right and so

1088
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,640
it you know it's it's it's the molecule

1089
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,760
in molecular form of chlorophyll right

1090
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
um

1091
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,400
but that's like as a extinction event

1092
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,640
that is like also can be characterized

1093
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
more as like a phase transition right

1094
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,040
because i mean though there still are

1095
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,839
anaerobic bacteria that live on like

1096
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
like uh

1097
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,599
sea thermal vents yeah like deep thermal

1098
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,760
vents like the vast majority of life

1099
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,800
obviously

1100
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,280
in some sense or another is is

1101
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
solar-powered right

1102
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
um

1103
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,880
so

1104
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,720
so that's how we're kind of going to

1105
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,319
move on to

1106
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,200
uh

1107
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,920
the second part um and

1108
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
what time we got what do we have 15

1109
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
minutes

1110
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
okay so i mean we have to be done yeah

1111
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,599
all right so

1112
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,599
um

1113
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,839
so

1114
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
now we're we're we're out of life i hope

1115
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
those ideas have percolated something

1116
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,839
and we're into this kind of more um

1117
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,720
more into the idea of hacking and and

1118
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,960
you know this is the think about the

1119
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,560
exclamation the title of this involves

1120
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,240
the word freedom i i want to put instead

1121
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,760
of exclamation point a question mark

1122
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
because you know um what is freedom how

1123
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
you know i think that here are three

1124
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,200
kind of concepts of freedom that

1125
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,960
come from hacking right

1126
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,920
um

1127
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,079
this idea of you know all information

1128
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,839
should be free access to computers is

1129
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,079
kind of the very like the provenance of

1130
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,280
like computers as a new thing and and

1131
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
kind of the source of a tech utopian

1132
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,880
vision for computing right um and then

1133
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,200
we can see the evolution from the 60s to

1134
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,480
the 70s

1135
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,599
the takeover of computing by you know by

1136
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,079
mega corporations and and the closing of

1137
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
of that space um and and then kind of

1138
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,400
you know the

1139
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,520
in the middle here we have the kind of

1140
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,839
four principles of of free software

1141
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,680
right where where this is kind of a

1142
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
response

1143
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,760
um

1144
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,960
and then i think we're kind of at a

1145
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
point now where we see like that like

1146
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,920
you know

1147
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,240
the narrowness of that has achieved like

1148
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,839
wonders but we're also at the point that

1149
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,079
like you know like one of the greatest

1150
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,079
you know one of the the most significant

1151
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,560
products of free software being linux is

1152
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
like you know basically a core tool of

1153
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,319
like the death machine at this point

1154
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,240
right like it's like so um

1155
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,839
it's not enough right like how do we

1156
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,240
expand how do we think how do we how do

1157
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,520
we uh reinterpret or think of of hacking

1158
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,880
in this broader way and i'm coming back

1159
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,440
to mackenzie work again um

1160
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,319
you know

1161
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,119
to discover that in essence this idea of

1162
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,480
discovery to freely invent but that it

1163
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
has you know the the traditional kind of

1164
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,240
well that we're still we were facing

1165
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,400
these kind of

1166
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
analogous to like some of these um

1167
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,560
systems of information loss we have

1168
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,400
these these systems

1169
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
social systems that are that are

1170
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,520
actually killing us right they're

1171
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,960
killing our ability to create but

1172
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,599
they're also actually killing all of us

1173
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,680
right so um

1174
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,160
this idea of property secrecy monopoly

1175
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,359
um

1176
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,560
and

1177
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,640
you know that that it is this kind that

1178
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,160
that

1179
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,480
that that you know that this relation of

1180
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,319
scarcity is being enforced upon us um

1181
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,480
and

1182
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,640
so you know it comes to this question of

1183
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,480
like how do we think of

1184
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
how do we create

1185
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,880
hacking as life um you know

1186
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,319
hopefully some of these ideas are

1187
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,000
percolating of creating new complexity

1188
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,880
the exploration of possibility space

1189
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,760
and

1190
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,520
you know i think there's lots like i

1191
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,359
think a lot of people are thinking about

1192
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,200
moving beyond information space right a

1193
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,920
lot of it is a lot of these battles um

1194
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,800
and the kind of the hacker wars or the

1195
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,200
hacker ethos is a is focused on

1196
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,040
information and there is like a

1197
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,079
refocusing on users and a refocusing on

1198
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,079
kind of organization

1199
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,880
um

1200
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
and and this this quote here is kind of

1201
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,200
telling us how do we you know

1202
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,960
in in the most abstract sense how do we

1203
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,319
how are we bringing new things into

1204
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,560
relation so that kind of thinking is

1205
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,680
is uh is happening and

1206
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,640
but

1207
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,240
you know and and so

1208
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,800
the last quote from from the workbook is

1209
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,640
kind of okay this

1210
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,880
hacking property itself

1211
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,880
re and and you know i don't want to get

1212
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,200
too too narrowly focused on on property

1213
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,520
itself but it's like

1214
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,760
hacking in the world engaging in the

1215
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,880
world and like you know at at the end of

1216
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,720
the day like this is the right idea

1217
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,640
and unfortunately like i'm not going to

1218
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
have any answers um

1219
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,200
great answers for you but this is

1220
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,160
you know

1221
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,839
the the point is what how do we bring

1222
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,560
our tools how do we bring our ideas how

1223
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,119
do we approach these problems because we

1224
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,000
don't have evolutionary time to do it

1225
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,640
but we have the ability you know we do

1226
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,160
have the ability to accelerate our

1227
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,760
hacking we can accelerate our

1228
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,520
exploration of possibility space if we

1229
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,920
are free ourselves up to do this yeah

1230
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,839
and so i'm offering a couple like the

1231
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,040
couple of tools that we're offering are

1232
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,800
kind of like

1233
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
and this is this is uh basically the

1234
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
last slide um and hopefully people have

1235
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,640
some ideas or questions you know because

1236
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,079
what we have is tools and what we have

1237
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,680
is ideas and what we have is is our

1238
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,359
ability to interact and so

1239
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,560
i'm kind of like

1240
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
trying to maybe decide toward gaia

1241
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,800
hacking or something like um you know

1242
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,280
and i think there's a lot of uh

1243
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,119
uh so

1244
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,960
i i think that if we look at this kind

1245
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,560
of three-part kind of thing a lot of

1246
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
what we've talked about in the hacker

1247
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,359
part is about information

1248
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,680
and so what i'm trying to what i'm

1249
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,960
trying to bring in

1250
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,319
is

1251
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,920
um

1252
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
how we think of freedom

1253
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,599
in in the other spaces right like if we

1254
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,079
could think of something like occupy as

1255
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,880
like a space hack right like that as as

1256
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,040
uh as a space hack that's opening up

1257
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,520
physical space and possibility space

1258
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,319
um

1259
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,640
or like if we think of

1260
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,680
time hack you know like that's kind of

1261
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
like labor organizing or taking you know

1262
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,040
like owning one's own time right or um

1263
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,880
you know

1264
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,839
and so so these aspects of time and and

1265
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,680
so when we're thinking about freedom and

1266
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
i think that the word freedom could

1267
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,720
easily be

1268
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,160
and i toyed with this i'm not you know

1269
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,839
it could easily be the word capacity or

1270
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
it could be the word power because they

1271
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,119
all kind of

1272
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,400
from this perspective i think of the

1273
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,280
same thing right and so this is kind of

1274
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,640
a tool that i'm using to like evaluate

1275
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,280
any particular like a project or an idea

1276
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,839
or whatever like that that uh

1277
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,640
that that that how these all three are

1278
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,359
related to create a robust or more

1279
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,040
robust concept i mean yeah i mean i

1280
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,640
think that yeah what what you know we're

1281
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,160
our convert in our conversation earlier

1282
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,520
i think it really made a lot of sense to

1283
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,720
me where

1284
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,599
avi was talking about like

1285
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,359
you know what is you know freedom is the

1286
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,280
ability to do something it's you know

1287
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,920
the ability to have agency to do

1288
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,400
something and that agency requires

1289
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,000
information and time and space and it's

1290
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,599
kind of like a hacker community we're

1291
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,839
really good about generating our own

1292
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,960
agency in the kind of information domain

1293
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,520
and we can you know we should

1294
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
be

1295
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,920
trying to develop our ability to

1296
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
you know form agency in the domains of

1297
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,160
time and space in order to kind of like

1298
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,720
accumulate more capacity

1299
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
and so hopefully we can use this time

1300
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,559
and space to

1301
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,880
um further this discussion if anybody

1302
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,160
has anything else i'd love to hear

1303
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
i think we have about five minutes left

1304
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,720
is that right

1305
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,240
seven we have about seven minutes yeah

1306
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,720
so yeah

1307
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,200
so i'm going to tell you what i

1308
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,520
abstracted from what you're saying and

1309
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,040
then i've got some questions that sort

1310
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,520
of build on that sure so what i took

1311
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,240
away is that you're in some way

1312
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,800
almost equating complexity and

1313
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,839
possibility so more complexity gives you

1314
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,079
more possibility less complexity gives

1315
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,240
you less possibility

1316
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,520
and that

1317
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,040
that that

1318
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,359
that sense of possibility and complexity

1319
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,920
also is a source of freedom

1320
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,400
um and that when you lose that you also

1321
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,760
lose the historical record of having

1322
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
solved problems or done

1323
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,480
ver

1324
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,800
developed that complexity in the past

1325
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,240
so if that's all true in what you said

1326
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,359
the questions that i have that sort of

1327
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,640
were spurred in my mind have to do with

1328
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,400
both the immune system

1329
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,359
and neural development and plasticity so

1330
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,960
the immune system is designed to meet

1331
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,559
new unexpected unforeseen previously

1332
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,240
unknown things

1333
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,960
and then it makes a shitload of

1334
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,000
different

1335
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,119
t cell receptors or antibodies some of

1336
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,280
which are really good and some of which

1337
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,000
are not so useful so there's this huge

1338
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,079
energetic investment in making a lot of

1339
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,599
different choices

1340
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,359
read complexity

1341
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,920
but because some of them are really not

1342
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,400
very effective you get rid of those ones

1343
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,119
and you end up pruning it down until you

1344
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,280
get a really good response

1345
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,599
and then you remember that good response

1346
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,160
so from an evolutionary standpoint the

1347
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,640
solution that evolution has come up with

1348
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,839
is spend a lot of energy figure out what

1349
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,520
works and then then condense

1350
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,359
which is kind of different perfect sense

1351
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,359
yeah which kind of is different than

1352
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,359
what you're talking about if you look at

1353
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,920
neural development and neural plasticity

1354
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,680
it's kind of the same thing as you make

1355
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,800
a whole lot of neuronal connections

1356
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,200
and a lot of them are not very useful

1357
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,440
and you prune those back so that the

1358
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,520
developing brain

1359
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,000
is making lots of connections and if you

1360
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,680
look how many connections there are in

1361
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,400
adolescence or in adulthood it's fewer

1362
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
but you maintain the ability

1363
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,960
to make some degree of new connections

1364
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,280
and so what i

1365
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,839
am inferring is that this is more of a

1366
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,640
cyclical process of sometimes you need

1367
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,599
to be expanded in a very high complexity

1368
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,800
state and sometimes you need to reduce

1369
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,880
down into what's useful so that you

1370
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,119
don't waste a lot of energy and then you

1371
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,920
can go into another sort of

1372
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,280
growth or increase phase

1373
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,119
how does that fit with the way you're

1374
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,880
thinking about it i mean i think what

1375
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,720
you know i think it's the kind of like

1376
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,480
next evolution of the thinking right

1377
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,839
like i don't disagree with anything that

1378
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,119
you just said i think that that's really

1379
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
wonderful i think it's like

1380
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,440
an expansion of the ideas that we had

1381
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,200
and i think that we didn't even get

1382
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,880
there because we

1383
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,119
uh i i definitely agree with you about

1384
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,800
the immune system and about neural

1385
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,559
generation those are great it's a great

1386
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,920
insight i think you've understood well

1387
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
what we what we're proposing

1388
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,319
i mean it sometimes worries me i mean i

1389
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,920
also like to think about complex

1390
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
adaptive systems i'm an immunologist so

1391
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
i think a lot about this kind of stuff

1392
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,280
but complex adaptive systems

1393
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,280
like everything have an end game it's

1394
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
maybe not a single end game but you know

1395
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,200
sort of a set of things that the

1396
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,960
organism has to survive because if the

1397
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,720
organism doesn't survive then it can't

1398
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
do anything else right so survival is

1399
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
important and then there's a question of

1400
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,800
what's the nature of that survival got

1401
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,680
to be

1402
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,880
and complexity per se

1403
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,359
is a tool i don't know that it's an end

1404
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,240
game

1405
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,040
and you know even if you look at sort of

1406
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,760
geological history or

1407
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,640
cosmology you do have this sort of

1408
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,160
cyclical

1409
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,319
there's a lot of different choices and

1410
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,880
then you lose a whole lot of species and

1411
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,559
then you get a whole lot of evolution

1412
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,480
among the remaining species because

1413
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
there's space that they can fill and

1414
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,720
their functions they have to accomplish

1415
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,040
and so it's sort of this give and take i

1416
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,319
think that's a great observation that

1417
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,920
makes perfect sense to me yeah totally

1418
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,839
100 percent okay then i really got what

1419
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,760
you yeah yeah no thank you very much

1420
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,079
yeah i can tell you're like

1421
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,280
understood very well what we were

1422
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,240
talking about thank you very much

1423
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,839
last question i think we have two

1424
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,119
minutes left thank you have you seen

1425
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,800
from that triangle that you put up are

1426
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,640
there examples of projects that you've

1427
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,920
seen that

1428
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,400
did a good job in more than one

1429
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,000
corner

1430
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,640
that's gonna put me on the spot

1431
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,680
i mean just

1432
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,079
you gave the example of occupy as a good

1433
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,400
hack of physical space

1434
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,880
and labor organizing as an example of

1435
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,200
time hacking

1436
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,400
have you seen

1437
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,040
anything that did did well at more than

1438
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,599
one corner not that things have to do

1439
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,920
well at more than one corner but

1440
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,200
well i mean

1441
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,800
that's that's a really good question i

1442
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,400
mean

1443
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,440
um

1444
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,559
you know i guess

1445
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,160
i i guess you know

1446
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,480
if i said

1447
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,720
a good question

1448
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,599
i mean i i guess it's i don't want to i

1449
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,480
the the point is maybe not to like

1450
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,520
say

1451
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,160
this is it it's not it's it's i don't

1452
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,720
want to like use it as a way to

1453
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,640
rate you know what i mean like it's it's

1454
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,880
much more of a way to like

1455
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,680
like

1456
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,640
like

1457
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
you know because i think it needs in an

1458
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,079
innovative model like it's about like

1459
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,599
like figuring out

1460
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,119
where you know so i i think that

1461
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,079
obviously

1462
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,480
you know lots of organizations do these

1463
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
things well

1464
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,200
at times right and like you know when

1465
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,599
they're growing or when when you know

1466
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,359
like the like the occupy example right

1467
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,119
like it it it did these it probably did

1468
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,119
all of these things well for him for a

1469
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,200
period right and then

1470
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,079
then

1471
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,040
um

1472
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,319
was

1473
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,880
bulldozed by the nypd or whatever right

1474
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,559
but um

1475
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,680
so

1476
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,520
you know i i guess

1477
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,920
i i don't have a good answer for that um

1478
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,720
but i think that it's more about

1479
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,359
practices in particular moments um you

1480
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,960
know that that i can think of you know

1481
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,880
so yeah i asked the question because

1482
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,400
i've in

1483
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,160
other realms of work that i do it's sort

1484
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,880
of

1485
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,440
you if you focus on just one you can

1486
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,160
sometimes constrain possibilities in

1487
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,319
another space in a way that

1488
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,720
is net harmful to the whole system yeah

1489
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,640
i mean i i guess it's interesting yeah i

1490
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,880
i think that the way to think of i get

1491
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,000
you know the more you're talking about

1492
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,599
it the way i was thinking about it would

1493
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,920
be during periods

1494
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,040
right

1495
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,760
like how do we integrate

1496
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,920
all three right in periods of

1497
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,599
mobilization or

1498
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,880
or um

1499
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,520
mass movement or or whatever right so so

1500
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,680
i think that we're out of time so

1501
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,240
thank you very much everybody

1502
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,799
thanks for your attention

[Music]

1505
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,960
you
