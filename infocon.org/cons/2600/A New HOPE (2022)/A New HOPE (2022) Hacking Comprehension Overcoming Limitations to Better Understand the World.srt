00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
ending up out front on the plaza so

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
we'll have a little bit of a street

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
party atmosphere to wrap up the uh

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159

the traffic forget about the traffic the

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,360
traffic gets better later at night right

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
so stick around for closing ceremonies

volunteer with packing up that usually

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
takes us until 11 or even a little bit

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
later at night we got to remove all the

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
rental equipment pack up a bunch of

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
trucks

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,759
take down our signs stuff like that

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
mostly unskilled labor we really

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
appreciate the help and then tomorrow

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
weekend doesn't mean there's not still

everyone i don't know if i should be

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
okay great well i hope you all are

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,239
energized i definitely have had a long

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,000
night so if i have to read my slides

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
it's just me trying to make sense um so

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
let's get started my name is jamie joyce

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
this is the second time i will be

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
speaking at hope um i am the executive

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,959
director of the society library and what

78
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,200
the society library is is a non-profit

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
collective intelligence organization and

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
what we work on is developing tools to

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
augment the way in which we perceive

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
social and political issues so that we

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
can make more informed inclusive and

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
less biased decisions

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
uh today

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
i'll be talking a little bit more about

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,280
what we do but the name of this talk is

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
hacking comprehension and what it is

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
about is essentially um

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
making sense of not only the big issues

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
like climate change and reproductive

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
rights and things like that but also

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
each other and that means overcoming

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
limitations of time attention perception

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
emotional empathy all the different

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
things that get in the way of us

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
understanding each other so i'm going to

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,799
be jumping into

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
an exercise to kind of show how we don't

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,200
see eye to eye but

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
um there are some other things going to

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
be talking about too so first not seeing

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,080
eye to eye

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
and then secondly i'm going to talk

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519
about the work that we do at the society

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
library and how we try to improve the

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
information environment by seeding it

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,280
with different visualizations of

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
knowledge and steel manned knowledge and

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,560
then

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,599
thirdly i'm going to inquire into what i

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
think is going to be the next evolution

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
of media and where we should start

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
orienting our design uh in order to

115
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
augment the way in which we see the

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
world and each other

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,279
i'm actually gonna scoot down so i have

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
my notes closer okay

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
so uh not seeing eye to eye are you all

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
ready for this i'm gonna ask you to

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
raise your hands it's gonna be great

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
oh you all did it already

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,120
there's no reason yet but just we're

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
about to get started okay now raise your

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
hand do you recognize this dress have

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
you seen this before

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
oh it's like everyone in the room

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
wonderful okay

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
uh this is the dress that broke the

130
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
internet if you remember people fought

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
about what color this dress is

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,759
so question who sees this dress as black

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
and blue

134
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,919
okay who sees this dress as gold and

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,199
white

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,320
a few

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,280
does anyone know why

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,800
go for it yeah

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
well basically basically our brains are

140
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,000
making an assumption but the reason why

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,120
is actually extremely interesting

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
because not only did this dress break

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
the internet but it also apparently

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
broke our uh theory of vision because

145
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
existing color theory could not explain

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
this phenomenon why do people

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
some people see this as black and blue

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,400
other people see it as gold and white uh

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
it turned out that pascal wallish uh

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
published a paper in the

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
journal of

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
vision and he offered a reason as to why

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
we see the dress differently and it's

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
not because of like rods or cones in our

155
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
eyes are necessarily because of the

156
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
contrast although the ambiguity of the

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
lighting of the dress definitely does

158
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,240
have an impact but it actually has to do

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
oops

160
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
it actually has to do with your prior

161
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,600
experiences so the people who are likely

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
to see this dress as black and blue are

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
the ones who spend a lot of time under

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
artificial light

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,240
when the people see it as gold and white

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
actually have an existing prior of

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
assuming that it is in natural light so

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
it's literally your prior past

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
experiences that is shaping the way that

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,319
your brain is hallucinating color for

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
you to experience so you know early

172
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
morning birds and night owls completely

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
see this dress different colors based on

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
prior experience not physicality now the

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
important thing of course about

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
scientific hypotheses is that you have

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
to put it to the test and see if it has

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
predictive power and so after pascal

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
wallish published this in the uh journal

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,479
of vision i just want to make sure i get

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
that correct um they went ahead and

182
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
proceeded with some other tests

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,039
including this one

184
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
this was a image that didn't just pop up

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
on the internet this is something that

186
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,639
they actually intentionally produced

187
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,120
they produced similar color conditions

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,280
so i'm going to ask uh who sees the

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
these crocs as like green and grayish

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,639
interesting okay who sees these crocs as

191
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
pink and white

192
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,639
this is so exciting okay amazing i've

193
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
never seen this result before okay

194
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,120
so

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
can anyone guess why you all are seeing

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,960
these crocs as different colors

197
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
bingo okay perfect so the existing prior

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
of the dress was your relationship to

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
natural versus artificial light that

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
existing prior caused your brain to fill

201
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
in the ambiguity of the image and

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
hallucinate either a black and blue

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
dress or a golden white dress you over

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
there got that totally correct for

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
people the the existing prior actually

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,879
is correlated with age so people who are

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,680
older will assume that those socks are

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
supposed to be white when people who are

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
a little bit younger don't necessarily

210
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
have that existing prior of socks being

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
white socks could be any color crocs

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
don't really have a default color and so

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
that's where they found the distribution

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
which is extremely interesting so what

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,800
they concluded is essentially our past

216
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,199
experiences can exist as priors in the

217
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
way in which we calculate probabilities

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,639
under

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
ambiguous conditions especially when it

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
comes to visualizing

221
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,479
has anyone seen this image before

222
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,360
okay

223
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
so what's really interesting about the

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
dress and the crocs and socks is that we

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,599
can be looking at the exact same image

226
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,960
human beings can be looking at the exact

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
same image and conclude that they're

228
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,799
seeing completely different things

229
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
we can hallucinate our differences but

230
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
we can also interestingly hallucinate

231
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,479
consensus

232
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
does everyone see these strawberries as

233
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,719
red

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
yes yeah depends on the monitor

235
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,519
hilarious okay this this one right here

236
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,920
that i'm pointing at do you see it as

237
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
strawberries as red

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
i see nods i see nods okay would you

239
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
believe that there's no red in that

240
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
image at all

241
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
okay some more nods great okay i plucked

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
these pixels out because i couldn't

243
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
believe it myself i mean to me those

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
strawberries definitely look red but

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
it's again just our brain filling in the

246
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
details assuming what should be there

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
and generally a lot of people tend to

248
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
see this as as red it's not as divided

249
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
as the crocs and socks nor the dress

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,279
um okay so

251
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
it gets worse though not only let me

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
just conclude um so it seems as though

253
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
one of the reasons why we don't see eye

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
to eye is because even when we look at

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
the exact same image we can disagree

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
because we are hallucinating different

257
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
versions of reality and sometimes when

258
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
we look at the same image we can all

259
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
agree on what we see but crazy enough

260
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,519
what we all are collectively seeing

261
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,480
is a a hallucinated fabrication and um

262
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
it gets crazier because we're all not

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
looking at the same information of

264
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
course when it comes to social and

265
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
political issues we're not all zoomed

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
into the same data the same graphs the

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
same knowledge certainly not and all of

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
the ways in which we're interpreting

269
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
that knowledge are of course informed by

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
different experiences of life itself

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
different priors traumas lessons learned

272
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,200
tribes and apparently sources of light

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
and the experience of life and therefore

274
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
perception of reality can also warp

275
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
moment to moment depending on whether we

276
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
are rested fed sober caffeinated or

277
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
stressed which i can definitely attest

278
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
to i crushed a low-carb monster energy

279
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,839
drink right before this talk just for

280
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
you so i can tell like my reality's

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
definitely warped a little bit

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
moving on um and even we're really

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,079
trying to be rational we're really

284
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,800
trying to like survey the data landscape

285
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
put it in order be logical really

286
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
inquire into understanding complex

287
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
social and political issues like climate

288
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,079
change and reproductive rights and all

289
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
these things our brains are primed to

290
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
make over 300 kinds of logical reasoning

291
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
errors and there's over 190 different

292
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
cognitive biases that we can be

293
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
manipulated by as well

294
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
plus another way in which we don't see

295
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,160
eye to eye is because each of us have

296
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
different tools that we use to augment

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
our perceptions of reality many of you

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
in this room have a much different

299
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,680
insight vision understanding of apps and

300
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
software and websites because you know

301
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
how to program you can see and

302
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
understand it in a different dimension

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
not everybody has that we also have

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
asymmetric access to tools and

305
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
understanding of things as small as like

306
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
the physics of particles or as large as

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
climate systems of earth if i take off

308
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
my glasses right now i believe i'm like

309
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
technically legally blind

310
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
um

311
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
and luckily i'm aware of my terrible

312
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
eyesight and i've gotten glasses and

313
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
sadly my prescription increases all the

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
time but many of us are not aware that

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
we have blind spots

316
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,079
and uh we simply can't see what we can't

317
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,760
see because we don't know what we don't

318
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
know

319
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
now i'm going to extrapolate a little

320
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
bit because this talk is about social

321
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,399
and political issues and i think that

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
the way in which technology has

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
amplified the amount of information that

324
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,440
we're interacting with

325
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
has

326
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
potentially caused democracies to

327
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,839
struggle a little bit and uh it's no

328
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
wonder people see the world differently

329
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
and many of us would probably agree that

330
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
some of those differences in general are

331
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
being agitated or exploited and people

332
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
are being weaponized and propagandized

333
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,200
in battles over social control and

334
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
political power

335
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
frankly

336
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,000
i can understand why authoritarians may

337
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
find it to be an efficient strategy to

338
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,839
just make up people's minds for them by

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
strictly controlling information access

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,959
confining their experiences

341
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,120
propagandizing people into tribes heard

342
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
mentality or coercing conformity and

343
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
therefore restricting belief formation

344
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
and incentivizing decision making as a

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
social control and political power

346
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,399
mechanism

347
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
uh as opposed to just trying to get

348
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
hundreds of millions of people to

349
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
find consensus together that seems like

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,079
a very difficult thing to do especially

351
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,279
when people don't necessarily have the

352
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
bandwidth of attention to all zoom into

353
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,120
the same sets of information that are

354
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
scattered across different forms of

355
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
content

356
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
however uh my hope is that

357
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
our work at the society library will

358
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,399
make a contribution towards improving

359
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,959
that and causing change long term in

360
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
part by building and hopefully

361
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,600
democratizing access to new tools that

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
can augment our perception of reality in

363
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,000
order to increase comprehension

364
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
comprehension of at least as a starting

365
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
point the varying points of view that

366
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,720
exist on issues that divide us which can

367
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,560
be rendered in new formats so we can

368
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
make more informed free inclusive and

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
less biased decisions about political

370
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,279
issues if we choose to if we want to

371
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,800
opt-in of course

372
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,639
with such tools i'm hoping that we can

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
more easily see our blind spots see each

374
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
other's views and come to understand why

375
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
some of us see black or gold pink or

376
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
green or red or blue

377
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
so now part two i would love to talk

378
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
about and show you some of the work of

379
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
the society library a little bit and

380
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,639
then i'll talk about some open inquiries

381
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
we have about enabling comprehension

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
essentially i am really curious about

383
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,639
how far we could go augmenting our

384
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
intelligence and comprehension with tech

385
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,079
yay so let's talk about work

386
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,120
um

387
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
again the society library is a

388
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
non-profit organization

389
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
and we are dedicated to improving

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,920
humanity's relationship to information

391
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
that's our big vision we do a bunch of

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
things from building political

393
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
decision-making models to advising on

394
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
the creation of legislation providing

395
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
educational curricula to various

396
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
universities and training professionals

397
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
in our research methods but today i want

398
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
to talk about how we build libraries of

399
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
knowledge that are structured as

400
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
societal scale debates

401
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
in building these libraries our goal is

402
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
not to coerce someone into seeing a

403
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
specific world view or to arrive at a

404
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
specific outcome

405
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
we are just looking to collect and

406
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,839
compress knowledge to make wickedly

407
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
complex debates comprehensible we want

408
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,199
everyone to be able to see from

409
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,639
different points of view make that

410
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,240
actually possible

411
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
and um for the first time for some

412
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,160
make uh increased comprehension

413
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
regarding the validity depth complexity

414
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
and variety of points of view on issue

415
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,160
accessible as well as enabling the

416
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
comprehension of new concepts and

417
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,360
nuanced context of relevant knowledge uh

418
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
we will see some of the things that

419
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
prevent comprehension

420
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
uh i would say that includes as i

421
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
mentioned before limits in time

422
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
attention empathy patience and access to

423
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
information so what we're specifically

424
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
doing in the tech i'm about to show you

425
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
is save users thousands of research

426
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
hours and finding new ways to compress

427
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,959
knowledge so that we can start seeing

428
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
eye to eye a little bit more

429
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,079
but then i'm going to talk about limits

430
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,279
to that approach because of course there

431
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,959
always are

432
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,839
okay oh one more thing before i show you

433
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
the library collection a little

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
background how we build these libraries

435
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,079
is we actually extract arguments claims

436
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
and evidence from books textbooks

437
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
scholarly works government documents

438
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
television podcasts websites

439
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
documentaries and social media

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,639
consolidate that content into a database

441
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,240
in which we structure the data itself as

442
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
a debate between all points of view last

443
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
time i spoke at hope i talked about our

444
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
climate change collection

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
but today i would like to show you a

446
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
state level issue having to do with

447
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
nuclear energy so let's dive in

448
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
it's going to auto play okay

449
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
so here's the visualization of a

450
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
database that we've built the database

451
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,199
shows the different points of view that

452
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,720
people take on the last remaining

453
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
nuclear power plant in california called

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
diablo canyon diablo canyon's two

455
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,040
nuclear reactors are set to be

456
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,839
decommissioned in 2024 and 2025. some

457
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
people believe that diablo canyon should

458
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,600
remain open and others believe it should

459
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,360
be closed at uh face value it may look

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
like it's a polarized issue there's only

461
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
two decisions open closed um however

462
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
what we've found using our methods and

463
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
extracting knowledge from over 4 000

464
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,519
references including government

465
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
documents and newspapers and blogs and

466
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
petitions and yada yada we found that

467
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
there's about nine positions that people

468
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
take on this issue and our work is to

469
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
map out the arguments claims and

470
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,959
evidence that support and refute those

471
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
nine positions um i'm not confident in

472
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,800
my ability to switch and give you a live

473
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
demo i don't like destroying

474
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,440
the the flow that we're in um but as you

475
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
can see what we've got here is uh

476
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
conditions in which it should be opened

477
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
or closed so oftentimes we're forced to

478
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,120
be binary it's either open it's closed

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
it's red it's blue it's yay or nay pro

480
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
and con but in actuality in reality when

481
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
we really dive into what people think

482
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
there are oftentimes only conditions in

483
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
which someone will agree to something so

484
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
for example there is a position that

485
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,919
people take where they want diablo

486
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
canyon the last remaining nuclear power

487
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
plant in california to remain open only

488
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,240
if the current utility that operates it

489
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
no longer operates it because they're

490
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
deeply concerned about safety oversight

491
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,559
all these different things

492
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,160
some people argue that it should remain

493
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
open only if it becomes a polygeneration

494
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
plan or only if it gets certain upgrades

495
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
and things like that so what's really

496
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
important i think and what has been

497
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,360
called mindset breaking by some people

498
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
who've interacted with our work is that

499
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
we start to break down the polarization

500
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,080
because things are oftentimes not binary

501
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
even with that dress it's not just

502
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,400
people see it as black and uh blue or

503
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
gold and white there's actually people

504
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
who see it in a lot of different colors

505
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
which is fascinating and it's similar

506
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,559
and we should keep that in mind with a

507
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,559
lot of our different social problems

508
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,080
moving on we're going to dive into

509
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
actually uh this is just to kind of show

510
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
like highest level view we're gonna dive

511
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
down one little logical pathway and i'm

512
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
gonna show you both we're gonna zoom out

513
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,720
and see the breadth of it as well as the

514
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
depth of this argumentation because

515
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
again the whole purpose of these tools

516
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
is to start augmenting the way we see

517
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
social problems if we're interacting

518
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,640
with not databases of 4 000 different

519
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
references but instead just a news

520
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
article here or there a podcast here or

521
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
there it's very limited information that

522
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
we're being given and so what we're the

523
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
work that we're trying to do is greatly

524
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
expand our comprehension of complexity

525
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
of these problems

526
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
uh so let's take a walk down just one

527
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
argument pathway in support of just one

528
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,879
position

529
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
there we go okay position one states

530
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
that diablo cannons should be

531
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
decommissioned as scheduled due to a

532
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
variety of different reasons uh in part

533
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
because there are so many or because

534
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
there's so many arguments to support and

535
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
refute this position we've clustered

536
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
arguments by category so we have

537
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,919
economic environmental safety energy

538
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,240
related ethical and political

539
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
these are extremely high level

540
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
categories and because there's so many

541
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,960
very high level arguments underneath

542
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
these we've clustered them under these

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
categories but these claims that you're

544
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
seeing here are also very high level

545
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
vague arguments this one for example

546
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
says market forces financial incentives

547
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
and policy decisions have made the

548
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
diablo canyon nuclear power plant

549
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
redundant non-competitive and

550
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
undesirable that's made of a number of

551
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
different claims here's one specifically

552
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
about it being non-competitive and

553
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
financially undesirable due to supply

554
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
and demand we can unpack that further we

555
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
get into economic assessments and

556
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
argumentation about the specific impact

557
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
of various different things happening in

558
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,280
the economy that would impact the

559
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
viability of the plant that can break

560
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
down further there are papers that

561
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
respond to that and as you can see

562
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,960
there's pro and con argumentation

563
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
arguing over the veracity and relevance

564
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,440
of this data and so the work that we do

565
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
is just in collecting all of this

566
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
different knowledge that's spread

567
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
through different forms of media through

568
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
time from different groups and

569
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
organizing that as a societal scale

570
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
communication for us this is just a

571
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,080
state level issue um here i am

572
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
on the video unpacking just the

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
different sections so like that was a

574
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
very high level vague

575
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
economic claim that we just traveled

576
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
down but here i'm unpacking all the

577
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
other categories so we have economic

578
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,280
we've got environmental we've got safety

579
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
we've got energy related we've got

580
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
ethical and educational and we've got

581
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
political and as soon as i'm done

582
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
unpacking these

583
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
i'll zoom up and down and you'll

584
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
actually see like even the most vague

585
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,640
high-level arguments that people may be

586
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,440
like flippantly making on podcasts

587
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
can be full of knowledge and

588
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
argumentation about whether or not it's

589
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
correct

590
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,679
and so the work that we've done in this

591
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,679
particular database and thank goodness

592
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,120
this isn't how we render it for the

593
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
public although you can actually access

594
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
this if you want i personally love the

595
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
debate map view um you can see it's just

596
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
unbelievable amounts of knowledge and so

597
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,799
the purpose of visualizing it this way

598
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
is to be able to really easily zoom out

599
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
and see the complexity and volume

600
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,039
and hopefully that's a little bit mind

601
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
mindset shifting but we also render in a

602
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
different way where we deeply compress

603
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
all of this knowledge to make it a

604
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
little bit more comprehensible and then

605
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
also focus in on how do we contextualize

606
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
these claims provide really important

607
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
indicators as to certain dimensions and

608
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,559
characteristics of that

609
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
so we will move on

610
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,440
and do that now

611
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
okay so um this is a more readable

612
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
narrative form this is uh what we call

613
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
society library papers it is all of the

614
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,360
knowledge of the database but compressed

615
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
into narrative form so instead of the

616
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
claims being in each little node

617
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
they could be partial clauses in

618
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,280
sentences that read literally as a

619
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
series of papers that you can unpack so

620
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,240
here's an example of that

621
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
so here that's the first position and

622
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,400
all the categories are actually in line

623
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
and you can unpack

624
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,039
instead of unpacking trees you can open

625
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,080
it up uh not only by unpacking it as

626
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
you'll see here these are supporting

627
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,159
argumentation but you can also open each

628
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,679
and every single one of these claims

629
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,480
into like a wikipedia style

630
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
page full of knowledge about where did

631
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,799
that claim come from and there's

632
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
information about like uh what type of

633
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
media sources it came from we do backups

634
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
in the internet archive so even if one

635
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
of the links disappears you can go and

636
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
find it there's some additional

637
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
references so essentially you can check

638
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
the integrity of our work you can find

639
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,440
the original context and quote in which

640
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,280
that claim was expressed and a bunch of

641
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,559
other information on each one of these

642
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
pages um

643
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,919
since i recorded this ahead of time

644
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,280
let's see oh yeah and then we also have

645
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
this feature where you can opt into

646
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
different expressions so you can opt

647
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
into technical or simple versions of

648
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
each one of these paragraphs we still

649
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,159
have a little bit of work to do fleshing

650
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,000
those out but essentially like that's

651
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
another one of our features of enabling

652
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
comprehension which is what this is

653
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
about is like if you're reading some

654
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
technical claim about an economic

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
assessment

656
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,640
and it's using terminology with which

657
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
you're not familiar you can just flip to

658
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
the left and read a fourth grade reading

659
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
level like version of that or perhaps

660
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,159
you're an economist and you really want

661
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,600
to know that they're using a specific

662
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
model like the implant model you can

663
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
flip to the right and you can actually

664
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
see a much more detailed explanation of

665
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
that particular economic argumentation

666
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
and so this is just an example of how

667
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,799
like we're trying to pull in and

668
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
compress this knowledge uh to make uh

669
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,520
comprehension of these really complex

670
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
things actually possible in a format

671
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,559
that's really familiar

672
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
um but of course i mean haven't we moved

673
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,320
on from text on paper we're like in the

674
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,640
land of tick tocks and tweets and

675
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
multimedia stuff and the metaverse is

676
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
coming so even though the society

677
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
library is starting by just kind of

678
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
reinventing the piece of paper what's

679
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,919
amazing about the databases that we're

680
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,919
creating is i have no doubt that one we

681
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,159
will be able to render it in much more

682
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,080
vivid interactive and experiential

683
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,799
knowledge but i think we'll also have to

684
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,840
um

685
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
and

686
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
i mean yes more more and more diverse

687
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
ways to visualize knowledge are possible

688
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,279
so i'm not concerned about that i think

689
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,360
it's very easy for us to just give away

690
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
the data and designers can render it

691
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
however they wish and i hope there's

692
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
lots of experimentation and iteration to

693
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
make sure that uh it's meeting those

694
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
goals of it being comprehensible but

695
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
what i am concerned about which is a

696
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
part of what this talk is about is the

697
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,039
ethics of inducing comprehension

698
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,840
uh how do we decide what information

699
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
should be expressed to a level of

700
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,039
vividness you know what if it's too

701
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,120
impactful what if it's too persuasive

702
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
there's so many pitfalls

703
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
uh i imagine many people here who work

704
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
in security are aware of the nefarious

705
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
ways to force someone to comprehend

706
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
something through manipulation ways to

707
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
coerce someone to change their mind or

708
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
come to a conclusion without necessarily

709
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
having their consent this is very

710
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
popular in politics there are people who

711
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
hit the streets who have mastered

712
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
techniques to make people doubt their

713
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
own beliefs and you know i'm not saying

714
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
that's wrong or change their mind or

715
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
things like that politics is a is a

716
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
power game and so the society library's

717
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,919
not interested in that we're interested

718
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,520
in serving information needs without

719
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,600
being coercive so part of this talk is

720
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,360
me bringing to you all this ethical

721
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
conundrum of how do we figure out the

722
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,960
right way of visualizing this knowledge

723
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
without accidentally prioritizing

724
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,919
something and being persuasive we

725
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,360
thought a lot about it there's policies

726
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,559
on our website they're rendered as

727
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
google docs please give us feedback but

728
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
uh we're gonna talk about something in

729
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
particular um some of the tactics before

730
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,320
i move on though include like compelling

731
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,159
disinformation agenda setting

732
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,760
manipulative language appeals to

733
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,400
personality and psychographic makeup

734
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
outright repetition negging bots to

735
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
drive perception of consensus by playing

736
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
on tribal or in-group desirability deep

737
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
fakes and then like have any of you seen

738
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,240
that magic trick where

739
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
a magician will come up to you and then

740
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,960
they'll

741
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,559
engage in conversation but what they're

742
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
really doing is seeding everything that

743
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,559
they're saying with movie titles and

744
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,320
famous movie quotes where they're

745
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
actually like building a semantic web in

746
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,559
your brain so that you're thinking of

747
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,320
the lead actor of all of those movies

748
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
without them ever explicitly stating it

749
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,679
and then they ask you like to think of

750
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,120
an actor and of course you think of that

751
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
person because your brain that's how

752
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
your brain generates information and

753
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,039
they pretend to read your mind and it's

754
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,320
like

755
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,799
yeah that's manipulation too um and

756
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,559
obviously the easiest way to go about

757
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,080
avoiding these pitfalls in the work that

758
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
we do is just like not executing any of

759
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,200
these strategies intentionally but uh

760
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,960
they're also tough calls that we have to

761
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
make like who decides what language is a

762
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,799
dog whistle or not how do you go about

763
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
contextualizing content so that is

764
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
represented in a deliberation but not

765
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,039
given extreme undue weight how do you

766
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
give people enough information to induce

767
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
comprehension without coercing people to

768
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
a conclusion there's an argument to be

769
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,200
made that technology is not neutral and

770
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
that means it's important to be clear

771
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
about the intentions of the tools that

772
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,279
we make

773
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
at the society library our intentions

774
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,880
for producing these libraries are to

775
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
enable comprehension and appreciation of

776
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
the legitimate nuance and complexity of

777
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
our social and political issues we want

778
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,679
our tools to give people a new site to

779
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
overcome their blind spots that are

780
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
inherent simply because there's too much

781
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
information spread all over the web in

782
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,080
the world no one has the time to like

783
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,679
map all the knowledge that we have we've

784
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,400
saved you 6 000 hours of research just

785
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
by creating that database it certainly

786
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
won't take you that long to read it all

787
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,080
and

788
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
in giving people this new site it's both

789
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,159
the google earth and street view of the

790
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,120
issue

791
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
and we're hoping that what this does is

792
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,440
inspire increased intellectual humility

793
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
depolarize and de-radicalize attitudes

794
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
increase curiosity increase resilience

795
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
to disinforming content and we also hope

796
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
our products and services will increase

797
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
subject matter knowledge these are the

798
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,360
things that we're aiming for and of

799
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
course can test for but

800
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,760
this is where the talk turns from a kind

801
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,200
of like show and tell about what we're

802
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
doing

803
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
um and more of an open inquiry beyond

804
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
comprehension my question is can we

805
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,279
induce wisdom

806
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,840
i imagine many of you in this room have

807
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
read sci-fi or fictional stories in

808
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,360
which wise sages are depicted um so does

809
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,799
anyone want to tell me what are some

810
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,279
characteristics of like the wise oracle

811
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,039
the y sage the wise guide

812
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
yes

813
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,600
experience okay

814
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
fantastic so understanding all the

815
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,000
different points of view at the table

816
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,520
and the arguments that support them as

817
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,600
to why yep okay

818
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
not having a dog in the fight so an

819
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,439
objectivity interesting yes

820
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,960
no interest in fighting very interesting

821
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,840
anyone else yes

822
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,640
good question does anyone not have a dog

823
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
in the fight

824
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,399
fair

825
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
well everyone

826
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
great answers i'm going to add a few

827
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
myself just to weave it into the talk

828
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,880
i'm going to say they can perceive of

829
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,559
multiple points of view that's kind of

830
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,679
what this gentleman over here was

831
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,960
talking about

832
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,279
understanding the big picture

833
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,840
are able to make accurate predictions

834
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,440
and then i also want to add and i think

835
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
this is actually very important

836
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
empathize and comprehend emotions values

837
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,919
and culture

838
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,320
so i actually think that feelings are a

839
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
very like important distinguishing

840
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
feature to wisdom i think a wise one for

841
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
example may understand the frustration

842
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,840
of a young padawan predict the pettiness

843
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,919
of an enemy or empathize with the

844
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
devastation of the loss of another

845
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,080
and i am wondering if inducing wisdom

846
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
must include inducing a comprehension of

847
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
feeling and that's where we get to that

848
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
kind of like tricky part because

849
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,679
removing kind of feelings is a way of

850
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,480
removing bias to knowledge and yet if

851
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
comprehension of feeling is important to

852
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,120
that greater understanding that wisdom

853
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,799
how do we go about doing that ethically

854
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,200
and carefully

855
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,360
especially when sometimes the feelings

856
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,720
that are necessary in order to

857
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
understand a situation can be like

858
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,799
really harmful and traumatizing or

859
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,159
actually just like impossible to

860
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,679
understand

861
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
so perhaps to a certain extent fiction

862
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,080
can actually be a safe wisdom-inducing

863
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
psychotechnology by reading or watching

864
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,559
a story we can gain understanding

865
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
compassion empathy and insight and it

866
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
may improve our judgment i can at least

867
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
go far as to say that uh media can be a

868
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
feeling inducing thing we can even be

869
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,960
forced to feel things uh

870
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
based on completely imaginary things i i

871
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,559
simply like cannot not cry when i re

872
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,240
like watch one of those wholesome pixar

873
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
movies does anyone ball like a baby at

874
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,279
pixar there's a few yes that just i'm on

875
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,880
a plane i don't want to cry and it

876
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,039
forces me i can't help it it just

877
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,519
strikes me with it and then also uh i

878
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,919
will also forcibly acquire tons of

879
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,760
nightmare fuel if i watch something like

880
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
texas chainsaw massacre so like the

881
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,000
vividness of media which it seems like

882
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
hollywood has really mastered can induce

883
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
a comprehension of something but what's

884
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
kind of odd about that is that it can be

885
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
completely irrational it can be based on

886
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
completely imaginary things and maybe

887
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,679
that's not the thing we want to be

888
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,039
angling toward but maybe there are

889
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,360
things that we can borrow from film and

890
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
vivid visual media to induce

891
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,479
comprehension of other things

892
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,399
yeah and the thing that i'm concerned

893
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,399
about especially when we're dissecting

894
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,760
uh

895
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,600
documentaries and the videos that people

896
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
make when they're warring over political

897
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
issues that slowly what that's doing is

898
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
building up strong emotional priors that

899
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
may be really difficult to overcome we

900
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
saw earlier in the beginning priors can

901
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,640
be

902
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,519
like very impactful in terms of how we

903
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,159
perceive things and so like should we be

904
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,760
more careful about the type of media

905
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,880
that we're absorbing into our psyche

906
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,399
i think art to a certain extent is

907
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,640
provocative and irresponsible

908
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,320
so thank goodness a lot of movies at

909
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,080
least in hollywood have trigger warnings

910
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,360
so we can avoid the nightmare fuel

911
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
but i also think that there's an

912
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,120
opportunity to start translating complex

913
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,960
civic knowledge into vivid rich media

914
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
interactions that could induce emotional

915
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
comprehension and potentially wisdom

916
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
through visual stimulation story and

917
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,600
media perhaps we could hack our way to

918
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
opt-in wisdom what would be the costs

919
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
would there be trauma could we make it

920
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,640
an informed consensual process does some

921
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
designer have to know what wisdom is

922
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,159
meant to be derived or isn't that

923
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,480
coercive or do we just need to make

924
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,279
knowledge vivid visceral experiential

925
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,279
what are the pitfalls will it be so

926
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
powerful that we'll need emotional

927
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
trigger warnings where could this go

928
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,519
wrong who decides what gets amplified or

929
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,640
should anyone do anything

930
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,880
uh in our database about diablo canyon

931
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
for example there are arguments about

932
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,840
the degradation of pipes and so would it

933
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,240
be ethical for us to highlight and

934
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
suggest that readers definitely look at

935
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
these photos how do we know that this

936
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,360
wouldn't be disproportionately

937
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
persuasive are the visuals important to

938
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,919
comprehending the nature of the

939
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
perceived and argued threat of the state

940
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,120
of the uh nuclear power plant and then

941
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
in the database also we have a long

942
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,200
timeline of incidents when pg e's

943
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,039
negligence has led to death and

944
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
destruction is it important to those who

945
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,960
are advocating that diablo canyon should

946
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
remain open but not be managed by pg e

947
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,519
that people look at these videos of the

948
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
fires and see the faces of the people

949
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
who have died in explosions and

950
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,679
disasters or is that too traumatizing is

951
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,840
that extraneous and unnecessary is it

952
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,919
too biasing because of how impactful

953
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,760
feelings are in our sense making and

954
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,600
decision making there are so many

955
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,000
pitfalls so many ways to err into bias

956
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
perception which is totally antithetical

957
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
to our mission even a single word can

958
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
accidentally add undue weight and then

959
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,039
there is the impossibility of accounting

960
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
for how people's priors can shape how

961
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
people perceive the things that they are

962
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,960
seeing i can't imagine it all can be

963
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
accounted for and yet if we even

964
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
marginally increase the wisdom of people

965
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,520
in general what kind of impact would

966
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
that have

967
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,440
well i'm afraid i probably left you with

968
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,199
way more questions than answers sorry

969
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,719
about that it was again a very late

970
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,159
night

971
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,159
but i think that we do have a series of

972
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,480
important questions to consider like

973
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,079
is it possible to augment human

974
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,760
intelligence to help people overcome

975
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,918
biasing priors in order to see problems

976
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
and solutions in new light but also in a

977
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,320
manner that isn't meant to just overtly

978
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,199
coerce or persuade if we were to design

979
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,960
technology to help us hack our way to

980
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
wisdom what kinds of emotional costs and

981
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,599
demands would that require i'm not sure

982
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,440
we at the society library would ever

983
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
dare to assume that we would know the

984
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
way to wisdom but beyond enabling

985
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,800
comprehension of the knowledge we're

986
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,879
working with today it seems like the

987
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,560
highest ideal of knowledge management

988
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
work so we would love to hear any ideas

989
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,560
you may have hackers

990
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,200
and thanks for listening

991
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:05,329
[Applause]

992
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,880
i think we have time for questions in

993
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
case any of y'all have any

994
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,960
yes

995
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,079
well my

996
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,680
um you know my job is pretty much not to

997
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
have opinions on the things that we map

998
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
um and i will say diablo canyon is a the

999
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
first collection we will actually be

1000
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,079
releasing because it is the only one

1001
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839
that has reached what we call meaningful

1002
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,960
completion climate change covid19

1003
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
election integrity these other topics

1004
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,760
that we've worked on are

1005
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,040
unbelievably enormous and what the

1006
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,720
society library is really trying to do

1007
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,200
is set a new kind of standard for rigor

1008
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
i mean like there's like

1009
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,280
a threshold of how rigorous people are

1010
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
when they're forming their arguments

1011
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,400
scholarly papers tend to perform the

1012
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,079
best that i've seen government

1013
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,480
documentation news and journalism kind

1014
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,079
of falls underneath i'm constantly

1015
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,640
shocked by like sub-standards of people

1016
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
not sourcing their references and things

1017
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,560
like that so the society library is

1018
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,119
really trying to just like

1019
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,839
introduce a new level of rigor a new

1020
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
almost kind of language for how to talk

1021
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,040
about our problems that is so

1022
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
ridiculously comprehensive that we're

1023
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,640
really trying to raise the bar so the

1024
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,400
diablo canyon issue is a state level

1025
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,680
issue and is something that we've been

1026
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,359
able to fundraise enough

1027
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,520
to reach meaningful completion and are

1028
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,040
releasing everything else still needs a

1029
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
lot more work because

1030
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
they're international issues they are

1031
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,240
enormous

1032
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,240
yes

1033
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
yeah that's a fantastic question and

1034
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
you're so perceptive i don't know how

1035
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
much information i revealed but you hit

1036
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
the nail on the head right now we are

1037
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,960
working on issues of contemporary

1038
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,520
importance that are oftentimes fleeting

1039
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,599
right now we're focused on high-impact

1040
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,280
persistent polarizing issues in the

1041
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
english-speaking united states having to

1042
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
do with human rights resource management

1043
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,359
et cetera but really the society library

1044
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,359
is a very long-term institution i'm

1045
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,880
concerned with i mean we've named

1046
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,240
ourselves the society library because

1047
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
i'm concerned with the knowledge

1048
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,200
infrastructure that future generations

1049
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
are going to be growing up with we have

1050
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,640
old institutions that have not yet been

1051
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,720
fully digitized and yet if we just

1052
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
directly digitize them which is a lot of

1053
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,240
what we've seen we've directly digitized

1054
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,079
the newspaper we've directly digitized

1055
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,680
the book we've maintained a lot of the

1056
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,119
structure and format i think that's

1057
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,880
inherently limiting so what the society

1058
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
library is looking to do is what are our

1059
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
information needs and what are the

1060
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
technologies that we have at our

1061
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,640
disposal to just like greatly amplify

1062
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
the ability to induce comprehension

1063
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,839
account for comprehensiveness yadda

1064
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,440
yadda so really the work that we're

1065
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
doing now is because it falls within our

1066
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
mission people are willing to fund it

1067
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,440
because they're interested in near-term

1068
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,599
present issues but really a lot of it is

1069
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
just r d to developing the pipeline for

1070
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,560
ingesting knowledge processing knowledge

1071
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,720
the ontological development and long

1072
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,839
term

1073
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,839
i think potentially even in my lifetime

1074
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,720
depend because of how unbelievable ai is

1075
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
accelerating with chain of thought

1076
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,240
reasoning and things like that

1077
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,599
i think we'll be able to see live

1078
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,839
libraries being generated in my lifetime

1079
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,760
which i you know would be an absolute

1080
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
dream come true but there's a number of

1081
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,400
different issues if you go to our

1082
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,160
website you can see like the full scope

1083
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
of the different topics that we would

1084
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
cover and um i think also that some

1085
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,839
issues are probably going to be

1086
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,440
persistently problematic especially

1087
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,920
around values and culture so those ones

1088
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
are things that we also cover and most

1089
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,280
likely we'll be mapping those things for

1090
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,240
a while

1091
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,118
yes yes yes

1092
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,240
go ahead yes

1093
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,720
biases but oh so we're actually

1094
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
radically inclusive so we have 22

1095
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,079
different methods for overcoming our own

1096
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,079
research biases and essentially the

1097
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,280
service that the sci library is

1098
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,520
rendering or one of the services is that

1099
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
we undertake the work of doing a lot of

1100
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
steel manning so like even if something

1101
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,760
seems like really obscure or extraneous

1102
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
we

1103
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
and like low quality content we treat

1104
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,440
those like hints and we spend a lot of

1105
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,119
time still mending then trying to find

1106
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,800
evidence for it like for example there

1107
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
was this one claim in the diablo canyon

1108
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,440
database uh people persistently on

1109
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
facebook and in blogs and even in news

1110
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,160
articles would just persist this idea

1111
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
that 1.5 billion fish would get i

1112
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
believe was in trained and like boiled

1113
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
and killed every year in the diablo

1114
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,480
canyon cooling system and we just

1115
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,320
couldn't find evidence for it and i was

1116
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,599
beginning to think like perhaps it was

1117
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,200
just a persistent myth we couldn't track

1118
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
down the providence

1119
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
eventually we found where the data came

1120
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
from and what's really wonderful is that

1121
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
now there's like this centralized source

1122
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,720
where there's so many different people

1123
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,240
who have referenced that number and now

1124
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,520
there's a citation that they can just

1125
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
link to um so we actually spend a lot of

1126
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,359
time like steel manning content we've

1127
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,440
got virtues and values on our page that

1128
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
guide our orientation towards um

1129
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,920
the information that we're interacting

1130
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,240
with essentially we consider our duty to

1131
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,480
leave no intellectual stone unturned and

1132
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,079
in general the culture of libraries is

1133
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,079
to be radically inclusive

1134
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,440
i encourage you all to check out the

1135
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,280
american library association's library

1136
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,200
bill of rights libraries are super

1137
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,960
radical they're like ridiculously

1138
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,680
anti-censorship it's like pretty awesome

1139
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,599
so we borrow a lot of that culture and

1140
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,040
have imbued it in our own research

1141
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
methods

1142
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,160
and we have found consistently time and

1143
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,000
time again that even if someone

1144
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
immediately discounts an idea or like we

1145
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,839
hear someone bring up an idea that

1146
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
sounds ridiculous if you just spend a

1147
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
little bit of time digging maybe the way

1148
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,119
in which that claim was expressed wasn't

1149
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,280
the best representation of the sentiment

1150
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
and is technically wrong but if you do a

1151
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
little bit of digging like it may just

1152
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,359
actually be a representation a malformed

1153
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,720
representation of something that is

1154
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,800
substantial and it probably is important

1155
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
that that could get surfaced and we're

1156
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
grateful to the people who whether it's

1157
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,839
on a conspiratorial website or an

1158
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,319
uncited rant online for bringing that to

1159
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,880
our attention

1160
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,079
yes

1161
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,440
uh

1162
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
is

1163
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
great okay so let me try and restate um

1164
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,640
the gist of what you asked um so correct

1165
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,160
me if i'm wrong but you are asking

1166
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,480
essentially uh you know how do we

1167
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
balance like arguments about

1168
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,440
moral conscience and values and things

1169
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,839
like that uh in comparison to collecting

1170
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,560
facts and data and whatnot is that about

1171
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,799
right

1172
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,599
yeah great

1173
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,319
so perfect uh so there's a very specific

1174
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,480
reason why i use the words arguments

1175
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
claims and evidence and that's because

1176
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,720
claims can be facts or opinions they

1177
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,319
could be moral arguments or they could

1178
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,200
be you know evidence-driven arguments um

1179
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
claims can be fact opinion right or

1180
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,599
wrong doesn't matter they're just claims

1181
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,119
they're assertions that something is

1182
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,280
true and someone can assert that it is

1183
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,599
morally right or morally true that

1184
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,119
something is done or not done and in

1185
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
fact for the diablo canyon content in

1186
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,280
that position one almost every single

1187
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,680
position has an entire ethics section

1188
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,359
where people argue about the ethics of

1189
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,520
something um which can be moral it can

1190
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,119
be religious i don't know if i know of

1191
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,640
any particularly like religious

1192
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,720
arguments in the nuclear powerpoint one

1193
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,200
but it's again we're very interested in

1194
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,640
being radically inclusive because what

1195
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,800
we're trying to do is create a one

1196
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
centralized repository library where

1197
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,319
someone can say listen i really want to

1198
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,560
know all dimensions of this issue and

1199
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
all dimensions definitely includes how

1200
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
people feel about it the opinions they

1201
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
have about it their morals their values

1202
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,480
it has a specific section right and it's

1203
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
identified as such unless that happens

1204
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,079
to be evidence to support it and then

1205
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,800
bam it's an evidence-driven claim

1206
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,480
but those are important dimensions to

1207
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
understanding ourselves as a collective

1208
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,480
and functioning as a democracy people

1209
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
cannot read those things if they choose

1210
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,280
they don't have to read everything in

1211
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,040
the library if they don't want to but i

1212
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,240
think it definitely deserves

1213
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,800
representation and so um how the second

1214
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
part of your question how do we uh

1215
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,680
promote that i mean

1216
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,319
it's our human right actually as defined

1217
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
by the united nations declarations of

1218
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,560
human rights to have opinions and also

1219
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,319
have religious beliefs i believe it's

1220
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,880
article 18 and 19. so it is inherently

1221
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,040
your human right to have an opinion have

1222
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
a belief and like it does need to be

1223
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
informed and no one has the right to

1224
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,200
really like challenge or try to coerce

1225
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,000
or change that um which is an ideal that

1226
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,599
i don't think we have fully realized

1227
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,680
because i think in order to realize the

1228
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,359
freedom of like having opinions and

1229
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,880
religious beliefs i think people should

1230
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,720
have the freedom of choice to begin with

1231
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,079
i think a lot of people inherit their

1232
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,839
religious beliefs nothing necessarily

1233
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,640
wrong with that but i think that even a

1234
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,359
library of religious perspectives as it

1235
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,480
relates to like fundamental

1236
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,560
philosophical questions about the nature

1237
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
of reality life in the universe

1238
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,760
um could be something that people could

1239
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,359
have access to so they can more freely

1240
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,119
choose what they want to believe and

1241
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,480
then that at least that's like a free

1242
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,560
choice as opposed to i've inherited this

1243
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,160
no one tried to take it away from me but

1244
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,760
ultimately like it's all of our human

1245
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,960
rights to believe whatever the heck we

1246
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,839
want to believe

1247
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,920
five minutes okay one more question yes

1248
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
okay

1249
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
uh

1250
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,319
is

1251
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,079
your question's about undue weight right

1252
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,680
and like platforming things and giving

1253
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,359
false equivalence does something look

1254
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,920
like uh it has

1255
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,839
weight it has validity just because it's

1256
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,079
right next to something that you know

1257
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,520
has a bunch of evidence and things like

1258
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,359
that so uh i don't know if you saw in

1259
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,440
the example but we actually do label

1260
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,240
claims so if something has no evidence

1261
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,920
there's a there's a whole taxonomy of

1262
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,280
different things where we describe

1263
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,400
something that we haven't been able to

1264
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
find evidence for it could be that no

1265
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,240
evidence was provided no evidence was

1266
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,319
found yet we need to look for evidence

1267
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,280
so there's like a whole like set of ways

1268
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,280
in which we label and contextualize data

1269
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,520
because we are also concerned with that

1270
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,000
if people are just like reading at face

1271
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,839
value all of these claims and absorbing

1272
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,119
them right what is that doing to their

1273
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
priors especially if they happen to

1274
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,599
already like have uh an inclination to

1275
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,680
believe a specific thing so we actually

1276
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,160
put notes in front of things so people

1277
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,000
see like this is a logical fallacy this

1278
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,079
is cherry picked data this is outdated

1279
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,520
we've not been able to find any evidence

1280
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,280
for this this is so vague it's actually

1281
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,520
not fact checkable like we let people

1282
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
know and then as you unpack things you

1283
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,440
can also see you know counter

1284
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,880
argumentation and what the counter

1285
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
argumentation is made out of so i mean

1286
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,319
this visualization the paper

1287
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,040
visualization is one of our our first

1288
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,480
iterations of how to express this

1289
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,880
knowledge i have no doubt and it is my

1290
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
hope that we will partner with designers

1291
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
that will make these things more obvious

1292
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,640
um because this is all very important

1293
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,680
right and this is kind of like getting

1294
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,520
to the gist of the talk is like how do

1295
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,960
we go about enabling comprehension

1296
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,440
there's so many facets of absorbing

1297
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
knowledge that are really important that

1298
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,040
we really need to be careful about in

1299
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,119
order to get as much knowledge in

1300
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,000
without

1301
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,920
like causing someone to end up at a

1302
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,359
certain conclusion or manipulating their

1303
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,280
thoughts so it's like just i think we're

1304
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,920
at the dawning of like a new era an

1305
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,680
enlightenment era of knowledge

1306
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,839
management and consolidation and

1307
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,200
presentation

1308
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,119
and um yeah i'm hoping there's just so

1309
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,720
much more to come so thank you so much

1310
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,240
for your concern we also have it

1311
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,839
yes quickly

1312
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,880
so

1313
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,839
sorry can you say that one more time

1314
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,919
or attributes

1315
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,880
so our um

1316
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,960
we don't necessarily drive anyone to a

1317
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,119
conclusion however

1318
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,960
the society library does build political

1319
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,720
decision-making models so we work at the

1320
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,480
city council level we essentially

1321
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,160
execute our method by extracting

1322
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,440
arguments claims and evidence from

1323
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,280
various forms of medium and instead of

1324
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,599
rendering it as debate maps what we do

1325
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,359
is we break down every single dimension

1326
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,200
of a decision which can be along

1327
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
categorical lines like economic or

1328
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,960
social or whatever sometimes it can be

1329
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,040
much more precise like those high level

1330
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,800
like vague orientations underneath

1331
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,640
economic and safety and those things

1332
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,839
that you saw

1333
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,760
and what we do is we show them here's

1334
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
the packet of pro con argumentation in

1335
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
each one of those dimensions and then we

1336
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,599
visualize that so they essentially micro

1337
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,760
vote i've got a talk on our website

1338
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,280
about how we do this and we actually

1339
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,760
give away a tool kit for making your own

1340
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,359
decision making models so one of the

1341
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,040
things that we do want to do is take our

1342
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,200
decision making model process digitize

1343
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,640
that and then make that an interface

1344
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,240
through which our data can be rendered

1345
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,599
so we're not going to tell anyone the

1346
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,800
decision that they should make right

1347
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,680
because

1348
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,200
some of the stuff is pretty subjective

1349
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,720
and value driven like do you value

1350
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,000
safety do you not care about the

1351
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,160
reputation of the utility like that's

1352
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,920
kind of subjective but if someone

1353
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,880
actually wanted to go through the

1354
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
process of methodically going through

1355
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,160
all of this knowledge we happen to have

1356
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,760
a process for that and it just takes

1357
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,079
them through step by step um so we're

1358
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,520
hoping to raise some funds actually

1359
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,599
we've got proposals out for that to be

1360
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,760
the next iteration of an interface for

1361
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,200
people to opt into and what's really

1362
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,880
cool about that is that once people go

1363
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,079
through the process they don't have to

1364
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,760
remember the decision that they made in

1365
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,119
the black box of their minds going

1366
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,400
through potentially thousands of

1367
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,160
arguments instead it mirrors back to

1368
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,839
them once you have gone through the

1369
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,520
process of looking at every dimension

1370
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,520
this is what you decide along economic

1371
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
environmental safety lines and that's my

1372
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,850
time thank you all so

1373
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:25,520
[Applause]

1374
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,760
and you much as long as you want okay

1375
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,920
thank you

1376
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,680
you
