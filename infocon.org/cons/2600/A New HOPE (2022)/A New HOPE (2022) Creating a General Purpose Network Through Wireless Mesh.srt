uh it is hope policy and we would like

7
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,400
you to make sure that you if you can

8

you know we're trying to be consistent

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
with our code of conduct that we set for

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
ourselves and so we want to keep

14

please meet your phone the audio

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,759
equipment is super sensitive so it picks

25
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
up most everything that happens

26
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,720
we have a set of unscheduled tracks or

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
an unscheduled track a 400 unscheduled

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,759
track where if you haven't proposed a

29
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,000
talk or a session you can propose one

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
today and go sign up for it go to the

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
info desk and they'll help you get

and lastly the first block of late night

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
mature content programming is in the

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,280
video room 406 fourth floor and will

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
begin tonight after 9 30. tonight's

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
video room late night theme is humor and

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
horror so expect the unexpected with

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
that this talk is

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
creating a general purpose network

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
through wireless mesh

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and this is jameson dungan and with that

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
we'll pass over to you jameson

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
thank you

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,879
thank you

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
hey we're all back at hope after four

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,959
years this is great i love hope it's one

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
of my favorite conferences new new venue

69
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
and everything too this is this is cool

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,959
you guys watching a lot of cool talks so

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,480
far yeah yeah i'm having so much fun too

72
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,519
all right so um i live in uh norfolk

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,159
virginia and i created a mesh net there

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,760
while i'm currently working on creating

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,319
the network there and um i'll give you a

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
little bit of a background of what's

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
going on with it and why i decided to to

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
take this on um i actually got the idea

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
from hope like

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,319
eight ten years ago something like that

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,840
when i saw the nyc mesh net but um i

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
wanted to create a general purpose

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
network that was not connected to the

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
internet that anybody in the city could

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
use or host stuff on or or contribute to

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,560
or whatever they wanted to do with it

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
and um that was part of it and i wanted

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
to make it kind of like the the early

89
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
90s internet where it was a lot of fun a

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
lot of zany art a lot a lot of

91
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,720
abstract kind of pointless stuff for for

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,400
fun art's sake but the other part was um

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
kind of like an emergency

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
communications network in case like

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
there's some kind of grid down thing and

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
i figured uh connecting people was

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,519
really important and if people had the

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
ability to communicate share data and

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
look at stuff maybe there wouldn't be as

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
much of a panic if something broke out

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,880
like something crazy happened like a

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,959
hurricane comes through or something so

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
that was my uh my motivation behind a

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
lot of the stuff so let's go through and

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
uh look at it so what is the mesh net a

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
lot of people might know some of these

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
things so we can review a little bit but

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
it's a um

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
decentralized network where all the

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,960
nodes connect to as many other nodes as

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
possible and it's usually uh

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
self-organizing self-healing there is no

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
like central authority so it's really

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
easy to uh make it fault tolerant and

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
and have a

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
lack of centralization

117
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,120
so uh

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
a lot of people are probably familiar

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
with the osi model i'm not going to go

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
too deep into this but the first three

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
layers are the the physical the data and

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
the network that's um like hardware

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
physical stuff like electrical impulses

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
on copper line stuff like that uh mac

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
addresses is the the that and then um

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
tcp or ip addresses and routing and

127
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,880
stuff like that is layer three so i'm

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
gonna stick to just those three and

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
that's what i've been working on with

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
the mesh net itself and uh yeah

131
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
this is the hardware i've been using um

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
ubiquity they make some really good

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
stuff it's pretty affordable i've been

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
using the m5 nano station

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
it's uh it's crazy range it's a

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
directional antenna it gets about 120

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,039
degree

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
sector kind of thing so three of them

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
makes a circle 120 240 360. and then the

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,960
other is uh access point so i'll get the

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,240
directional antennas to connect

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
buildings to buildings and then the

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
access points are your general wi-fi

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
access points that a lot of devices

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
would connect to

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
um you can get the stuff used for pretty

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
cheap on ebay like these things are like

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,240
15 10 bucks a piece or something like

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
that if you buy them in bulk they're a

150
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,520
little bit older so a lot of places have

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,199
phase stuff out but these things can do

152
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,080
300 megabits a second so

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
it's not super fast but that's pretty

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
fast for me you know that's all i need

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
and here's some pictures of what they

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
look like they're only about this big i

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
wanted to bring one but i didn't have

158
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
enough room

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
and um same with the access points a lot

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
of people phase these things out so you

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
can uh do this and what's great with

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
ubiquity is all the the software for

163
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
managing the stuff is license free so

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
you can you can host and manage like

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,440
it's made to design to make your own

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,120
like wireless internet service provider

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
or whatever you want so a lot of things

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,479
are built in like that

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,039
um so first thing you want to get a a

170
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,720
good kit to

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
um

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,400
crimp your your cables you don't want to

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
go cheap on ethernet cable you want to

174
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,639
get real good solid outdoor that

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
shielded cable that's one thing you

176
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
don't want to go cheap on you can go

177
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
cheap on the the used stuff but not this

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
you want to remember your uh color color

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
coordination however you you remember

180
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
that

181
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,039
and then um get a cable tester so you

182
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
can plug these in on different ends and

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
it will run through all eight lines you

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
can see which ones are there and hot and

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
this this is helpful if like one's on

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
the roof and the other is downside so

187
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,199
you got to go back and forth

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
but um here you go so once you get that

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,039
up you can start uh programming them get

190
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,639
in there and um name them configuring

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
them stuff like that

192
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
and then um

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
antenna bases also buy these in bulk

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
this is uh real good and then you see

195
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
here this is uh three of them that i

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,759
have and i started experimenting with

197
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,360
antenna bases

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
and uh these are um eight by tens you

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
wanna go real big so the wind don't

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,919
knock these things over and then i just

201
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
got a piece of pvc i think it was like a

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
inch and a quarter inch and a half i

203
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,360
can't remember and that extended it to

204
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
be about a six feet tall so that after

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
some iterations of trying that's what

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,599
i've come up with and that's lasted a

207
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
few years on a lot of roofs through a

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
lot of storms and stuff like that

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
haven't had any issues now

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
but um

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
i've made it so where you can see on the

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
far right picture i've got it so it can

213
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
flat pack it so it got it to where you

214
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,440
just bolt them together and you can

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
drive around like that in your car and

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
then it's easy to take these things up a

217
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
ladder onto the roof or something like

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
that because these things are really big

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,360
so trying to get them up there was was

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
hard and i learned a different way to

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
converge to something more like this

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,759
and this is what my car looked like it

223
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
looked like that for a couple years so

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
i'm always like kind of running this

225
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
stuff around but so so you want to get a

226
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
good spool of ethernet cable that's the

227
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
that's the the money that you're

228
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,240
spending right there you want to go a

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
solid copper not copper clad stuff like

230
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,440
that

231
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,639
um

232
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,720
here you can see um one of the old

233
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
antenna bases right here how it only

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
comes up to like right there you see how

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
skinny they are and stuff like that

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
compared to the longer newer ones

237
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
so uh those are two of the antennas that

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
we have up right now just as an example

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
for what they look like

240
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
here's kind of like a outside office

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
this is what i would do to work on these

242
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
things once i get them up there i'd get

243
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
a power supply because these things are

244
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,279
all run over uh power over ethernet and

245
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,560
get a little computer up there so you

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,600
can actually test and see if you're

247
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
getting signals and stuff like that and

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,640
actually connecting to these networks

249
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
then i did some war walking once i got

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,519
some uh of these towers up so i just got

251
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
a battery pack and a backpack and just

252
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,560
walked around with these things and i

253
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
could do a lot of signal testing go

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
around the city and see

255
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
where

256
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,839
you know where where good coverage is

257
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,120
and stuff like that and just get a basic

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
idea of what's going on got up on

259
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
rooftops like that and it was a lot of

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,120
fun once these things actually started

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
connecting so that's um

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
our downtown from where i just was in

263
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
that same picture just kind of like

264
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
looking off to the left and

265
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
i have an antenna from our maker space

266
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
to this place and then from this place

267
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
out to the downtown

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,839
and um

269
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
we went up on top of a parking garage

270
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,959
down there and actually connected and

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,160
this was like

272
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
awesome feeling because it actually

273
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
worked and you could actually get a

274
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
signal and you can see some of the the

275
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
specs there 300 megabits it was just

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
like a scene out of a movie or something

277
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
it made me feel really good you know

278
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,279
almost like this like that

279
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
because it connected you're on the roof

280
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
and stuff and i'm like yeah this is this

281
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
is working

282
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
so um here's where one of the the nodes

283
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
are this is our makerspace 757

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
makerspace if you're ever in norfolk

285
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,839
come visit i'd love to show you around

286
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
it's like the size of a block it's

287
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
awesome it's my favorite place i have

288
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,360
all kinds of stuff like this on the

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,320
inside

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
the other place down the street where

291
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
you just saw me on the roof is this this

292
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
was built in like the late 1800s and the

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
first floor is occupied but everything

294
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
else is abandoned and my friend runs a

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
tech company out of there and it's

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,519
really cool and right at the very top uh

297
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,600
right up in here is where the antenna is

298
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
and that's one of the highest parts in

299
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,440
the city in that area so you get amazing

300
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
coverage from there

301
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,440
and on the inside it looks like this oh

302
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
it's not auto plane

303
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
maybe it won't

304
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,959
well whatever

305
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
uh it's my friend's spot and he's got

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
some really cool drone stuff in there

307
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
it's all this this neat stuff but just

308
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,880
wanted to show what it looked like the

309
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
third place is um

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
slow dive gallery it's like this really

311
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
neat i don't think it's gonna play is it

312
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
yeah no

313
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
um it's like a venue art spot so those

314
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,160
are the three places that we have

315
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
antennas up right now that connect all

316
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,000
of them together i don't want to expand

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
it any more than this right now until we

318
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
actually get more functioning stuff but

319
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
i think this would be really cool

320
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,920
because there's three different places

321
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
that have very artsy neat feels to it

322
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
and i want to make some kind of

323
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,920
collaborative art thing to go on where

324
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,519
you can interact at all three places at

325
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,040
the same time and do some neat things

326
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
like one of the ideas was making

327
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,040
something like a holographic phone booth

328
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
that we're going to call a hollow booth

329
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
and you could get in there and talk to

330
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,680
people at other places and stuff through

331
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
like a high bandwidth network that's not

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
on the internet just through the city i

333
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
think that'd be pretty cool is like to

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
show other people get them interested

335
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
and using this network

336
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,279
so once you connect to yourself

337
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
what do you do

338
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
so you got to get some routing going on

339
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
so i got these things um these were

340
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
about 20 25 something that i don't know

341
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
what they are now with the chip shortage

342
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,399
and everything but uh the reason i

343
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,000
picked this is because they're um

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
they're called the nano pi rs2

345
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,839
they use a dual gigabit both ports are

346
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,480
gigabit they're powered over uh usb and

347
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,079
they that's just a little information

348
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
from the page right there powered off of

349
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
a sd card so you can get everything you

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
want on there and get all your different

351
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
routing protocols on there um this is

352
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
layer three like i was just mentioning

353
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
i'm still learning the routing stuff

354
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
i've been teaching myself this as i go

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
along and uh you just wanna you wanna

356
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
experiment you don't wanna worry about

357
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,639
failing you actually wanna fail a lot

358
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,880
and see how it works and it drives you

359
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,399
forward

360
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,600
so um

361
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
i want to get ospf on there because

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
that's a already standard that's open

363
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,360
shortest path first it's a routing

364
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
protocol

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
and you can um

366
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,600
that's that's already an established

367
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
protocol that's in use is very well

368
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
documented everybody a lot of people use

369
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
it so i want to get that up and running

370
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
to prove the network works but then i've

371
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
had my eye on this other routing

372
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
protocol that's still being developed i

373
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
i'm not sure if they have a full

374
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
rfc for it yet but it's called babel and

375
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
it's actually designed for mesh routing

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
and it takes this into effect and it can

377
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
actually weigh all kinds of neat values

378
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
on there to load balance not just

379
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,839
traffic but it can actually factor in

380
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
battery life and stuff like that and

381
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
distribute it through the network and

382
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
redirect like really really fast like

383
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
second by second it has a fast

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,399
convergent

385
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,160
on when links have died and how to

386
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
re-link and stuff like that

387
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
once i get this working that's when i

388
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,639
can scale the meshnet to open it up to

389
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,560
anybody and they can just add on to the

390
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
network

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
um you guys have probably seen these

392
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,279
things everywhere they've come to a lot

393
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,200
of major cities recently

394
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
when they first came to our city they

395
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
didn't work with the city and they

396
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
started impounding them like left and

397
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
right so we went to the city and said

398
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,959
can we get some of these and they're

399
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,240
like sure

400
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
so we started taking them apart

401
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,240
yeah

402
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
and uh man they have this awesome

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,279
battery pack in there so

404
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
yeah so um

405
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
we've got a bunch of them

406
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
and um

407
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,440
yeah we just started playing around with

408
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
this and the idea is i want to make a

409
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
project box and get everything i need in

410
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
a self-contained waterproof box and one

411
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,199
of these batteries and get a solar panel

412
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
with this so they would all be way more

413
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
resilient than way more robust and

414
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
harder to to take down

415
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,959
um

416
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,240
if you've never played with one of these

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,320
things this is like a whole rabbit hole

418
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
into itself these things are so cool the

419
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
sdr software defined radio

420
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
a lot of people probably know what this

421
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
is but if you don't

422
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,399
they're so cool look into it

423
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,399
but what you can do with these are some

424
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
really neat things

425
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,519
so um

426
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,320
adsb it's um automatic dependent

427
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,399
surveillance broadcast this is what

428
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,120
every single aircraft broadcast out it's

429
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,240
a 1090 megahertz and it broadcasts like

430
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
the heading the tail number all this

431
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
kind of stuff

432
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,320
and they even make a dongle specifically

433
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
just for this

434
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,800
but uh you can use this and just get a

435
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
simple antenna and it will give you data

436
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
like this and you can make a web server

437
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
that points from this and kind of

438
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,839
aggregates all this data but you can see

439
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
here it's like the uh the flight number

440
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
the altitude all this kind of stuff and

441
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
you can actually overlay it into a map

442
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
which is really neat because it will

443
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,639
actually draw like lines behind the

444
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
planes and stuff and you can get a real

445
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,720
cool visualization of of what's going on

446
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
so what i wanted to do is figure out

447
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
ways of getting information onto this

448
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
network without being on the internet

449
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
but have live updating

450
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
updating information

451
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
this is the same type of system but it's

452
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
for ships it's called ais and um the

453
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
same kind of thing you can actually get

454
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
a crazy amount of data that that this

455
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
stuff

456
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
goes it's like all about the ship

457
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
like the length of the ship you can even

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
sometimes in this tell where the beacon

459
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
on the ship is placed it's got all kinds

460
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
of neat stuff in there but you can pull

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
all this down and look at it and and map

462
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
it and do all kinds of neat stuff

463
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
um one of the other things this is not

464
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,360
too exciting but i think it's important

465
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
you could get a network time server on

466
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
there and you just get a simple glonass

467
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
gps dongle and you can connect directly

468
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
to the gps atomic clocks and pull down

469
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
very very high accurate time and that's

470
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
actually called a stratum one server

471
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
where you're directly connected to an

472
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
atomic clock so uh we have time and if

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
anybody needs that or wants that that's

474
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
a very important thing

475
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
is that it's not too fun but it's cool

476
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480
um this is neat if anybody's heard of

477
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
key wix just wiki backwards

478
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
what they what they do is um

479
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,600
the standard when you download this like

480
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
on your phone or to a raspberry pi it

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
will turn your phone into an access

482
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,000
point and you can host all of wikipedia

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
or whatever other file i'll get to that

484
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
in a minute on there and it will

485
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,120
actually broadcast from that

486
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
i did things a little bit differently

487
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
and didn't make it a wi-fi access point

488
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
i just made it a server

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,399
but um you can get these things called

490
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
zim files dot zim and it's just a single

491
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
file that is an entire

492
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,560
website compressed into that that thing

493
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,959
so i have all of wikipedia on that hard

494
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,480
drive you see right there and it's only

495
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
86 gigs pictures text everything it

496
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
looks like you're browsing wikipedia

497
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
just like it normally would but they

498
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,319
have tons and tons and tons of other

499
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,760
files that you can download things that

500
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
are in the public domain and stuff like

501
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
that

502
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,119
so

503
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
project gutenberg that's the

504
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,079
books that are in the public domain so i

505
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,160
have every single book

506
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,679
ever there's a public domain on there

507
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
that's only 70 or 67 gigs

508
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,559
i have all of stack overflow it's a it's

509
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,520
a little bit dated but it's 140 gigs so

510
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,039
again these are these things that just

511
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
in case something went down here's an

512
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
archived backup of it that anybody could

513
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
get to because i figured without stuff

514
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
like stack overflow how would you look

515
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,919
up

516
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
any kind of codes or any anything to

517
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,039
troubleshoot stuff nobody has that stuff

518
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
memorized

519
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
um there's medical encyclopedias on

520
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,799
there there's um i have like every ted

521
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,880
talk on there because those are free in

522
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
the public domain um crash course videos

523
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
those are uh pbs like sciencey history

524
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
kind of things so and this is constantly

525
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,480
being added to and growing so

526
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
there's always new zim files i want to

527
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
learn how to actually make your own zim

528
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,039
file where you can scrape something and

529
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,360
throw it on there but uh that's that's

530
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
that for right there

531
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,679
and then um i started uh i designed a

532
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,919
little little pie rack and so i could

533
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,000
stack them and if anybody's interested

534
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
in this laser cut file i can share it

535
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
later but um make a little little pie

536
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,080
rack and then each one of these would do

537
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
a specific function of that sdr thing

538
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
one of them would be the plane tracking

539
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
one of them would be the time one of

540
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
them and uh it's not the neatest or the

541
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
prettiest but that's uh

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
that's it right there and again it just

543
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,679
has to work it doesn't have to be the

544
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
best like some of these switches are old

545
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,919
but they were free you know so hey that

546
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,280
works right

547
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
um

548
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,360
you can get in browser emulators running

549
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,640
on this so this is something my friend

550
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
actually is hosting on the mesh net

551
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
right now and he's got every kind of

552
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,039
like retro game on there and you just

553
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
browse to this this address on the

554
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
meshnet and you can pick whatever rom

555
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,600
you want and just start playing it right

556
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
there in browser it doesn't matter your

557
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
device

558
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
it's pretty cool

559
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
um i wish i had some pictures of this

560
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
but my friend is making a um he got real

561
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
real motivated by this and since it's

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
not on the internet and people are going

563
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
to go to

564
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
normal domains like facebook or

565
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,120
something like that he wants to make

566
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,919
these vandalized like prank versions of

567
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,440
him so he wants to make face bork where

568
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,799
there's like dogs on there and stuff and

569
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
like bitter which all these like angry

570
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
things so those i just wanted to inspire

571
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,360
people to do stuff like this and use it

572
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
in creative ways kind of again like i

573
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
was saying with the early 90s internet

574
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,799
of just kind of fun artsy zany things

575
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,919
um

576
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
so this is where it gets pretty neat um

577
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
noah the weather satellites they

578
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
broadcast some some really neat stuff

579
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
and uh you can tune into them

580
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,799
noaa's 15 18 19 they're all analog

581
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,760
signal 20 is digital there's a um

582
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
russian meteor satellite that you can

583
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,880
also

584
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,000
tap into

585
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
these things slowly

586
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
break down over time but they launch new

587
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,000
ones so this is like constantly evolving

588
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,799
kind of stuff but um this is what it

589
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
looks like the analog video feed it it

590
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,840
if you get the sdr waterfall it gives

591
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
you this kind of neat looking pattern

592
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,480
right here

593
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
and um we can actually hear what it

594
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
sounds like

595
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,320
yeah see that's actually the sound of

596
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,799
the satellite so you can know when you

597
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
point it directly at it but you need a

598
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
special type of antenna

599
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
to actually uh

600
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
decode this so this is what it transmits

601
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,799
right here there's two channels left and

602
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
right and then they have these bars on

603
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,880
the side

604
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
and uh there's a website that will

605
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
actually help you build these specific

606
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,400
antennas to the exact tuning length that

607
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
you want so this is a 137 megahertz and

608
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
it's a double cross antenna because the

609
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
uh we'll learn in a minute but the the

610
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
signal itself is actually two components

611
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
working together

612
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,039
for uh this is for yeah yeah

613
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,679
and um

614
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
yeah so this is when i was trying to

615
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
track noaa 19 for the very first time

616
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,240
and we actually got a signal

617
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
and it wasn't the clearest

618
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,480
but we picked it up and it looked like

619
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,360
this

620
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
and i know that doesn't look like much

621
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,520
but i consider this a partial success

622
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
and part of me wants to tell you that um

623
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,440
you should show your results like this

624
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
even if they're not the prettiest like

625
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,559
don't just do a custom choice of like

626
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,799
the the coolest looking outcomes you

627
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,280
show all the outcomes that you make and

628
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,039
you can see right here there's those

629
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,960
black bars and that there is actually

630
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
some kind of pattern in here and i found

631
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
out later i used the the wrong

632
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
resistance wire and stuff like that so

633
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
this is how you learn you got to try and

634
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,360
keep iterating and go faster but these

635
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,960
are some pictures that i didn't pull

636
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
down but this is what they they look

637
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
like and you can see um the bars here

638
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,039
and stuff like that but they come in

639
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,520
different infrared spectra that you can

640
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
pick up so when you color correct those

641
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
you can get stuff like this and you can

642
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
look at like different vegetation you

643
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
can look at water temperature

644
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
atmospheric

645
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,559
humidity stuff like that it's really

646
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,760
neat but this is still uh analog

647
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,559
what i want to do is make something a

648
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
little bit better get better

649
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,480
um

650
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
resistant cable here i went ahead and

651
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
got um grounding rods that were almost

652
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
the exact length i needed and they're

653
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
covered in copper they're not solid

654
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
copper but that's okay

655
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
and this is the style of antenna i would

656
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
need to build for that this is not my

657
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
antenna here this is just a picture but

658
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,919
um

659
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,840
i'm going to correct this because that's

660
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,799
how we we get better

661
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,080
but what's really neat is um noah 16 and

662
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
17. these are really far away uh 22 000

663
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,080
miles out there and they're actually

664
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
geostationary orbits so they stay in one

665
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
spot in the sky and these send down high

666
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
amounts of data a really high resolution

667
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
there's 16 different channels so you can

668
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,440
look at

669
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
all and that that's only what's unlocked

670
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
they actually have a whole lot more that

671
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
is not in the public but like some of

672
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,320
these look at the sun and you can get

673
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
all the cool sun flares and stuff like

674
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,200
that but what you see here is um it's

675
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
almost like an 8k picture that comes

676
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
down and each channel one comes down

677
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,520
every 30 minutes so it's like constantly

678
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
shooting out new stuff

679
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
and um these are the coverage that it

680
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,080
gets so you can get from the tip of

681
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
australia uh africa right here so to see

682
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
the uh hurricanes that come off right

683
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
here and he goes all the way to uh like

684
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
new zealand and australia

685
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
and that if you can see both at the same

686
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
time and where we are you actually can i

687
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,640
only have a googo 16 which is this one

688
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
goes 17 is over here and they actually

689
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
just launched a new one that's coming

690
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
online right now it's already

691
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
broadcasting but they're moving it over

692
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,559
it goes 18

693
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,679
and uh

694
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,039
it's really cool

695
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,080
but um

696
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
sometimes it's easier not to reinvent

697
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,400
the wheel and there's actually a kit on

698
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,159
amazon you can get i know that's not

699
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
very hackery but if you want to start

700
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,039
pulling down signals you can right now

701
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
and what's neat is they actually have a

702
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
specific filter just for the go

703
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
satellites that will

704
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
block everything out and amplify just a

705
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
narrow bandwidth and then this is just a

706
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
sdr dongle specifically for this

707
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
and when i first got my antenna i was so

708
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
excited i slept next to it that night

709
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
because i couldn't wait to like wake up

710
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,679
the next morning and put it together and

711
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,960
start doing stuff so it's like christmas

712
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
morning for me you know

713
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,039
there i am with it and i was really

714
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,919
excited and um use the same kind of

715
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,919
antenna base that i'd been using before

716
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
to to make this and i just put it

717
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,720
outside of our maker space on the ground

718
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,679
and i left it out there to weather test

719
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
it and just see everything that was

720
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
going on before i put it up on the roof

721
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
it was out here for a few months and

722
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
everything worked great got a little

723
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
project box like this and everything's

724
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,960
the pies in there and everything

725
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,240
everything was great everything's been

726
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
waterproof and this is the filter the

727
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
filter has to be very close to the

728
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
actual receiver so you don't have the

729
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,760
the loss of the line

730
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,840
but um you'll start getting packets from

731
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,960
space like this

732
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,520
and um it makes some really really cool

733
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,559
pictures

734
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,000
so here's one of them that i pulled down

735
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,760
this is actually my birthday last year

736
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
but i've been tracking this all year and

737
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,279
you can actually put them together and

738
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
make some really cool gifts i wanted to

739
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
make one but it crashed the program

740
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,799
trying to load it in here because they

741
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,400
are like hundreds of megabytes per gif

742
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,120
it's crazy so um i just went to the noaa

743
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
website itself and just kind of oh it's

744
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
not gonna work yeah

745
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
um

746
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,679
i'll just tell you what it is because it

747
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
was really cool it's a picture of the

748
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,480
earth at the same time of day every

749
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
single day for a whole year so you see

750
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,039
the equinox and the solstice and the

751
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,279
light shift back and forth and it it

752
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,279
it's really cool i wish i could show you

753
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,919
use your imagination

754
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,120
um

755
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
let's keep going

756
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
who knows who uh cloud shannon is this

757
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
this guy is awesome yeah right right

758
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,520
he's one of my heroes well

759
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
hazel he's the father of information

760
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,120
theory he's the one who first used the

761
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,720
word bit he didn't create the word bit

762
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,520
but first to use it in a paper and

763
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
he was the one who first converted the

764
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,559
phones to digital and figured out you

765
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,120
could make essentially all information

766
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
uh boolean kind of output

767
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,480
but what was cool about this guy is um

768
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
he he did all kinds of like silly things

769
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
if you've seen the the do nothing

770
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,760
machine it's like a little switch and

771
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,039
like you switch it a little hand comes

772
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,039
off and turns itself off that's all it

773
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,520
does he would make stuff like that just

774
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
kind of as a joke but it was like

775
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,640
intellectually curious sydney but he he

776
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
juggled and he rode unicycles and he did

777
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
all these really crazy things and as i

778
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,880
was building

779
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
these different antennas and learning

780
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,159
about digital information learning about

781
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,960
him

782
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
i got more into the same stuff without

783
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,679
knowing that he did these things too

784
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,360
and started doing a lot of flow art

785
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,520
stuff and um i'll get into that in a

786
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,240
minute but um the digital signal that i

787
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
wanted to learn how how does this noaa

788
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,679
satellite get

789
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
the these signals back in such high

790
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,799
bandwidth and stuff like that and

791
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,279
there's something called qpsk uh

792
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,919
quadrature phase shift key and what it

793
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,480
means is you have um a sine and cosine

794
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
wave they're they're 90 degrees out of

795
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
phase and it was neat i was learning all

796
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,360
about this and it actually uses like the

797
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
complex plane which is like the

798
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,480
imaginary number set and stuff i had to

799
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,159
learn all about that teach myself this i

800
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,919
didn't know any of this stuff and it was

801
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,000
blowing my mind it was really cool but

802
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,679
what you can essentially do

803
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,799
is

804
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,679
the

805
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,039
i guess you would say the horizontal and

806
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,960
the vertical components are independent

807
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
and you can modulate each one of them in

808
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
the same signal without interfering with

809
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
them so you can make this sort of

810
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
circular diagram and

811
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
with that you have these four points up

812
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
in here

813
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
and there's going to be noise in any

814
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,360
signal so you can approximate what

815
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,880
corner it was trying to go for but you

816
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
can get two bits out of each single dot

817
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
with that with that phase shift and you

818
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,360
can see it a little bit better here this

819
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
green line that's the um

820
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,600
what they call the in phase and the

821
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
quadrature components

822
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,679
and together it creates this wave and

823
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
that wave is the actual

824
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
data containing wave that's what you

825
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,200
would actually want to record if you

826
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
wanted to to redo something but you can

827
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,399
see here by by adjusting the red and the

828
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,480
blue lines you can get into any of those

829
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,559
four corners that you you need and

830
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,000
that's how the signal is actually

831
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
transferred

832
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,399
so um there's cloud shannon and uh this

833
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,760
is the kind of stuff you do you just

834
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
like juggle on unicycles and stuff like

835
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
that and the funny thing was when i was

836
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,440
building my antennas and i need like a

837
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
few breaks and walk around i'll set my

838
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,799
antenna down

839
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
and there was a unicycle right next to

840
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,559
it i didn't know any of this stuff so it

841
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,919
was really kind of neat how it kind of

842
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
converged onto that but what i would do

843
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,279
to kind of clear my mind was we got into

844
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,279
flow arts and and spinning fire this is

845
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
outside of our making maker space and um

846
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,279
oh the videos aren't gonna load

847
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,320
but um

848
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,679
we would do different things where we'd

849
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
do like essentially like tightrope

850
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,039
walking while we're doing these

851
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,559
different things and

852
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
the point that i'm bringing this up for

853
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
which i think shannon probably did

854
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
here's some of the pictures that i'm i'm

855
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,240
going to use um

856
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
when i was learning this stuff they

857
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,919
would teach you to to stay in four

858
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,600
quadrants of your body like to do stuff

859
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
up here up here down there and that's

860
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,279
right when i was learning about the uh

861
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,039
the four phases

862
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
so what's neat is you have

863
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,919
um

864
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,000
led and fire people doing this stuff but

865
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,480
over here is the iq

866
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
signal and it was very

867
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
weird that all these things kind of

868
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,039
lined up at the same time that

869
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,840
so one of the things we want to do is um

870
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
figure out how we could actually spin

871
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
and create digital signals and have a

872
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,679
camera watches and have maybe like a

873
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
metronome or something to do like our

874
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,200
time stamp or like click out loud like

875
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
once per second and you could spell out

876
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,320
things or do some kind of signal we we

877
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
want to do that make some sort of

878
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
software that interprets the visual

879
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
stuff and

880
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,120
see if we can make it say like hello

881
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,440
world or something as we're spinning

882
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,399
but um the reason i bring this up is um

883
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,159
if anybody knows what your cerebellum is

884
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,000
it's back here it's that's where like

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,159
two-thirds of your neurons are

886
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
and the the reason i'm saying this is

887
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,960
a lot of your brain that's like your

888
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
motor memory kind of stuff it's a

889
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
non-conscious part so a lot of what you

890
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
think you are in a lot of your conscious

891
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
self is

892
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,960
not what your whole brain is so i think

893
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
by getting into these different modes

894
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,159
and and doing things like that you

895
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,679
actually start thinking in different

896
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,120
ways and using different parts of your

897
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
brain actually helped me problem-solve

898
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
in ways if if you're uh kind of like 80d

899
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,320
or adhd like i am that really helped me

900
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,559
focus a lot and um if you don't want to

901
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
do flow arts one thing you can try to do

902
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
is like brush your teeth with the other

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,240
hand it really makes you concentrate and

904
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,399
and be in the moment and i i suggest you

905
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
try that it's really cool

906
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
but um

907
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,799
from here on i'm gonna talk about um

908
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,039
radio stuff if anybody has their ham

909
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,000
radio it's it's really cool but this is

910
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,440
all the stuff from here on forward you

911
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,159
have to have a license to do

912
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,960
but um i just got my license in february

913
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,600
um ko4 wcs yeah

914
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
i encourage all you all to get yours too

915
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,399
it's really easy and really fun and

916
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
thank you for that yeah

917
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
um

918
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
aprs this is a really neat system it's

919
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
automated packet reporting system it was

920
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
actually made in the 80s and it uses the

921
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,000
ax 25 packet it's a digital packet and

922
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,039
um

923
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,200
it it goes up to layer two but it has

924
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,600
some like routing into it and what's

925
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
really neat is there actually has like a

926
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,919
ttl time to live kind of thing built in

927
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,679
so as you send out a transmission you

928
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,720
can at the end of it do like 3-3

929
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
and it will hop three times then through

930
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
these digipeaters and eventually you

931
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
want to hit something called an eye gate

932
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,080
and it will inject it into the internet

933
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,360
itself

934
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,159
um

935
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,240
these are standards so like all of north

936
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
america has one frequency 144.39 but

937
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
these are all over the world and what's

938
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,480
really neat about this is you can get 16

939
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
different beacons with your

940
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,760
um

941
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
what they call an ssid but it's not the

942
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,519
same as a wi-fi as this id it's

943
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,840
essentially your ham radio

944
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,960
call sign

945
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
and

946
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
you don't have to actually be there so

947
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
you can make like weather balloons or

948
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,559
weather stations or something like that

949
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,039
that report back different data

950
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,640
and what's neat about and they look kind

951
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
of like that like traditionally the

952
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
weather balloon buoy kind of things but

953
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
you can you can make your own

954
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
with things like this so um one of these

955
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,039
things that i just got recently it's um

956
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
these things are called terminal node

957
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,919
controllers it's essentially just a

958
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
radio modem it's nothing too fancy but

959
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,600
they used to be really complex in the

960
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,559
80s

961
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,480
and you don't even really need this you

962
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
could just get a sound card to to do all

963
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
the work and emulate it in software but

964
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,159
what this thing does is i actually have

965
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,440
one right here

966
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
um it connects over bluetooth so i can

967
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,919
connect with my phone

968
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,960
to the

969
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,360
device and then the device just goes

970
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
over analog audio into the radio

971
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,919
and i can do something from my phone i

972
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,760
can like send out a message so what's

973
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,200
neat is you can actually do like text

974
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
messaging from radio to radio with these

975
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,440
things send your gps coordinates stuff

976
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,320
like that and you can be in the middle

977
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,840
of nowhere you can be like hiking in the

978
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
woods out in the ocean

979
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,200
literally wherever and these these

980
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,519
things would communicate together

981
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
um this is just a better picture of what

982
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,440
i have right here

983
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
and uh it just straps to the back a lot

984
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
of people probably have these balfing

985
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,960
radios they're like 20 30 bucks they're

986
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
really cool if you don't have one i

987
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
suggest get one before the price goes

988
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,919
crazy high

989
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,720
but um you can get something called aprs

990
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
droid on your phone and you actually

991
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,159
don't even need that like i said you

992
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,760
could just plug directly in if you still

993
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,679
have a headphone jack on your phone and

994
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,120
plug in this is just nice because it's

995
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
wireless so i could have this like in a

996
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
backpack or something like that

997
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
but um

998
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,559
you can overlay all this data onto a map

999
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,240
and it's in real time so you can have

1000
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,519
like tracking things and you can see

1001
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
where people are and then you can click

1002
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,399
on them and send them like a text

1003
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,159
message and they can reply back to you

1004
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,360
and stuff

1005
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
but this is what's really neat is um

1006
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
there is one

1007
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,840
thing that you can if you if you compose

1008
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,679
the message just right and you get all

1009
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,000
the syntax in there you

1010
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,159
send a message to sms gte sms gate and

1011
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,239
add the phone number to it this will

1012
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,639
text an actual cell phone so it goes

1013
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,239
from radio to rf out hops as many times

1014
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,760
through the digipeater eventually gets

1015
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,280
injected into the the eye gate through

1016
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
the internet to the internet

1017
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
it will go through the internet and then

1018
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,719
be rebroadcasted through the the

1019
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,359
cellular service and be sent to the cell

1020
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,440
phone the cool part is the cell phone

1021
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
can then reply to that message and it

1022
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,280
will go all the way back through and you

1023
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
will get it back out on your radio

1024
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
you can do this anywhere in the world

1025
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
and it's free you just have to actually

1026
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,719
have good coverage to do this and that's

1027
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,560
the problem with the aprs system is it's

1028
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,879
not really well built out i mean it kind

1029
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,639
of is but it needs better better

1030
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,918
coverage

1031
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,879
so i'm building a digipeater for the

1032
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,200
mesh net right here and um i don't have

1033
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
a power supply for it yet but i got the

1034
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
rack mount right there

1035
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,599
and um

1036
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,119
this is cool this is actually a little

1037
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,680
side note this is from wnyc radio they

1038
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
gave us their old rack from they're

1039
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,040
cleaning out their old equipment and

1040
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
somehow ended up in norfolk and we got

1041
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,760
it

1042
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,800
but um

1043
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
here we go this is the um antenna that i

1044
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,520
bought and i actually got high gain um

1045
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
cable for this the the cable was more

1046
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,240
than the damn antenna but um

1047
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
here is um the radio modem essentially

1048
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,000
it's a tnc and there's a

1049
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
little group a radio amateur radio group

1050
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,800
that makes and sells these and they plug

1051
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
into raspberry pi's they only go 9 600

1052
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
baud

1053
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
not very fast but it's faster than zero

1054
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
and if you're just doing text documents

1055
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
or just texting

1056
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
this is really cool and you can ssh into

1057
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
the mesh net i wanted to actually get

1058
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,640
that up and running to show you guys but

1059
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
didn't have enough time to do that but i

1060
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,800
could ssh without a direct line of sight

1061
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,560
just from this thing into my network and

1062
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
then like work on the servers or

1063
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
something so i think that's pretty cool

1064
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,200
um

1065
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,160
one caveat of of all this that i i must

1066
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,839
tell everybody that you know the hacker

1067
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,880
group for some reason um

1068
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
amateur radio you cannot encrypt

1069
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,640
anything

1070
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,119
which sucks but

1071
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
there's one one rule that's exception to

1072
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
that if you are sending command and

1073
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,280
control kind of things you are allowed

1074
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,440
to encrypt

1075
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
don't take this from me but i would say

1076
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
ssh into something as command and

1077
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
control i don't think that's really

1078
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
bending the rules so

1079
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,359
i think it's fine to use that for

1080
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,560
encryption because that you wouldn't

1081
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,960
want to just like connect unsecurely to

1082
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,920
that

1083
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,040
but um

1084
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,560
the software you can run on this is

1085
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,640
called exaster and it's free for it's

1086
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
open source for any platform but you can

1087
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,480
install these on the raspberry pi's and

1088
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,359
then

1089
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,880
these would generate the packets the

1090
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,599
package would go into the tnc modem and

1091
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,160
then off to the rf or backwards and

1092
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,440
receive it and they can digipeat this to

1093
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
where they kind of like store and

1094
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
forward it it's really just like a

1095
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,480
millisecond delay and it re-broadcast or

1096
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
you can inject it into the internet um i

1097
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
want to figure out how to inject this

1098
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,599
into the mesh net and not go into the

1099
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,480
internet

1100
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
and have it be able to pick up and map

1101
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,880
stuff and be able to to repeat and kind

1102
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,680
of

1103
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,280
hop multiple multiple pathways like that

1104
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,160
um

1105
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,200
has anybody heard of net44 ampernet i'd

1106
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
never heard of this okay some people i i

1107
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,599
ask a lot of rowdy or network people

1108
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,520
they've heard of it but nobody really

1109
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,440
knew anything about it and i when i

1110
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
found this it it

1111
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,839
like wow so there's a slash eight

1112
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,079
network space um what that means is uh

1113
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,880
44 dot then anything in those next three

1114
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,760
octets that's a part of the entire thing

1115
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
so it's like 17 million i think

1116
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
addresses that could be wrong but yeah i

1117
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,359
think it's about 17 million addresses um

1118
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
this was set aside when radio was first

1119
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
created like

1120
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
i

1121
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
don't take me for this exactly i think

1122
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,000
it was in like the 70s or the 80s or

1123
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,839
something like that they they reserved

1124
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,040
this address space just for this and um

1125
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,280
it's largely unknown and unused and uh

1126
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,359
they just recently sold off a quarter of

1127
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,040
it to amazon because so much of it

1128
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,240
wasn't used but they still literally

1129
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,320
have millions of addresses left

1130
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,119
and what's good about this though is um

1131
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
they are now using that money to

1132
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
self-sustain this entire project so it

1133
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
has like money indefinitely now to keep

1134
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,720
this working

1135
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,760
but if you have a ham radio call sign

1136
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,400
you can go to this website and request

1137
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,920
ipv4 address blocks it it's really cool

1138
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,200
because those have been exhausted and

1139
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,640
they're hard to get

1140
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
you can go get like 10 000 of them or

1141
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
something if you want the only thing is

1142
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,720
you have to use this for radio

1143
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
and then the other thing is um it's kind

1144
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
of like the og dark net the um

1145
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,079
your home routing and a lot of home isps

1146
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,119
they will not route to the 44 network

1147
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,599
but um oh i meant to say ampernet stands

1148
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,640
for um amateur packet radio network so

1149
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
it's literally exactly what i wanted was

1150
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,680
packet radio with ip addresses so

1151
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,119
i'm going to try to figure out how to

1152
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,480
use this to use it on our meshnet to to

1153
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,160
name all the nodes and give them give

1154
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,800
them ip addresses and stuff um i need to

1155
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
look more into detail about legal not

1156
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,240
legally but technically what you're

1157
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,599
supposed to use them for and not use

1158
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,280
them for like you can't make an isp with

1159
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,440
this even though i'd want to and stuff

1160
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
like that

1161
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
um another thing um

1162
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
i'm showing these as examples for the

1163
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,480
mesh net itself there's uh the internet

1164
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,800
linking radio linking project what's

1165
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
neat about this is they're trying to

1166
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
connect all these repeaters and all

1167
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,560
these different radios literally around

1168
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,960
the entire world through the internet so

1169
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,400
if i just had a

1170
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,160
phone or any kind of internet connected

1171
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,960
thing

1172
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,359
i could use my voice on that it would go

1173
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,720
through the internet actually i have a

1174
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,599
little thing

1175
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,320
and there's something like a um like a

1176
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,480
zip code essentially that you can dial

1177
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,200
in

1178
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
to that part of the world and see where

1179
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,800
these towers are so i could look up like

1180
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
one in europe somewhere like

1181
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
specifically germany or something like

1182
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
that type that in

1183
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
and it would re-transmit over rf in

1184
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
germany so i could talk to my friend

1185
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
through the internet over there and he

1186
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,720
could reply back through this so i think

1187
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,119
these things are neat examples of stuff

1188
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,839
like peripheral internet where you're

1189
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,440
connecting networks together and it's

1190
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
kind of like a non-traditional use of

1191
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,560
the internet

1192
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,880
echolink does the same kind of thing

1193
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,960
where you can um connect different

1194
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560
things all around the world and they

1195
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,760
eventually want to get it to where you

1196
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,359
could just use one of these things and

1197
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
call anywhere on the planet with it so

1198
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
that's that's pretty ambitious but i i

1199
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,359
think it's awesome

1200
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,960
um winlink is really really cool this is

1201
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,720
a global radio internet or email

1202
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,800
and um it looks kind of like just a

1203
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,520
basic mail client inbox kind of thing

1204
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,040
like outlook or whatever

1205
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,560
you can either use this like i was just

1206
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,319
saying through the internet but this is

1207
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,800
completely independent you can use these

1208
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
these don't have a dedicated frequency

1209
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
either you can use them on like hfs in

1210
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,599
them all around the world so this is

1211
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,359
kind of like your post-apocalyptic

1212
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,079
internet um email service right here

1213
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,119
but it it it's really neat because um

1214
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,319
it it

1215
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,000
yeah you can send all kinds of cool

1216
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
stuff

1217
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,160
there's a a guy that does this um this

1218
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
is his call sign right here but he lives

1219
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,839
way up in the the northern latitudes and

1220
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,839
he'll go camping with like fold out

1221
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,520
solar panels and stuff and people said

1222
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,200
like you couldn't do this

1223
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
and he's just proving them wrong showing

1224
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
that you can send all this stuff and

1225
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,520
he'll make all these cool connections

1226
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,920
all around europe from like way up here

1227
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,440
and he barely gets any sunlight and

1228
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,720
stuff like that and somehow he's still

1229
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
able to do all this stuff

1230
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,040
so if part of the internet were to go

1231
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,160
down you could actually send this to a

1232
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,920
part of the world where the internet is

1233
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,160
working and inject it over there or just

1234
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,079
everything is down you could communicate

1235
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,560
independently with this

1236
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,839
um

1237
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,000
this was a good moment for me because

1238
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,160
i've been building this network for

1239
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
like in my hobby time for a few years

1240
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,680
now just on and off because you know we

1241
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,440
got jobs and lives and stuff and it's

1242
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,359
expensive and hard and

1243
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,280
i found this it's a amateur radio

1244
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,839
emergency data network data specifically

1245
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:10,960
and when i looked at this i was like

1246
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,640
hold on wait a minute

1247
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,040
that looks like the the nanostation m5

1248
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,599
that i've been using and it exactly is

1249
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,520
so there's already a pre-established

1250
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,079
protocol and standard amongst hams to

1251
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,079
make something essentially like the mesh

1252
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
net i've been trying to make with the

1253
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,880
same hardware with the same sort of

1254
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,280
goals in mind of creating um an

1255
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
emergency data network in case things go

1256
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,800
down you could still have communications

1257
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
and you could drop pins in places and be

1258
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,440
like oh there's hazards here let's meet

1259
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,319
here

1260
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,000
you know that kind of thing

1261
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
um yeah that's some of their um their

1262
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
their stuff but they already have

1263
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
protocols made so you have like voip

1264
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,680
phones and all these things in there and

1265
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,119
you can just set the stuff up and they

1266
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,280
actually have a um

1267
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,760
a usb drive that has everything on it

1268
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,040
all the routing and everything you can

1269
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,599
plug it right in and it just works so i

1270
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,640
kind of want to use this as a

1271
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,359
like a overlap with my existing network

1272
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,800
and this might actually make me look a

1273
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,160
lot more creditable when i go to

1274
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
different tall towers and say hey can i

1275
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,520
get on your roof and put this like

1276
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
anarchist net thing up there but it's

1277
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,640
like no no there's actually an

1278
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,359
established arden net that that hams use

1279
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,119
and it looks a lot more professional and

1280
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,200
i think that would help open up doors to

1281
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,720
to letting me do this

1282
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
and it's not just me alone doing this

1283
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,880
now there's hams not just in my local

1284
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,480
town but all over the world that would

1285
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,400
have this sort of protocol so i kind of

1286
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
want to overlap the two like a venn

1287
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,480
diagram where there's a lot of a lot of

1288
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,240
same things on here

1289
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,200
um

1290
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
yeah that's a good amount of time so

1291
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,400
this is the end right here um i'm

1292
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,240
jameson dungan if you want a copy of the

1293
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,160
slide email me right there or if you

1294
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,480
need the any plans or anything i've done

1295
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,640
i'll help send it to you um go ahead and

1296
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,520
look up

1297
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,000
757 makerspace that's where i hang out

1298
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,599
like i said if you're ever in that area

1299
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,119
super cool look up nfk mesh net and um

1300
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,880
be excellent to one another and hack the

1301
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,560
planet

1302
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,799
all right

1303
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,599
thank you jameson we have uh 10 minutes

1304
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
or so for a q a if anyone has any

1305
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
questions go ahead excellent we got one

1306
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,760
right here

1307
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,640
sure uh yes there is a babel rfc

1308
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,800
and the internet engineering task

1309
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
meeting which starts monday

1310
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
in the friday morning sessions they're

1311
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
going to be talking about babel whoa

1312
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,839
cool

1313
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,079
the other thing that one of the many

1314
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,960
other things you're going to be talking

1315
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,560
about is delay and disruption tolerant

1316
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
networking dtn you know

1317
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
oh right right kind of like email but

1318
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,480
not necessarily wondering whether you've

1319
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
looked at putting a dtn capability into

1320
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,720
this so when things may be down for

1321
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
hours at a stretch and then come back up

1322
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,680
you can still

1323
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,079
move things forward yeah yeah yeah

1324
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,359
absolutely yeah

1325
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,800
that's that's the other thing i meant to

1326
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
to mention is a lot of this stuff i

1327
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,040
don't know what i'm doing and i've been

1328
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,359
teaching myself this over over the years

1329
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,720
and stuff so i need to learn more about

1330
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,920
routing and stuff like that so if

1331
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,000
anybody has any suggestions of helping

1332
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,400
me with this i'm more than open to this

1333
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,079
because like i said i don't know what

1334
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:06,960
i'm doing

1335
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,280
one of the things i meant to say earlier

1336
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,520
too with the um the flow arts and

1337
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
juggling and stuff like this i think

1338
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,040
this crosses a lot over into our hacker

1339
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,280
community i dated a girl once that was

1340
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
big into the circus stuff and she told

1341
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,560
me that jugglers were the most

1342
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,359
hard-headed out of any of the the people

1343
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,040
because you have to start off failing

1344
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
you start off just by like dropping

1345
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,960
things on the ground and it's it's just

1346
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,400
uphill the whole time so you have to

1347
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,040
really have this like try and fail

1348
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
to keep trying kind of kind of attitude

1349
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
and not get too caught up with that or

1350
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,119
not have too much of your ego attached

1351
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
to the failing and know that phalange is

1352
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,119
part of the process to learn and get

1353
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,079
going further with that so um i would

1354
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,839
encourage everybody to to go out and

1355
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,720
learn not be afraid to to just try stuff

1356
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,400
and do stuff and that's how you go

1357
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
forward

1358
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,319
hmm

1359
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,160
i don't know man i kind of already don't

1360
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,598
follow the rules for those but

1361
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,359
yeah i don't know i'll get back to that

1362
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,160
yeah you're right that actually is one

1363
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,640
of the harder things because um

1364
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
talking to somebody that manages these

1365
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,400
buildings or own these buildings they're

1366
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
not like in my peer group you know these

1367
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
they own like properties and stuff so

1368
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,800
i've been going to people that i do know

1369
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
that i can just kind of talk to and be

1370
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,480
like hey can we do this and my one of my

1371
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,400
friends is a professional installer of

1372
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
things so he can actually drill through

1373
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,839
the walls and make really good like

1374
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,839
cable runs and stuff like that so what

1375
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,480
we're trying to do is get an example up

1376
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,079
and running to where it's actually

1377
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,599
working and then we can go and approach

1378
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,599
these other people and have an example

1379
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,520
and say look this is how it works this

1380
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,880
is what's going for

1381
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,839
and

1382
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,359
we're we we're talking to some of the

1383
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,520
local city government because they know

1384
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,640
about this stuff and they want to try to

1385
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,160
digitize the city and make it like a

1386
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
modern city to where they have um our

1387
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,839
city floods a lot and they want to make

1388
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,319
like little sensors to if the the

1389
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,599
streets flood so you could get like a

1390
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,359
text message to move your car real fast

1391
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,040
or something like that they don't know

1392
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,640
how to do that they tried with like

1393
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,599
lorawan but it's still not quite working

1394
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,599
so i want to make it look more

1395
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,880
professional and then like i said with

1396
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,559
the arden net that might make it look a

1397
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,160
little more professional so then i could

1398
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,400
approach them um

1399
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,920
one of the the things that i'm trying to

1400
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,040
do right now is the opera house downtown

1401
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
a lot of people working there that i

1402
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,920
know and they

1403
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
kind of are open to the idea of me doing

1404
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,119
that and i feel like there's going to be

1405
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,280
a tipping point where

1406
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,960
if a lot of people have it and a lot of

1407
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,240
like like

1408
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,440
professional people i don't know what

1409
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,640
the word is have it um it will look more

1410
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,240
authentic and then i could go to other

1411
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,839
people and be like look it's not just

1412
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,319
like me and my friends like putting up

1413
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,240
strings and tin cans or something like

1414
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,480
this is a real thing that's utilized by

1415
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,000
the city and if it actually has like

1416
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,599
real function and utility that other

1417
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,960
people can use

1418
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,359
they'll probably listen more but i'm

1419
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,720
still trying to figure that out like i

1420
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
said it's learn as you go kind of thing

1421
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,800
but um yeah

1422
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,559
all right

1423
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,240
whoever

1424
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,880
sure uh so uh

1425
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,359
last few years uh more and more we're

1426
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,119
seeing uh

1427
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,160
uh

1428
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,720
people shut down the internet on purpose

1429
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,599
right

1430
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,079
and i'd be curious uh i think actually

1431
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,960
indonesia is about to do it

1432
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,680
out of your vast experience of like

1433
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,440
alternative networking procedures what

1434
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,040
would be like the most

1435
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
like what's the best like deployable

1436
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,200
failover you know like if you wanted to

1437
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,319
kind of like

1438
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,839
take this and extend it in a way where

1439
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,599
like you could just like fly into a

1440
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,680
country that needed you know its own net

1441
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,559
or like whatever like that what

1442
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,760
right right so that's actually what i

1443
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
want to try to do is

1444
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,920
once this is all figured out and i get

1445
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,240
all the the kinks ironed out i want to

1446
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,480
make like an actual image and host that

1447
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,319
on there and then just say hey download

1448
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,720
this image stick it on a pie

1449
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,040
put an antenna up point it towards the

1450
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
network and it will just do its thing

1451
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,040
and connect and once that's like that i

1452
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,800
want to to just

1453
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
open this so then like you're saying it

1454
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,599
could be a village in the middle of

1455
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,280
nowhere like out of burning man or

1456
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,480
something they could just make their own

1457
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
networks that are not connected

1458
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,720
and because i'm still trying to build

1459
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,960
this out as it goes to figure out what

1460
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,160
we could actually use stuff like that

1461
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,200
for and that's why i was given the

1462
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
examples of like being able to back up

1463
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,359
wikipedia and host things on there for

1464
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,079
people but when i first started this

1465
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,800
that was kind of like a paranoid thought

1466
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,040
people thought i was kind of crazy like

1467
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,119
and then over the years like you said um

1468
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,359
like aws will go down this is not a

1469
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,440
replacement for amazon web services but

1470
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,599
uh that that's been going down more or

1471
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,920
like you said like political disruption

1472
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
or just the the state of the world right

1473
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,520
now it wasn't like that a few years ago

1474
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,559
so this

1475
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,559
actually has become more validating as

1476
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,480
i've been working on it that i it wasn't

1477
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,240
such a farce because i just felt like

1478
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,359
this dude

1479
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,240
on rooftops connecting things to nothing

1480
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,760
it felt really weird you know what i

1481
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,359
mean and you just have to kind of keep

1482
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,839
going forward and and trust in yourself

1483
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,559
that

1484
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,319
you're doing something and you believe

1485
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,520
in it and

1486
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,359
even if it doesn't go to that it's just

1487
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,359
like a fun local network that we can

1488
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,640
have and as long as you're just having

1489
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,319
fun with your friends i think that's one

1490
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,160
of the important things to not lose

1491
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,559
track of but by having fun you learn

1492
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,920
stuff and you build stuff that actually

1493
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,800
becomes useful to other people and then

1494
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,720
i'm just a single person i'm trying to

1495
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,559
create this so other people who are way

1496
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,800
smarter than me or have very specific

1497
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,760
specific task skills can add on to this

1498
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,839
and engineer to this so i feel like once

1499
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,440
you get those first three layers down

1500
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,200
that's like building roads and then

1501
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,960
everybody can drive on the roads and and

1502
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,559
do stuff and make stuff set up shops and

1503
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,920
things so

1504
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
i want to see where this goes

1505
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,160
by just like creating a blank canvas and

1506
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,000
letting people paint on it and stuff

1507
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
like that but i'm want to figure out

1508
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,440
like more utilities to scale it and

1509
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,720
stuff like that all right we've got time

1510
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,439
for one more question

1511
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,319
yeah that's what we've been actually

1512
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,680
looking at of like is there a

1513
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,839
distributed dns we're like no not really

1514
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,000
and then it gets back to like a central

1515
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,559
authority like you're saying and so

1516
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,960
yes as decentralized as it is you do

1517
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,920
have to have like a an authority of it

1518
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,440
so what i'm thinking is creating a

1519
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,440
website on the mesh net you could go on

1520
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,280
there and register your domain like you

1521
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,800
would on the real internet and just have

1522
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,240
like an authority there and then that

1523
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,440
would be your

1524
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,119
your thing

1525
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,720
it's one of those things that it's like

1526
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,079
when we get to that bridge that's what i

1527
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,920
want to cross kind of thing but that is

1528
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,760
an issue that i've been trying to figure

1529
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
out and like i said as i go through this

1530
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,200
i try to meet up with people that have

1531
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,760
very specific things to help

1532
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,599
show me what i should do to make this

1533
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,280
better and i just want to get more

1534
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,720
people interested and involved in it and

1535
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,240
once they do they'll start being able to

1536
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,800
help me with this but if anybody has any

1537
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,400
ideas or wants to talk about this more

1538
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,480
please come up to me i need to learn i

1539
