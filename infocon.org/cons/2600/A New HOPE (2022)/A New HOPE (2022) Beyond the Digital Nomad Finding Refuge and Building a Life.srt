00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
the pandemic

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
i myself

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,280
had to leave the us in 1999 uh because

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
i had a stalker who's talked me for

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
seven years

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
and it was getting more and more and

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
more dangerous and i just had to get the

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
frack out of here

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
uh and

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
aside from that i've lived and worked in

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
a bunch of different countries

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,720
even after it was safe for me to come

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
back here to the u.s

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,079
i've continued to work in different

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
places i worked for amazon in england

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
uh i've

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,600
spent i spent five ish years maybe a

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
little bit more than five years uh

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
working

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
traveling the world

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
and not even having an apartment here in

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
the u.s i would just go from

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
one work deployment to the next work

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
deployment

115
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
uh and then i'd hang out with friends

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
on their couches or in their spare

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,759
bedrooms for a week or two when i was

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,880
between

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,240
work projects

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
um

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,639
so

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
i am pretty stressed out about where

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
the u.s is going right now

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,960
as a lot of people are but i just want

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
to say that this talk is not

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
just for

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,479
people from the us or people with us

128
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,479
passports um

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
i like i said i've been working with

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,199
refugees from a lot of different

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
countries and

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
the tricks that i'm going to talk about

133
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
are

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,039
relevant to people of just about any

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,800
passport

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,479
i'm not going to say every passport

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,600
because i don't know everything about

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
every passport

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
i am not a lawyer

140
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,520
the stuff that i am sharing with you

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
is to me

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,000
basically life skills like i'm not an

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
expert because i've studied the law on

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
this

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,919
i am an expert because i've

146
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
just traveled a lot and helped a lot of

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
other people who also needed to travel

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
um often for

149
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
uh reasons of

150
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
safety and not just because they wanted

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
to work in another place

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,880
if you happen to be a person who just

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,360
wants to work in another place

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
this stuff will also help you

155
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
so bonus

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
uh yeah i just said all that

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
all right so let's talk about the

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
stories i grew up on

159
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,360
um

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
like i said i grew up around a lot of

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
holocaust survivors

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
i

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
went to private jewish schools

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
from pre-kindergarten all the way

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
through sixth grade

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
many of my teachers were

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,600
either themselves holocaust survivors or

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
the first generation

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,120
children of holocaust survivors

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
most of the people that my parents knew

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
were holocaust survivors

172
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
my family has been in the u.s

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
for many generations i was actually the

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
fifth generation born in oakland

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
california so that's kind of weird but

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
um

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
but the people i was around were people

178
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
who'd had to be refugees

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,160
um

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,000
and these are the things that i i heard

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
i heard people say over and over and

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
over again that top quote we saw the

183
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
writing on the wall

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,599
things were getting scarier and scarier

185
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
they were making more and more laws

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
against us

187
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
people were getting more and more

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
vicious towards us

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
um

190
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
another thing i heard a lot of was that

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,720
people's

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
parents

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
sent them off

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
to live with their cousins or live

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
sometimes even with strangers uh in the

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
us to get them away

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,720
other people would talk about how

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,120
a parent usually the father would come

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
here first and then as soon as they got

200
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
a job in an apartment they would send

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,960
for the rest of the family

202
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
i also heard about people who got their

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
passports too late

204
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,560
and couldn't get a visa to leave anymore

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,639
and then a lot of other families who

206
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
were like that who got stuck

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,039
ended up hiding in the house

208
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,080
of

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
a non-jewish family a christian family

210
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
some of the things that i've learned

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
from refugees are that

212
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
international laws that are supposed to

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
help refugees don't work well

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,560
um

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
a lot of people who have absolutely

216
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
verifiable reasons to request asylum

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
get to the country

218
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
this happens so much here in the united

219
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
states but it's not just a u.s problem

220
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
this is

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
every wealthy country in the world that

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,759
i have ever

223
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
been to and and dealt with

224
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
you know refugees trying to get help

225
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,199
i've seen this happen again and again

226
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,320
people

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,958
come with all this documentation

228
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,479
and the judges are like

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
nope not enough

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
or

231
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
it's it's not proof enough yeah maybe if

232
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
all that stuff really happened we'd let

233
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
you stay here but what you have isn't

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
good proof

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
um

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,839
and

237
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,040
i've learned that escaping

238
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
life-threatening danger is often a

239
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,080
choice of the lesser of two evils uh an

240
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880
example of this that is

241
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
not really here on the

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
on the page

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
is that

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,399
back in 1990 i'm sorry not 1990 what uh

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,399
201

246
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,800
2019 that's what i meant to say uh

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
trump was still the president i was down

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
in tijuana

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,680
and um i was helping all of these

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
different families

251
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
uh and hearing their stories and every

252
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
time i would hear what they were going

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
through

254
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
and

255
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
see that they were coming to the u.s and

256
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
and already feeling like the increased

257
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,600
pressure

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
on anybody of color

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
as well as a lot of people who had

260
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,959
different issues gay and trans people

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,720
that were escaping because of the

262
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
violence that was specific

263
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,640
specifically targeting them because they

264
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
were gay or trans and i was thinking

265
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
like why are you coming to the united

266
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
states like you're going

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
from the fire into a frying pan

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
and i mean yeah that's better than going

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,040
from the frying pan into the fire but

270
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
the frying pan still ain't a nice place

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
what are you doing this

272
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
and i learned from them

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
that you know a lot of times you just

274
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,640
have to pick the next safest place

275
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,200
and don't necessarily feel like this is

276
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
your end spot like if if you're going to

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
some place that's also bad

278
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
that may just be so that you're a little

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,399
bit safer right now so that you can get

280
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
to where you're going to be later where

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
you can actually make a life for

282
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
yourself

283
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
um

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,839
the

285
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,240
the third sub point there there are cats

286
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
in every country on earth

287
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,120
if you've never seen an american tale

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,279
it's a cartoon

289
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
from a very long time ago i didn't

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,279
actually look up what year it came out

291
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
um

292
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
but i think it's like a 30 year old

293
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
movie anyway it's a cartoon i highly

294
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
recommend it

295
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
uh

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,399
because

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,880
it will give you empathy for immigrants

298
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
in general but it's also a good thing to

299
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
think about if you

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
are ever going to be an immigrant

301
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,959
yourself uh the mice

302
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
in europe are saying

303
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
in america there are no cats but of

304
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
course they get to america and of course

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
there are cats

306
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
so just remember

307
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
if you are a mouse there are cats

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
everywhere on earth

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
you're not going to escape cats

310
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,160
completely wherever you go

311
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
um

312
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,720
and

313
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
the place that you most want to go

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
is possibly not your best option for

315
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
where to hop next

316
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
or where to hop first

317
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,279
um

318
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,160
another thing i've learned is that a lot

319
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,839
of people feel

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
weird about leaving their country

321
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,040
because they've left other people behind

322
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
that are in danger or especially if they

323
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
were activists they're like

324
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,360
i was i'm an activist i have to keep

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
fighting and it's like well you're going

326
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,839
to be able to fight more once you're

327
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,320
safe you won't be able to fight at all

328
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
if you're dead

329
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
and you're not going to be able to fight

330
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
much

331
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
if you're in jail

332
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,839
so

333
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,240
you can continue to do

334
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,079
the the things that are going to help

335
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
the people back home

336
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,519
once you are safe

337
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
and wherever you go

338
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
things where you land can be made better

339
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
so even if you can't necessarily help

340
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,839
the people

341
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,200
back home

342
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
you can do things to help people

343
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
wherever you find yourself now if that

344
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
is your bent

345
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
uh beware that survivor's got guilt is a

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
real thing

347
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
but there is help and there are many

348
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,519
practical ways to address it

349
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
so

350
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
a lot of people here in the united

351
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
states in particular

352
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
as every election comes up there's

353
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,639
people who are like if so and so gets

354
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,760
elected i'm moving to canada

355
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
and that's just dumb um

356
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
so like this isn't about i'm just

357
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
throwing a temper tantrum because

358
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
i don't

359
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,959
like

360
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,519
the last election or something like that

361
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
although obviously everything that's on

362
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
here if that's your deal

363
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
like you're also going to learn how to

364
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
get out of the united states if you just

365
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
feel that way um

366
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,959
but

367
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,920
i would say that you should stay

368
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
wherever you are whether that's the u.s

369
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
or whatever other country you're in if

370
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
you can do more good

371
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,639
by staying put

372
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
and you're not putting yourself at

373
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,199
such a risk that you're you're good

374
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
whatever good you could be doing is

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
going to be negated by

376
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
death mis dismemberment or you know

377
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
lifelong being in jail

378
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,030
um

379
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,360
[Music]

380
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,079
if you are going to put other vulnerable

381
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,440
people

382
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
at risk by leaving like

383
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
your elderly mother or your two-year-old

384
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
child that your ex has custody of

385
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,360
um that might be a good reason to stay

386
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,639
also

387
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,000
if all of the good people go away then

388
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
only the baddies stay

389
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
right so

390
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
so if you're not in a lot of danger

391
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,279
yourself and you are somebody who

392
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,199
is willing to help

393
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,320
push things in a positive direction

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,199
you know

395
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,600
stay put see what you can do

396
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
through

397
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
uh you know whether it's just through

398
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,480
voting or whether it's through much more

399
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
comprehensive

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
non-violent conflict

401
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
stay put

402
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,399
do those things

403
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
and if you have just generally enough

404
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,959
privilege to protect you

405
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
it might be better to just stay because

406
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,880
let me tell you

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,320
being an immigrant is hard

408
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,760
it doesn't matter

409
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
how much you already know the language

410
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
of the place that you're going to you

411
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,079
are going to experience culture shock

412
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,800
you may experience like a moment of

413
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,959
culture shock that seems

414
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
you know paralyzing

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,079
but

416
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
more to the point you're going to

417
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,120
experience lots of moments of culture

418
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
shock over the course especially of the

419
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
first year to two years that you're

420
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
living wherever you're living

421
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
and everything you have to navigate is

422
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,839
just very

423
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,560
difficult um

424
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,519
why you should go absolutely if you are

425
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
a member of a targeted group and are in

426
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,160
danger

427
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
um

428
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
not just right this minute

429
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,240
like you see the writing on the wall

430
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
they are coming after

431
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
people like you

432
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
already

433
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
so let's get out of here

434
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
um you're not able to help much by

435
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,839
staying put

436
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
the way that you're helping today is

437
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,399
already online remote

438
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,399
it the fact that you're physically

439
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
present is not the main thing that

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
you're doing

441
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
go ahead get out of here

442
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,199
um

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,880
if you realize that you could actually

444
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,079
help more by being in a safer place

445
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,839
get out of here

446
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
if you have vulnerable people that you

447
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
must protect

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
by getting them out of wherever you are

449
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,680
do that

450
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
a good example of this um

451
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,480
is right now

452
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
there are a lot of families in texas

453
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,759
who

454
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,320
have already just in the last couple of

455
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
months had to leave texas because of

456
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
the

457
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
uh

458
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,600
governor's order that any family with a

459
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
trans trans child

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
should be put under cps investigation

461
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
so the parents may be in a great

462
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,559
position personally but their family in

463
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,559
general is at risk and their kids are

464
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,959
definitely at risk so they need to get

465
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,400
out

466
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
at least of texas

467
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
all right so let's get down

468
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
to the thing that you actually came here

469
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
to find out how can i move abroad

470
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,480
so let's let's start

471
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,839
with like

472
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,520
the big thing do you have a hundred and

473
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
fifty thousand dollars

474
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,480
you win

475
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,440
you can literally buy citizenship for as

476
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,039
little as a hundred thousand dollars

477
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,720
investment plus legal fees in

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,360
saint lucia and antigua

479
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
and in barbuda

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,600
and then you will have a passport that

481
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,400
you can use to travel to 146 or 150

482
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
countries

483
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,720
uh

484
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
what's that word correspondingly um you

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
can also get a residence visa in denmark

486
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
with an investment of just a hundred

487
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
thousand euros

488
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
bolivia's investor visa requires a

489
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,679
thirty thousand dollar

490
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,280
uh us dollar investment and brazil

491
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
is just 40k

492
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
although

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
uh brazil which used to be

494
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,480
safer

495
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
for most of the people who are at most

496
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,799
risk in the u.s today is a little bit

497
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
less so so

498
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
you know

499
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
check where you're going

500
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
um

501
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,559
if you want to find out uh

502
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
whether the country that you're

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,039
interested in has an investor visa you'd

504
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
be surprised how many of them do just

505
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,360
look up country name investor visa

506
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,919
you're you're gonna get a lot of

507
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
lawyers that pop up with that

508
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
uh

509
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
do some research about those lawyers

510
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,960
before you reach out to any of them

511
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
um there is one

512
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
legal company that i've put the link

here to

514
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
it's not because i'm telling you that

515
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
they're great i don't know them

516
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
from adam i just know that they're

517
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,679
uh

518
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
they're well known and used a lot

519
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
how good they are i can't say one way or

520
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
the other because i've never interacted

521
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840
with them personally but they do have

522
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,039
on their website a very useful

523
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,360
handy-dandy pdf that you can request

524
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
from them

525
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,320
that will give you

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
a lot of information about

527
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
uh

528
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
moving to another country or getting a

529
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,000
citizenship through an investment visa

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,880
and

531
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,760
um

532
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,320
they and lots of other lawyers will

533
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
basically just take your money and make

534
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
everything happen for you

535
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
and there you go you've got your visa

536
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
you can go away yay

537
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,240
um

538
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
a lot of countries have something called

539
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,840
an immigration point system

540
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,600
now uh every country calls their

541
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
immigration point system something

542
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
different

543
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,120
but somewhere it'll say point system

544
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
the deal with this is that if you have

545
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
enough points

546
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
in their sort of matrix of things that

547
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,200
they want in immigrants

548
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,679
you just automatically get a residence

549
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,799
visa

550
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,960
so

551
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
look up your country that you're

552
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,400
interested in

553
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
find out if they have

554
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
some sort of points system and check to

555
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
see if you fit

556
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
you will be surprised sometimes you're

557
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
like well i definitely can't do this

558
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
because i don't have a bachelor's degree

559
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
and you have to have a bachelor's degree

560
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
to have enough points on these well you

561
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
might have something else that raises up

562
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
your points in another area

563
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
that will surprise you

564
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,039
so

565
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,400
don't just

566
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
think it's not going to happen

567
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
i'm going gonna come back to disabled

568
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
people a little bit and

569
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,240
later i wanna

570
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
like

571
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
right now just say a lot of times

572
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
disabled people will

573
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
not even look at immigrant

574
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,360
immigration point systems because they

575
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
think that their disability just

576
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,679
wipes them out no

577
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,720
check

578
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,000
check your points because you may have

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
enough points from other things that it

580
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
will overwhelm

581
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
whatever

582
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
points you've lost

583
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
for having a disability

584
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,159
um

585
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
for canada in particular

586
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,760
ex search for express entry

587
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
on their immigration website

588
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,880
and you'll be able to learn about their

589
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
immigration by point system by the way

590
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,720
they have uh province level ones and

591
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
they also have a federal level one and

592
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
the wording on it sounds a little bit

593
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
confusing at least to me it was when i

594
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
first learned about it i was like oh so

595
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,799
the federal ones are so you can get a

596
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,520
federal job no it's just like for the

597
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
whole country as opposed to just going

598
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
to one state so like if you happen to be

599
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
good at french

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
you can

601
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
get a

602
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,240
different kind of visa

603
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,880
uh through express entry with your

604
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,840
points

605
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,039
where they're counting the points

606
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,120
slightly differently specifically to go

607
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,559
to quebec

608
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,400
um so a thing to think about

609
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
vital skills get you visas now this is a

610
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
hacker conference uh and so there are a

611
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
lot of people here with very vital

612
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,360
skills uh

613
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
programmers

614
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,520
uh are

615
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
considered vital skills whether or not

616
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
you have a degree

617
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,039
however

618
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,919
however if you do not have a degree

619
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
even if you have a lot of years of

620
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
experience i highly recommend going out

621
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,559
and doing a bunch of certs

622
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
the certs that you're like

623
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,280
these are stupid

624
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
they have nothing to do with my job

625
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,799
um some of those certs are given

626
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,919
equivalence of a degree in some

627
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,080
countries an example of this

628
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,320
is the cissp cert if you happen

629
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
to qualify for that

630
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,200
that is considered a master's degree

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
in most of europe

632
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,320
i know

633
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
the laughter that's great um

634
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
[Laughter]

635
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,799
so

636
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,039
this is the one reason you should

637
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,000
definitely get certs

638
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
the netherlands is one country that has

639
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
special programs to help reduce the cost

640
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
of migrating there

641
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
if you have computer skills whether it's

642
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
programming i.t infosec

643
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
they've also got a whole bunch of other

644
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,039
uh

645
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
specific areas

646
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
of interest that they're that they're

647
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,840
looking for so check their immigration

648
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,039
websites

649
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,159
for what other kinds of vital skills new

650
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,360
zealand

651
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,080
has a specific site for

652
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,600
immigration to fill skills shortages

653
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
skillsshortages.immigration.gov.nz

654
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,799
and of course

655
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
i think most of the people in this room

656
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
probably could get

657
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,799
a skills shortage

658
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,360
visa because you'd be surprised the the

659
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
number of different things

660
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,159
that are on that list

661
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
so

662
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,880
i did not see an age limit on the new

663
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
zealand one some countries have age

664
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,679
limits and some don't because as long as

665
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,960
you're willing to

666
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,320
guarantee that you're going to work for

667
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
a certain amount of time

668
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,919
they don't care like it's about

669
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,200
guaranteeing that you're going to work a

670
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
certain amount of time

671
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,799
um so and that by the way

672
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,559
like

673
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
this is for residency

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
getting a work visa

675
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,559
like you can be

676
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,640
65 or 75 if you've got a job

677
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,000
you can still get the work visa so

678
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,799
um

679
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,480
and that's the next slide um

680
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
so

681
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,279
if you want to get a job

682
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,240
uh so that you can get a visa you will

683
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
find that it's a little bit difficult a

684
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
lot of people

685
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
a lot of places

686
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
say that they want people they even want

687
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,840
foreign employees

688
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
but they want you physically

689
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,559
local for them to interview face to face

690
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,600
before

691
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,279
they'll make a decision

692
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,600
but that is changing more and more

693
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
especially with

694
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,159
uh

695
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
people getting more used to remote

696
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
remote learning remote work

697
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,400
so

698
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
network online to meet people

699
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
in your field in your target country and

700
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
i keep talking about target country

701
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
uh for some people

702
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
it's best to sort of

703
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
when you first start out pick several

704
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,039
different countries and you know then as

705
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,039
things start to come together then you

706
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,480
narrow down and say okay i'm going for

707
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,279
this one um but if you've already got a

708
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,640
pretty good idea that you're gonna get

709
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,159
one place then that's your target

710
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,360
country

711
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
so

712
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
attend a conference in your target

713
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,440
country that's a great way to get to

714
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,799
speak to people

715
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,360
also to get to travel there and

716
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
look around and see what it's like and

717
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,120
it will also give you an opportunity to

718
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,559
apply to jobs and then go to the job

719
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
interviews during the time that you're

720
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,120
traveling to the country for that

721
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
conference

722
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
you can also go on a tourist visa just

723
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
randomly

724
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,039
and look for jobs while you're there

725
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,080
you can apply to jobs online and there

726
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,200
are a couple of websites up here uh

727
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,120
relocateme.edu

728
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
and we are developers.com

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,640
countries that they are not presently in

731
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,520
um

732
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
you can also if you happen to work for a

733
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,880
big company that has offices overseas

735
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
company you already work

736
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,000
uh for

737
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,039
they will generally uh if if they're

738
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
going to transfer you

739
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
they will generally take care of your

740
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,520
work visa for getting over there once

741
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,679
you get over there if you're like i

742
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,080
actually want to ditch this country then

743
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,159
you get to work or ditch this country

744
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,720
ditch this company uh then while you're

745
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
settled in and and working

746
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
at your job in the new country you can

747
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
start looking for

748
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
whatever the next job is and then you

749
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,679
can transfer your work visa to your new

750
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,000
job

751
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,480
all right family ties

752
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
do you have any close family living in

753
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
another country they may be able to

754
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
sponsor you

755
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
this is also a good one for people who

756
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
know that they are not going to be able

757
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,200
to work

758
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,919
at all or much longer your family may be

759
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,880
able to

760
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
sponsor you anyway

761
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
uh

762
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
family ties part two

763
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,399
was one of your parents or grandparents

764
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
an immigrant to the country where you

765
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
live now

766
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
look up the immigration rules for the

767
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,480
countries that each of your grandparents

768
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
and or parents was born in

769
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,720
because many countries have repatriation

770
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
immigration and

771
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
that repatriation immigration will

772
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,559
sometimes come with basically an

773
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
automatic passport so you're a citizen

774
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,200
from day one

775
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,919
and sometimes that repatriation involves

776
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,159
getting a residence visa and then after

777
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,320
you've been there for two years four

778
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,760
years five years whatever their rules

779
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,840
are then you get your

780
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,480
uh passport

781
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,440
family ties part three making aliyah

782
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
moving to israel if you are jewish

783
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
um

784
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
you can move to israel that's what i did

785
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
um

786
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
now

787
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,279
i know that some people are

788
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,000
howling at horror at the thought of

789
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
moving to israel

790
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
because of the way that you feel

791
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,440
politically about israel as a country

792
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,159
but i would like those of you who are

793
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,039
leftists like me and who believe that

794
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,000
palestinians deserve a country like i do

795
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
that you can do more good for the

796
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480
palestinians while you're living in

797
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,799
israel and voting in israel in fact

798
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,600
believe it or not you can vote for arab

799
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,159
parties in the israeli parliament

800
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,080
if that's your deal

801
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
you can't do that

802
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,279
from the u.s

803
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,080
with your american passport uh you can

804
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
also do a lot more on the ground

805
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
activism and work and things that are

806
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,720
going to be beneficial to people

807
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,559
way more beneficial than holding up a

808
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
sign at a protest

809
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,600
so

810
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,000
even if that is your political

811
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
stand

812
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,679
there are still good reasons good things

813
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,360
to do while you're on the ground in

814
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
israel and that israeli passport

815
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
will give you privileges that your u.s

816
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
passport doesn't give you

817
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:02,640
so

818
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,520
some years back i was able to

819
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,559
work

820
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,000
in europe without a work visa

821
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,919
now if i was going there on my us

822
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
passport

823
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
i would not have been able to do that i

824
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,840
would have had to have gotten a work

825
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
visa but because i had an israeli

826
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,320
passport i could work

827
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,080
in europe in this case in france for six

828
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
months

829
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,840
without getting a visa so it's like a

830
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
tourist visa waiver but it's like a work

831
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,240
visa waiver so you can't do that on a us

832
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,760
passport and that like i said before

833
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,159
you may be taking your first hop to

834
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,320
something that gets you safe

835
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,799
and then using that as the tool to do

836
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,158
the other things that you're going to do

837
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,279
oh by the way did you know

838
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,399
if you are

839
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,760
hispanic

840
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
or

841
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
latinx i guess portuguese descendant is

842
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,480
latinx and not hispanic if you can trace

843
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
your ancestry back to somebody who was

844
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
expelled from spain or portugal you may

845
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,720
have a route to instant citizenship in

846
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,559
portugal

847
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,200
there was there was an immigration law

848
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,600
for spain but that has

849
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,720
ended

850
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
um however the program in portugal is

851
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
ongoing

852
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,919
so

853
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,200
um if you happen to be hispanic and you

854
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,039
know nothing

855
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,519
of your family's history

856
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,080
start out by looking up your last name

857
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,720
and see if it's likely to be a safari

858
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
last name you would be surprised

859
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,360
hernandez martinez

860
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
um

861
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,279
then start doing some research

862
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,840
working your way up the family tree keep

863
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,000
following the spanish line up the family

864
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
tree or the portuguese line up your

865
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,519
family tree and see if you can find the

866
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,440
person who left

867
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
the iberian peninsula

868
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,240
because they were expelled and if they

869
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,760
happened to be jewish then

870
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,840
you might be able to get that passport

871
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,039
all right

872
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,559
marriage

873
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,240
is what brings us together today

874
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,799
getting married for a visa is generally

875
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,000
a terrible idea don't do it

876
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,399
uh you are more vulnerable to domestic

877
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,399
violence if your visa is based on

878
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,440
marriage

879
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,240
and if you are caught having a marriage

880
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,919
of convenience you get deported

881
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,120
and you're going to get deported from

882
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,240
the country that you came from not to

883
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,799
the country that you want to go to next

884
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,600
so

885
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,159
um don't do that as a matter of

886
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,200
convenience however if you do happen to

887
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,279
actually be in love with somebody who

888
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,840
happens to have citizenship in another

889
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,080
country and maybe you've been living

890
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,399
together for the last three years and

891
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,880
you guys both hate marriage think it's a

892
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
stupid thing get married and

893
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
then you guys can go both live in the

894
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,440
place that's safer for you if that place

895
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,880
happens to be safer also they may have a

896
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,760
passport which gives you both

897
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,000
opportunities to live in other places

898
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,240
that the passport that you have

899
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
doesn't allow you

900
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,640
all right migrating as a disabled person

901
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
it is not easy but it is not impossible

902
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,600
when people tell you that no country

903
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,440
will take a disabled immigrant they are

904
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
flat wrong in fact if you look up

905
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
uh

906
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,399
disabled immigrants eu you will find

907
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,760
that the eu government actually is very

908
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,080
concerned about the fact that disabled

909
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
immigrants are falling through the

910
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
cracks and they need to do more to

911
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,360
uh reach out to them and make sure that

912
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,799
they're getting the services that they

913
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,200
need they wouldn't have to have that if

914
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
they didn't have disabled immigrants

915
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,480
right

916
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,039
okay you will definitely need to do

917
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,039
extra research to make sure that the

918
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
accessibility that you need is available

919
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
to you

920
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,200
um but you can do it

921
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,519
i've put a couple of links here by the

922
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,280
way uh after this talk uh or anytime

923
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,159
really you can go on the wiki and if you

924
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,599
just look up

925
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,800
um

926
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
be just like type into the search on the

927
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
wiki beyond

928
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,879
beyond the digital nomad you'll find

929
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,239
all of these slides on the wiki

930
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,839
so you can click through the links

931
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,399
all right migrating as a trans person

932
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,879
there's a three-part problem can you get

933
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,239
a visa

934
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,639
is it safe where you're going and will

935
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,839
you be able to get health care

936
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,599
continuity

937
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
um

938
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,879
i guess

939
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,960
all of these are also issues for

940
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
disabled people especially the

941
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,800
healthcare continuity one of the things

942
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
that helps

943
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,079
in both of those cases is to network

944
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,280
with people

945
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,000
who are like you in the country that you

946
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
are thinking of moving to

947
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,320
because they will help you to navigate

948
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
all of the vagaries of the system where

949
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,440
you're going

950
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,240
there is an org that can help you

951
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
transrescue.org

952
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,160
they have added the united states the uk

953
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,000
and brazil to the countries that they

954
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,680
will help people get out of

955
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,359
then

956
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,560
there's the nomadic escape hatch

957
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
let's say you've gone through all of

958
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
these things you've done all of your

959
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,480
research you've tried all the different

960
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,400
angles and you still can't get a work

961
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,200
visa or a residence visa

962
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,079
but you want to get out now

963
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,400
you might be able to manage the nomadic

964
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
life for a while

965
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,400
stay in any country as long as your

966
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,640
tourist visa or visa waiver allows you

967
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,599
to

968
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,359
move to another country when your visa

969
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,160
is up at least for the minimum required

970
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
time before you return to the country

971
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,079
you were just in

972
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,359
what you're going to need to be able to

973
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,960
do that you're going to need a source of

974
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,839
income from some kind of remote work or

975
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,000
freelancing

976
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,320
depending on where you're living you can

977
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,920
get by with a very small income and

978
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
since you're only traveling on tourist

979
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
visas

980
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
most places aren't actually looking at

981
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
your income

982
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,599
back in the 80s when i used to travel

983
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,520
i'd actually have to bring

984
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
um proof of like my bank statements

985
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
showing that i had income for a certain

986
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,200
number of months

987
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,160
i haven't experienced that at all

988
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
since 2000. i can't think of a single

989
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,800
time that i've been asked to prove that

990
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,760
i have money anywhere just to travel on

991
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
tourist visas or visa waivers

992
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
you will need a permanent address in the

993
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,359
country where your passport is from

994
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,480
i

995
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
did not have a permanent address in the

996
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
united states for a long time as i think

997
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,079
i mentioned earlier um

998
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,040
and

999
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,440
that got me in a little bit of trouble a

1000
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,480
couple of times so what i ended up doing

1001
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,240
was asking a friend to let me use their

1002
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,359
address

1003
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,800
and then once i had an address even

1004
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,040
though i never stepped foot in that

1005
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,160
address

1006
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,040
uh

1007
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
whatever

1008
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,839
move right along you can come into the

1009
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,400
country

1010
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
you need to have a lot of flexibility

1011
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
you're going to experience different

1012
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
living country different living

1013
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
conditions

1014
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
new cultures all kinds of bumps in the

1015
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,640
road

1016
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
you need to have a really good sense of

1017
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
humor because this is not for the faint

1018
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,400
of heart this nomadic escape hatch i was

1019
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,160
explaining earlier

1020
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,400
that uh

1021
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
that this is basically

1022
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
really an option for people who already

1023
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,680
have ptsd

1024
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,400
because if you already have ptsd you're

1025
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
always going to be thinking about three

1026
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,119
or four different alternate plans for if

1027
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,800
this thing goes wrong then i'll do this

1028
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,320
but if that goes wrong then i'll do this

1029
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,280
other thing

1030
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,240
and and so every time a bump along the

1031
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
road hits you've already got like six

1032
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,119
different backup plans um

1033
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
if you try to do this and you do not

1034
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,720
already have ptsd uh

1035
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,800
maybe sit down and spend some time with

1036
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,599
some people who over plan for things

1037
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,240
because that will help you with your

1038
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,680
flexibility

1039
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,839
really

1040
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,200
um

1041
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,040
remember europe is not the only

1042
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
continent

1043
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,839
a historic note here many families

1044
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
escaping the holocaust moved to

1045
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,800
argentina brazil chile and other latin

1046
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,040
american countries if they couldn't get

1047
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,560
into the u.s

1048
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,920
um

1049
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,760
and many of those families did quite

1050
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
well

1051
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,119
in the countries that they landed in

1052
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,920
so

1053
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
uh you don't have to worry about what's

1054
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
going to happen three generations from

1055
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
now three generations from now your kids

1056
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,720
are going to have to your

1057
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,200
great-great-grandchildren are going to

1058
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,640
have to make their own decision about

1059
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
where they live

1060
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
right now you have to worry about you

1061
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,680
and your family

1062
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,800
today

1063
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
um

1064
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,839
do your research network with people

1065
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,160
before you go to wherever you're going

1066
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,800
if at all possible visit first before

1067
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,440
you make your permanent move

1068
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
or at least

1069
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,599
on that first visit on that first trip

1070
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,680
if you are going and you've left

1071
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,480
everything behind uh have a return

1072
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,440
ticket so that you can come back

1073
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
uh

1074
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,839
quickly if you're like oh no this was a

1075
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,160
bad idea

1076
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,079
uh all right

1077
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,640
any questions

1078
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
back there in the blue shirt

1079
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,400
um so

1080
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,440
if you are working not for

1081
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,560
an employer in that same country

1082
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,119
that's fine

1083
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,680
remote work for so like if you're

1084
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,520
working for a con for a company in the

1085
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,200
united states

1086
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
and

1087
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
your butt is sat in

1088
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
france or thailand or whatever

1089
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
they don't they don't care what they're

1090
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
worried about is you taking

1091
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,119
local jobs without having the

1092
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,839
appropriate visa

1093
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,119
okay so

1094
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,160
um

1095
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,880
uh the this question was where do you

1096
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,680
pay tax while you're moving around like

1097
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,480
this so as a us citizen you're going to

1098
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,640
have to pay taxes in the u.s whether you

1099
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,119
live in the u.s or not unless you give

1100
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,400
up your u.s citizenship

1101
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,119
it's kind of annoying trying to you know

1102
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,960
deal with the tax returns at the end of

1103
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
the year for for the u.s in those

1104
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
situations um but generally speaking

1105
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
you're going to have to pay tax in the

1106
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,240
country that you're

1107
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
actually working in usually like not

1108
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,800
actually working in like your butt is

1109
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
sat there but where your employer is

1110
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
from

1111
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
um if you're doing

1112
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,119
uh freelance work

1113
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,240
and you're

1114
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,880
not in the country as a resident not in

1115
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,960
the country as a citizen not in the

1116
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,520
country on a work visa

1117
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,240
then generally speaking

1118
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,960
your income is kind of irrelevant to

1119
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,760
them except that you're

1120
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,720
not

1121
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,560
pulling on their resources right so

1122
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,480
you're gonna pay taxes

1123
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,599
uh

1124
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,599
usually in the place where your

1125
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,560
passport is from uh again

1126
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
this is depending on where your passport

1127
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
is from and where you're living

1128
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,240
tax rules are going to be different so

1129
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,839
i'm i'm also not a tax accountant in any

1130
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,240
country

1131
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,480
but yeah generally generally speaking

1132
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
i've always paid taxes in the country

1133
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,359
where my employer was if i had like an

1134
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,839
employer

1135
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,839
yes

1136
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,480
when i was going um work because i had

1137
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,000
to prove that like nobody else could do

1138
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
my job in the eu is that still a

1139
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
requirement

1140
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,079
so um the question is uh

1141
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,359
it

1142
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
the in the situation that he's talking

1143
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,680
about uh he had to prove that nobody

1144
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,640
else in the eu could do his job

1145
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,079
now

1146
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,680
i know that under some visas you do have

1147
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
to you know

1148
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,119
do that to prove that nobody else could

1149
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,240
do your job uh but i think that there's

1150
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,119
more of an openness right now to realize

1151
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,760
that it's not so much that nobody in the

1152
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,319
whole country can do this one job

1153
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,920
but that in general the country needs

1154
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,280
more people

1155
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,560
that fit that job role and so they're

1156
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,079
hiring people in

1157
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,079
you know for the skill

1158
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,119
set

1159
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,240
rather than

1160
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,560
this one job but

1161
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,160
when it comes to work visas that are

1162
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,920
attached to a specific country and a

1163
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,440
specific job

1164
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,640
um

1165
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
yes sometimes

1166
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,319
the the way that it's set up in the way

1167
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,560
that it's worded is like are you hiring

1168
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,319
this person because they're the only

1169
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,240
person in the whole wide world who could

1170
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
do this job

1171
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,640
and

1172
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,480
you don't you personally don't have to

1173
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
worry about that the company that's

1174
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
hiring you and their lawyers they get to

1175
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
deal with that

1176
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
yes

1177
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,599
so he was just asking are there

1178
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,640
additional

1179
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,560
challenges with traveling with family

1180
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,400
with kids uh

1181
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,960
he has some prior knowledge i traveled

1182
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,440
with my three children

1183
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,720
uh

1184
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,880
all of those travels all of those things

1185
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,040
i just described yes

1186
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
mostly as a single parent though not

1187
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,319
entirely um so

1188
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,480
one of the challenges is different

1189
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,200
school systems in all the different

1190
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
places so

1191
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,319
um you're gonna have to make some

1192
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,599
decisions

1193
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,920
uh find out everything you can about the

1194
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,319
the schools where you're going to

1195
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,359
um

1196
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,680
so one thing i didn't explain

1197
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,599
uh earlier so

1198
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,800
i have three kids um that the oldest and

1199
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,319
the youngest always homeschooled um

1200
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,040
from

1201
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,480
from 1999 on i homeschooled them

1202
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,680
because uh it was just easier but my

1203
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,119
middle kid

1204
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,839
is so stubborn i have no idea where she

1205
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,680
gets her stubbornness from no idea

1206
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,520
whatsoever

1207
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,240
but she wanted to go to public schools

1208
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,560
specifically public school wherever we

1209
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,520
went

1210
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,079
now this girl she went to school in

1211
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,400
english she went to school in spanish

1212
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
she went to school in hebrew she

1213
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,480
actually had to do matriculation exams

1214
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,520
which is like

1215
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,440
high school graduation exams in hebrew

1216
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,240
the year that she arrived in israel

1217
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,599
because

1218
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,800
um

1219
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,599
technically it had been too many years

1220
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,880
since she got her citizenship and so she

1221
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,760
no longer qualified to be able to do

1222
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,520
uh

1223
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,720
to be able to do this in english

1224
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
so yeah that's

1225
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,480
that is going to be a challenge getting

1226
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,839
your kids uh settled into schools

1227
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,079
basically if the adults can get a visa

1228
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,200
the kids can come along generally your

1229
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
your kids under the age of 18 in some

1230
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,079
cases under the ages of 21 or 24

1231
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,079
depending on the country will be able to

1232
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,040
follow you as long as you get a visa

1233
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
and in many cases

1234
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,319
but not all

1235
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,040
if one spouse gets a visa the other

1236
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,760
spouse gets a tag along visa although

1237
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,599
the second spouse may or may not be

1238
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,040
allowed to work

1239
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,040
so that is totally dependent on the

1240
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,640
country and the kind of visa that you

1241
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,319
have and a bunch of other

1242
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,880
vagaries

1243
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,880
all right we have one question from

1244
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,359
natrix chat

1245
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,040
krabby pants asked could you talk a

1246
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
little about having to give up u.s

1247
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,880
citizenship if you acquire citizenship

1248
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,720
elsewhere

1249
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,119
okay so there are some countries uh

1250
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,240
where

1251
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,400
if you take their citizenship

1252
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
you have to give up whatever citizenship

1253
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,480
you had before the us is one of those

1254
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,359
countries uh if you

1255
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,800
you know say you were a guatemalan

1256
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,599
citizen previously and now you want u.s

1257
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,839
citizenship you have to give up your

1258
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,000
guatemalan citizenship in order to take

1259
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,319
your u.s citizenship

1260
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,319
however

1261
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,880
there are many countries that don't care

1262
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,800
they don't care how many citizenships

1263
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,119
you have so you don't have to give up

1264
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,920
anything now the u.s

1265
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,520
does not

1266
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,359
um

1267
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,720
they don't recognize other citizenships

1268
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,839
so i have two citizenships each of my

1269
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,880
children has three citizenships

1270
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,160
when any of us is in the united states

1271
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,280
uh

1272
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,880
we're just u.s citizens as far as the

1273
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,440
u.s government is concerned they

1274
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,480
care not about anything else right you

1275
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,880
can't come into the u.s

1276
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,200
on a different passport if you are a u.s

1277
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,680
citizen

1278
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,599
now

1279
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,079
if you are a u.s citizen and you get

1280
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,040
another

1281
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
passport after

1282
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,119
being a u.s citizen

1283
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,440
and if that country doesn't care

1284
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,960
you don't have to give up your u.s

1285
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,880
citizenship like the u.s is not

1286
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
demanding that you give up your u.s

1287
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,319
citizenship because you got

1288
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,480
danish citizenship i believe

1289
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
denmark requires you to give up your u.s

1290
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,640
citizenship or any other citizenship in

1291
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,000
order to get

1292
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,960
a danish passport but say

1293
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,920
i don't know

1294
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,720
uh brazil i think doesn't care um uh i

1295
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,440
know the uk doesn't care so if you get

1296
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,839
your uk citizenship you can still keep

1297
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,880
your

1298
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
uh

1299
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,200
israeli or turkish or u.s passport like

1300
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,480
they don't care

1301
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
so it just depends

1302
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,280
yes

1303
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,520
i don't know if they still do this but

1304
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,280
i'm aware of situations where an

1305
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,480
american

1306
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
married a foreigner

1307
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,359
and she acquired

1308
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,319
her citizenship in america and the

1309
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,240
american authorities told her she had to

1310
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,559
renounce her previous citizenship that's

1311
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,440
right they were trying to trick her it's

1312
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,920
not the rule

1313
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,240
it's not the rule you're saying that's

1314
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
that's there you cannot force someone

1315
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
to renounce their foreign relationship

1316
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
although you might try to deceive them

1317
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,119
into doing so and they actually have a

1318
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,520
policy of deceiving you so

1319
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,319
this is this is interesting information

1320
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,119
so

1321
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,599
uh the gentleman over here is saying

1322
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,520
that um

1323
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,400
first off he said that somebody he knew

1324
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,359
uh

1325
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,280
his wife

1326
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,760
was going to get u.s citizenship and

1327
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,359
they told her that she had to renounce

1328
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,520
her u.s citizenship her

1329
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,280
other foreign citizenship in order to

1330
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,839
get her u.s citizenship that is what i

1331
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
have seen again and again and again

1332
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,280
and he says

1333
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,200
they are deceiving

1334
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,760
the immigrant they can't the rule is

1335
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,680
that they can't actually force the

1336
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,839
immigrant to give up their other

1337
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,680
citizenship

1338
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,200
um

1339
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,960
sorry

1340
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,400
i should have turned off the going to

1341
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,599
sleep part my bad um

1342
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,720
so that that it is not true that they

1343
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
can't force you to give up your other

1344
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,359
citizenship so

1345
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,200
i don't know um

1346
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,079
i i would say ask an immigration lawyer

1347
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,559
if you're in a situation like that but

1348
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,440
um

1349
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,359
oh one other thing about giving up your

1350
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,359
u.s citizenship um there are

1351
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,240
good

1352
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,000
valid reasons to give up your u.s

1353
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,400
citizenship if you are outside of the

1354
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,119
country uh even if you do plan to come

1355
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,119
back here to visit someday

1356
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,880
uh but

1357
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,240
be aware

1358
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,119
that they can be fickle about that there

1359
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,119
have been periods

1360
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,400
in our

1361
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,440
in our history as in in my lifetime not

1362
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,079
as in the far back history in which if

1363
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,839
you gave up your u.s citizenship you

1364
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,200
were not allowed to come back into the

1365
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,359
country for 10 years

1366
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,440
uh so i don't believe that they are

1367
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,599
doing that right now but it has been a

1368
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,319
thing in the past uh so make sure that

1369
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,839
if you are giving up your u.s

1370
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,079
citizenship for any reason

1371
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,599
uh that you

1372
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,440
talk to a competent council of some sort

1373
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,359
to find out what that's going to mean

1374
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,400
for you

1375
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
if there's some reason why you need to

1376
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,440
come back to the us

1377
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,359
any other questions

1378
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,119
okay so we're almost done for time so

1379
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,520
i'm gonna take the

1380
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,160
uh black and green back there first and

1381
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,280
if we've still got time i'll get you

1382
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,280
again

1383
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,280
so um i think that the best place to go

1384
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,800
for those answers would actually be

1385
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
transrescue.org

1386
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,079
um because they they actually have the

1387
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,599
list of all of that for all the

1388
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,000
countries uh and it's it's gonna be

1389
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,040
different

1390
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,880
and some places very wonky in some

1391
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,880
places super easy like oh yes it makes

1392
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,559
sense

1393
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,640
moving right along whatever right and

1394
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,040
other places are gonna be like

1395
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,079
you know let's have your your dna and

1396
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,680
your firstborn even if you're never

1397
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,319
going to have children

1398
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,720
okay all right we are out of time i

1399
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,800

go ahead and ask out in the hallway or

1402
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,920
enter it into the matrix chat so that

1403
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,200
the matrix chat will persist for the

1404
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,720
rest of the conference and beyond so you

1405
