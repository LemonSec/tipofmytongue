like during the um right in the middle

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,840
of the pandemic um so

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,119
um so

18
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
i i normally work with their researchers

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
um from technical universities um mainly

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
in the field of supply chain and

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
logistics and um as an artist and

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
researcher um so um i'm gonna start my

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
uh presentation

24
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,040
um

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
so um the um

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
how it started basically sort of um a

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
friend of mine who worked for this small

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
municipality in japan i'm originally

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
from japan by the way um

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
um called minami saniku um

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,200
made contact with me so um this place is

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,360
um basically like known as a

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,479
disaster area uh from the

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,680
2011 tsunami so it's been like um more

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
than a decade uh since the um incident

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
however um the um yeah was still there

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
um suffering from some financial issues

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
and stuff like that and he basically um

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
run this new project out called the

40
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
chevron residence saniku so where he

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,080
invited um some um more or less more

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
experimental chefs from um abroad and so

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
that kind of they stayed in this region

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
trying to come up with

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
new recipes

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
by fusing their expertise and local

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,840
cuisine

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
and so there are the first edition was

49
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
successful and they're

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
running the second one with chefs from

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
taiwan um well

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
sadly um you know this got cancelled and

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
like everything else um

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
during the pandemic um so he made

55
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
contact with me basically asking me so

56
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,599
what should we

57
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,399
do with the budget

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
so um i actually

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
was in this place in 2019 summer before

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
the pandemic started and this was

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
in this one of the coffee places in the

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
middle of the mountain and

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
i was kind of expected to see um some

64
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,400
some sort of physical traces from the

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,519
disaster

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,480
um

67
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
but for some reason i really couldn't

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
see much of that much of it like um so

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
the in terms of like you know the

70
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,400
um

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
you know infrastructure and stuff like

72
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
that so it's everything it's been has

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,640
been already fixed really well um

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
so but um but what i could just what i

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
could see was more more or less i would

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
say like a financial like traces

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,480
um what i mean is that um you know you

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
see you go to this like a local

79
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
community center or like a library in

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,840
those places and those

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
buildings are

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
made just kind of too well for this kind

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,959
of uh

84
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
with sort of for this before place with

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,799
this kind of population so they have

86
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
like about 10 000 people there and then

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
they have this like

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
this library building that's made with

89
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
this huge wood and some really large

90
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,599
glasses and kind of stuff that's kind of

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
you can kind of see the cost of it like

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
without even just

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,519
you know thinking much about it and then

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
sort of this like sort of the financial

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
traces i mean they've kind of this kind

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
of reflects the magnitude of the

97
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
disaster in this region so basically the

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
sort of the amount of the number of

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,520
lives lost in this region sort of

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
is

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
reflected in this kind of way so

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
basically financially sort of trying to

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
compensate for the lives that they um

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,320
lost

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
so if you observe this region from above

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
um it's uh it's c-shaped um roughly and

107
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,520
it's this municipality is located in the

108
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,479
um

109
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,120
northeast of japan and facing the

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
pacific ocean towards the east and

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
what's special about this region is that

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,759
the

113
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
the they have all the

114
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
water catchment areas

115
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
within the municipality itself so it

116
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
means that sort of when um

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
water circulates from the forest

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,479
um to the sea and it goes back to this

119
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
forest again so basically sort of they

120
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,639
can sort of manage the entire ecosystem

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
um within their own region sort of um so

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
um and also like the other thing that's

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
and that i learned um

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
is that because of the what when when

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
tsunami hits basically sort of it

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
um it comes and then sort of it

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
goes back into the sort of

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
ocean again so that sort of the um

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
not only that it carries like all the

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,639
stuff from this place uh from from the

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
town and stuff but also all the

132
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,039
pollution in the um

133
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
ocean itself so they actually the ocean

134
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
got much

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
much cleaner that the yield rate of of

136
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
all the uh

137
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
aquaculture got much more improved and

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
stuff like that so it's some interesting

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,919
stuff that i learned about

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
so around this time like i started to

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
hear some um um some term like zoom

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,919
fatigue and

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,720
some some you know like people some

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
demand for like a new kind of virtual

145
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,479
physical space so um so and then uh one

146
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,199
of the attempts that's like don was the

147
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
um this london marathon that was held

148
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
virtually um which i participated in uh

149
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
personally myself as well and uh so um

150
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
basically what they did was to um

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
they made this app and so if you um you

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
have to pay for it but you get

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
registered and you download the app and

154
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
sort of on this day of the marathon you

155
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,560
basically have to um

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,840
sort of um

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,680
were either sort of run the walk um the

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,759
26.2 miles within uh

159
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,400
24 hours so um

160
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
the reason why i participated is that

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
you can basically sort of take as much

162
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,759
rest as you want um in the course of the

163
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
with the marathon so um so because the

164
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
finishing time is like nine hours and

165
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
five minutes

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
so um i would be i would normally like

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
in a normal marathon i wouldn't

168
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
participate because i'll be too ashamed

169
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
to be walking in front of people at all

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,960
times um so um basically yeah

171
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
so what it was technically was the

172
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
audio based augmented reality experience

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
so what it means is that um um so

174
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
basically sort of every mile you make

175
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
you get like announcements through the

176
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,520
um the app and that says oh oh

177
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
you just made a one mile or whatever you

178
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
know and then just they basically tell

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
you uh where you where you would be sort

180
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
of running

181
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,800
in london um the if you were physically

182
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
there um so of course like you're

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
running in your own town so in my case i

184
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
was running in rotterdam and uh you know

185
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,400
sort of kind of you as you see these

186
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
sort of scenes uh from the your own town

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,599
then you kind of hear this um

188
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
overlay a sound overlay of you know this

189
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
sort of the other city so it's kind of a

190
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
overlapped overlap there

191
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,479
um

192
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
this reminds me of uh

193
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,199
this uh science science fiction novel um

194
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,240
by

195
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
chyna muirville

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
who is

197
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
the um

198
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
he's his british person um

199
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
so basically this novel the called city

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,719
and city

201
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,440
where

202
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,839
two city-states

203
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,799
coexist and at the same time in the same

204
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
geographical area

205
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
um so this is basically where this is

206
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,160
where the novo is based in um

207
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,040
and so you know these protagonists like

208
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
they're sitting on the same bench in

209
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
in this sort of geographically same area

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,000
but they belong to different

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,040
states

212
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
so um city states is like more like

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
singapore or like hong kong and those

214
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
places so it's a city and the state at

215
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
the same time

216
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,880
and so you know they so you know how

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
they do that is that sort of by

218
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,240
basically education so um you all you

219
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,399
know when you're growing up you're told

220
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,800
kind of what to see and what not to see

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
um from the um you know so basically you

222
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
can only see

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,959
some stuff from um your own region and

224
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
not from the other country and so um

225
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
that's how they sort of divide

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
so if you look at the um on the map like

227
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
where i was located and where i got

228
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
approached so um i i was approached by

229
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
minami saniku this is like the small

230
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
municipality in japan and then i was

231
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,160
where i was uh was in rotterdam and the

232
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,279
closest

233
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,800
coastal city is called the hague

234
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
um

235
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,399
and so basically we came up with this

236
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
idea of

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
somehow cutting off this

238
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
in-between area which includes the

239
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
entire american

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
continent

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,560
and

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
to to

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
to mush it together so that um it can

244
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
kind of form um

245
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,839
a region a new kind of uh a virtual

246
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
region where yours um where two

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,760
municipalities are separated

248
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
by the common channel

249
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
so like remarkably um the each

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
municipality um happened to have nearly

251
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,360
um exactly the same land area some sonic

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,720
had this you know 160 3.4 uh square

253
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
kilometers and then the the hey cam well

254
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
i had to actually sort of adjust a

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
little bit to kind of make it really um

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
needed the same um but yeah so basically

257
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
um

258
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
then this you can make a sort of into um

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
where you go um what we call it i mean

260
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
that sonic you had special art

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
experiment zone so

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
we basically kind of built it on top of

263
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
the um special economic zone so it's

264
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,320
kind of a mock of this um

265
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
essay essay sees that

266
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
so run this time i also learned quite a

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
strange

268
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,040
concept

269
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
from this friend of mine

270
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
it's called online lodging

271
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,720
so um

272
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,279
so you can just first read it um

273
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
what if um what the experience was like

274
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,720
a virtual stay online trip is definitely

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
worth experiences this person called

276
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,320
kurikurikun and stayed and in 2020 um

277
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
23rd of may

278
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
all things i loved about staying at

279
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,720
fujiyama bnb master the friendly host

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
the conversations with others in the

281
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
common living space the local kyoto info

282
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
you can now experience all from your

283
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
home anywhere in the world

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
with a sense of adventure but not that

285
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
much hope that it would be that

286
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
enjoyable i enjoyed one of the fujima b

287
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,959
b's virtual states but it turned out to

288
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
be a lot of fun online means it's

289
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
actually easy to strike up a

290
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,160
conversation with others and with screen

291
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
sharing you can share photos and your

292
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
online presence really easy enabling

293
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
comment connections to be made quickly

294
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,320
can't wait to actually stay there again

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,720
but i'm hoping that messer continues

296
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
with the virtual stage a great way to

297
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,320
experience kyoto in your living room

298
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
um so um this person could

299
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
even like

300
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
rates and value and rooms and service

301
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
everything and basically five stars so

302
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
um so um what they did actually um

303
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
was that the um

304
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
zoom conference

305
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,760
that sort of simulated um

306
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
the

307
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
common living space of like a hostel so

308
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
you imagine like if you're either

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,200
staying in a hostel and in kyoto and you

310
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,639
may be

311
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
well in the evening or so um maybe

312
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
sitting in this like a common living

313
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
space or something then you might get to

314
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,760
talk to um some of your fellow travelers

315
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
and sort of you know basically you know

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
like where did you go and oh how was

317
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
that and stuff like that you have this

318
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
kind of conversations and

319
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
so basically sort of they simulated this

320
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,480
conversational part only

321
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,399
online um

322
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,519
to kind of simulate this experience

323
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
they also i heard that they also showed

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
your bed and stuff like that through

325
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
this camera

326
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
webcam um but you know like it's just

327
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
like well okay so this is the bed i

328
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
would where or would we sleep in but you

329
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
know that's about it

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
so if you think about the um what the

331
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
essence of travel

332
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,399
this person

333
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,800
this photographer person called michio

334
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
hoshino

335
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,040
he was based in alaska for a very long

336
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,160
time he studied in alaska and he

337
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
also refused he wrote a lot many essays

338
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
as well and in this one of these his

339
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
essays he says that

340
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
in order for a person to travel and make

341
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
the landscape of a new land there are

342
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
they need to have someone else intervene

343
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,199
no matter how many countries we visit or

344
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,639
many times how many times we

345
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,800
circumnavigate the globe we will never

346
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
be able to feel the vastness of the

347
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,519
world on its own however when we meet

348
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,199
someone and fall in love with that

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,680
person the landscape becomes broader and

350
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
deeper for the first time

351
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,940
so um

352
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,320
[Music]

353
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
well what do you what he means is that

354
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
well in my interpretation um so

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,160
basically sort of when you visit

356
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
somewhere um you need to know somebody

357
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,399
uh from this place so that like you um

358
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
see this uh city that you visit for the

359
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,519
first time through this person through

360
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,240
the as a sort of lens and

361
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,079
so you kind of never become a tourist

362
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,320
really so um that's basically how i

363
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,399
understand

364
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,920
and he also says that um something

365
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
interesting about like uh

366
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,519
going to a barber shop so and this is my

367
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,760
own theory but if you want to smell the

368
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
local people when you're traveling go to

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
a barber shop i can't really explain why

370
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,639
but when i sit in the bible's chair with

371
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,720
the townspeople getting my hair cut and

372
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
shaved i somehow feel feel like i'm

373
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,599
local

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,800
the renowned travel writer person called

375
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
pico aya who spends most of his time

376
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
between japan and the u.s um he says

377
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
something about um kyoto as well um so

378
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,839
basically um he says that the um the

379
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
other thing i'd recommend is just to go

380
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
to mcdonald's outlet even in kyoto

381
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
you'll find

382
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
viewing burgers on the menu in september

383
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
and the owner of the traditional harvest

384
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
moon you encounter chicken tattoo

385
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
burgers and bacon potato pies and iced

386
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
tea made of our gray

387
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
and among customers who are usually

388
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
drilling and re-dressed and beautifully

389
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
mannered you see that even mcdonald's

390
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
become somewhere as

391
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,639
japanese as a traditional inn

392
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,199
so all these things um

393
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
points towards two things

394
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
um

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
to really travel somewhere um you need

396
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
to know um

397
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
somebody

398
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,800
from the place

399
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
and also like some like we're going

400
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
going having a haircut and there's like

401
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
a little bony body acts will help

402
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,839
experience enhancing this experience

403
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,279
um so we did this open call um for some

404
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,880
creators and artists to make uh

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
online lodging experiences um so this

406
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,519
project was funded by the um the embassy

407
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
of the netherlands um

408
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
so like this is like your the cards that

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
i made um i was the coordinator um i

410
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
called myself coordinator and then

411
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
approaching people um basically with

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
this card and so with this logo um from

413
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
the the embassy i look like some sort of

414
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,519
uh

415
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,480
diplomat person from this newly set up

416
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,399
territory so that was like that was also

417
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,120
kind of one of my aims

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
to make it look make myself look a bit

419
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
more official

420
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
so um i

421
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
uh well i looked uh i went to many

422
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,839
graduation shows um in the not within

423
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
the netherlands and i met two

424
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
interesting young artists um one of them

425
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,079
was idea derek's

426
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,760
she's originally from aruba which is

427
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
a part of the kingdom of the netherlands

428
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
it's actually located in south america

429
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
next to venezuela um it's a very small

430
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
country um

431
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
what she made was this um um

432
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
you know like those the uh photo

433
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
stand-ins uh which you find um in uh in

434
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
a sort of tourist spot so basically um

435
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
there's a photo some normally like a

436
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
photograph or some illustration then

437
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
there's like um

438
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
whole

439
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
cutouts and you can sort of fit your

440
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,919
face into that and get you get a

441
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,559
photograph taken so um what she was

442
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
doing was that kind of inverted version

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,080
of that so basically there's like a

444
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
green screen and then with a hole in it

445
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,559
and then you put your face in and then

446
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,600
you get a photograph taken then you

447
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
actually then walk to this

448
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,799
space next to it then um then you find

449
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,080
this like artificial beach and then sort

450
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,320
of you look around oh okay i arrived at

451
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
this beach um and you just

452
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,039
find that find that find out that

453
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,520
actually um your face is embedded right

454
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,919
in the middle of the sun so it's like a

455
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,000
um in a tourist

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,919
place normally okay you're expecting to

457
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
see um something more exotic and you

458
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,600
know

459
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
foreign

460
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,919
for yourself but you actually find the

461
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,039
most one of the most familiar things um

462
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
that is your face your own face

463
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,880
so the other artist i um found very

464
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
interesting is that

465
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,200
this person called the peter cly

466
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
he um

467
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
he lived by the side

468
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
on the coast of the and the hague and

469
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,760
this uh coastal city in the netherlands

470
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
and he um

471
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
since he lived there so he was actually

472
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
accumulating a lot of video footages um

473
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
on the coast and he basically sort of

474
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
made sort of video

475
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
collage

476
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,720
let me take a show

477
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,760
so what it mainly did was kind of

478
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,120
matching um the speed of the clouds and

479
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
the speed of the waves and so this well

480
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,720
in terms of the medium itself so it's i

481
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
would say it's quite traditional sort of

482
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,480
the um the

483
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,679
you know basically video and the

484
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
projection base but however the somehow

485
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,360
this combination of

486
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
this this piece

487
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
those clouds and waves

488
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
match together made some sort of a quite

489
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,799
surreal experience

490
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,799
oh sorry

491
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,520
so um

492
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
how we approach this um

493
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
this um residence program so um

494
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,720
i thought that he

495
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,080
it would be good to actually to um

496
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,559
right on top of like what he already

497
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,799
created so uh for his graduation show so

498
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,600
he

499
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,840
we suggested to make

500
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,919
take some footage from this region

501
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
called minami saniku so

502
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,880
we found this person who

503
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
has some filming experience on the phone

504
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,799
and

505
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
we did this virtual

506
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,760
film direction

507
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
so

508
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
we took advantage of the high

509
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
iphone penetration rate in japan so

510
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
everyone has an iphone in japan even if

511
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
they're based in a very remote village

512
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
or something like that so

513
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
in when we filmed in last year um was it

514
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,960
last year or the year before um

515
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
there was like the newest device was

516
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
iphone 12 mini and we

517
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
well he had that as well and the iphone

518
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,320
12 mini and uh and so what we did was

519
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,679
basically sort of

520
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,240
we already we asked the artist to look

521
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,440
through the

522
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,320
area on google street view and

523
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
trying to find some interesting spots so

524
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,679
basically on this day of the filming we

525
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
um drove to this actual place and sort

526
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
of we put up put the zoom up and sort of

527
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,240
we did this like um a bit of showing and

528
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
so we decided to sort of angle and

529
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
everything and you know did the final

530
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,240
filming and checking

531
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
so this is one of the footages um that's

532
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
uh produced like it's a place called a

533
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
cape kamivarisaki

534
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
um

535
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
this is uh the other footage that's been

536
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,120
produced um

537
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
the it's called the arashima island so

538
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
it's like a very small island that you

539
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
can which you can walk to from the main

540
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
island

541
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,840
we also did this uh virtual sketch what

542
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
we call um so um there's the quite a

543
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,400
famous uh pasture pressured pigs farm in

544
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
this region so we um asked the same

545
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
person to take a photograph of some of

546
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,080
the pigs instead of the the others on

547
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
this idea

548
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
she paints stuff so you know she

549
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,679
actually sort of made some paintings um

550
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,480
based on those pics

551
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,039
um she also went to um the one of the

552
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
most famous tourist spots in the the

553
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
netherlands called the southeast hans

554
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,720
and he she did she put this uh 360

555
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
videos um

556
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,918
films

557
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,080
um

558
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,960
so um so this this was like my idea but

559
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
um

560
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,799
um

561
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,679
i wanted to um something this thing um

562
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,000
um called the kovid18 antigen test kit

563
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
was um introduced into our lives um this

564
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
you know box that you can kind of order

565
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
online and then it comes with cotton

566
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,799
swabs and you know qr codes and

567
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
those things just you know slowly got

568
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
introduced to our lives and um

569
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
so we basically sort of what i wanted to

570
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
do is to somehow um

571
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,600
you know if there's a lot like kind of

572
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,559
hole

573
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,520
in our reality that's been made then why

574
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
not like

575
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
trying to sort of um play with that

576
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
rather

577
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
so i did also the idea of the connecting

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
somehow to this uh google this to a

579
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
google cardboard which is which was

580
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
discontinued in

581
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
march

582
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,279
uh last year and so um

583
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,600
well discontinued meaning means that

584
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
there's a lot more um the um designs

585
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
available um so like you're kind of a

586
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,400
you know like a try i'm basically trying

587
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
to find um

588
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,320
um

589
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
this sort of design that actually fits

590
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,919
nearly

591
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,159
that's nearly identical to

592
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
a um

593
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
test kit basically

594
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
so um this is the

595
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
resulting

596
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
package

597
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
that's

598
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,000
placed right next to this um

599
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,039
the kobe 19 engine test kit um

600
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,559
what it is is actually was the and the

601
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,039
so it was like actually google cardboard

602
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
basically so you know basically it

603
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,679
nearly looks identical and then you

604
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
buy this thing instead of a well

605
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,200
normally like in the call with trouble

606
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,840
protocol you buy this travel kit and you

607
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
get this thing delivered to your house

608
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
and you get tested and you have to have

609
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,880
there's a negative result then you go on

610
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
to the travel but in our

611
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,120
package

612
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
you buy this thing and it gets posted to

613
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,120
you

614
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
and then you open it and you assemble

615
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,159
the hazard and you go directly into the

616
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
turbo so that's how you basically you

617
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,440
know

618
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,279
skip this like this process

619
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
so this is the um the demo of

620
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,200
the

621
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,600
one of the apps

622
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,840
yeah you start from the sauna because

623
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
there's a

624
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,559
quite a big

625
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,640
sauna boom in japan right now so just

626
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,679
like you

627
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,200
only want to ride on top of that

628
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,520
so it's like a sort of the um it's

629
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,600
basically um the some of the image

630
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
which is from the netherlands and japan

631
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,679
combined in

632
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,919
um

633
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
in in one scene so that's basically

634
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
what it was

635
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
you can navigate through this

636
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,320
bottoms

637
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,080
oh

638
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,109
[Music]

639
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
normally there's this main main mainland

640
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
you can see from this view but you see

641
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,000
this actually the netherlands from

642
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,799
um

643
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,158
this island so yes

644
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,539
[Music]

645
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,159
it's like two statues combined in one

646
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,559
thing sorry one the one on the right is

647
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,200
a statue from japan and the other one

648
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
is actually the study from the

649
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,960
netherlands

650
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,279
so combining one

651
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,279
scene

652
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,120
then you hit this um last spot

653
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,440
which is the uh the cape camille setting

654
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
he said where we did this virtual film

655
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,840
direction

656
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,159
so where you see actually is the the

657
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,640
it's not the actual um the sun from

658
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,600
japan where actually the sunrise um from

659
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,080
the netherlands that appeared

660
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
in between

661
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
this

662
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,700
okay

663
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,630
[Music]

664
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,019
[Music]

665
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,399
so um this is the other app that we made

666
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
um so um

667
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,159
we um we wanted to uh also like um

668
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,320
made an extension of the the the

669
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,799
artist's work that

670
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,559
that's produced for the graduation show

671
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,960
so um

672
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,799
so

673
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
we basically sort of virtualize the

674
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,960
photo standing experience

675
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
and

676
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,080
we bring to this

677
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,840
360 degrees video

678
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,120
so if you first open the app

679
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,520
and then you

680
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
fit your face in um like you did with no

681
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,799
with normally with the um

682
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,399
photo sounding but it's like a green

683
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,200
screen

684
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,120
that's exactly what the artist did for

685
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,080
the graduation show

686
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
and then go into the scene and

687
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
this is soundses cars the one of the

688
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
most famous tourist spots in the

689
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
netherlands

690
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,039
and you see this the

691
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,760
pigs walking around

692
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,039
and if you look closely and you find

693
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,679
your face embedded right in the middle

694
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,559
of the

695
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,879
of the pig

696
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,159
um so the um so this is how well how i

697
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,720
designed the headset so it was a

698
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,840
already found this existing the pattern

699
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
um

700
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,120
and this was like from a canadian

701
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
university i think um so it basically

702
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,799
sort of took me more

703
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,679
um time to find the light supplier and

704
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,399
the right design uh for this

705
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,559
experience um than

706
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,399
actually sort of for designing um

707
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,679
so this is a team that

708
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,559
we worked with so um we're like spread

709
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,519
it like all over the world so um two

710

748
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,239
to the um

749
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,879
kobe 19 antigen test kit so where in

750
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,839
fact it's a

751
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,520
foldable headset

752
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,719
and you assemble um

753
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,839
like this

754
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,839
oops

755
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,320
yeah and then it becomes a headset

756
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,839
then um you basically there's a qr code

757
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,800
here

758
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,280
which you can scan and then serve you

759
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,879
basically

760
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,598
yeah you then

761
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,560
put your phone into it and then

762
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,440
and

763
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,920

uh thanks for the talk uh would you

767
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
consider extending this project to any

768
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
other pair of cities i know that this

769
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,359
pair was particularly you know

770
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,440
important for your situation but i could

771
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
see this being really cool for other

772
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
places too

773
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
yeah like actually i got like asked by

774
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,400
many people like if you if i'm

775
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
interested to actually make into like a

776
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
more um

777
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
um

778
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,440
we said like a kind of series let me get

779
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,760
into a series series or something but

780
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
for me personally i'm

781
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,160
not super interested to actually sort of

782
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
you know like

783
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,640
it

784
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,240
it just happened to be in this way for

785
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
me like you know like a sort of um and

786
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
that's why like how it's interesting

787
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
sort of you know because it's like based

788
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,160
on um contingency and stuff um yeah if i

789
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
once decided to make it into a series

790
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,599
then what's um i don't find this medium

791
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,280
interesting anymore i don't find i don't

792
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,119
know just like the older app development

793
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,000
process

794
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,079
everything

795
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,839
i just i i

796
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,000
would lose my interest in working on

797
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
that so i guess

798
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,320
