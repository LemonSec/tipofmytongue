privacy issues

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,560
different than we were going to have it

was going to be a

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
talk on sonography it's not about

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
medical devices so if you get the chance

23
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,399

24
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,280

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
if you run into the hallways and they

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
would love to have you come in and help

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,439

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,799
for you if they get the chance to help

32
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
out

33
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
for this talk please make sure you mute

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
your cell phones and other devices the

35
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
speakers are quite sensitive and tend to

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
pick them up relatively easily

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
with that we are going to go into the

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,720
next talk with nick germain on secure

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
cell phone communication mission

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
accomplished or popular delusion so with

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
that take it away nick

42
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,359
thank you

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
uh

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
how many people have ever heard of a

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
secure

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,640
mobile phone

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,800
and i'm curious to learn uh i basically

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,240
um

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
[Music]

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,400
uh brought together as much content as

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
possible so that i could present it to

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
you

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
uh there is more content but there are

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
many many companies that claim that they

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,400
have secure products

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
and um i personally have not uh quite

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
found one that completely checks out

58
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,240
um

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,040
[Music]

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
uh let's see

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
see

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
um but um even before i begin to get

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
into the nuts and the bolts of uh the

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
search for uh secure communication i i

65
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
want to get a general idea

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,200
of uh what the great value of secure

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
communication would be

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,879
uh for uh you all uh what what is what

69
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
is missing from the equation now

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,239
uh

71
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,480
during this period that it's so hard to

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
find

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
communications that you can trust

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
and um

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
uh i i i i'd like as much as much

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
participation as you as you feel like

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
giving um

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,239
but uh this this is question number one

79
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,840
what would you do with a secure

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
telephone a secure communication if you

81
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
had it would you do anything different

82
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,720
than if you're using a

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
uh

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
what i like to call my eye hole

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,050
um

86
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,239
[Music]

87
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,239
please

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
is

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
um

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
what is the best thing to use your

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
what is the best thing to do with with

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,160
secure communication we could be

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
speculating what could what can't we do

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,199
now that we would like to do if we had

95
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,320
some

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,639
some confidence that well we weren't

97
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
getting bugged and we

98
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,840
something well yeah i'm actually um on

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
the hardware level things like the

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
baseband um or even having an assurance

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
that when um you

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
through the operating system you know

103
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
turn turn off like you know certain

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
components certain radios that that is

105
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
actually happening but you don't have

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
any physical issues

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
right i agree with you very much of

108
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
course uh basically we want to be able

109
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
to trust

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
the microphone we're talking into to be

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,520
conveying the the the the idea that um

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
uh that we were trying to convey

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,919
um

114
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,199
uh however um

115
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,680
uh i want to bring up this

116
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
this other point that um

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
[Music]

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
seems to be disturbing um oh sir one

119
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
more i think my concern would be that

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,719
the phone's doing things

121
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
so the question for me is can i have a

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
phone with me all the time

123
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,000
uh versus having to leave it behind so

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
that i've not observed

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
because i can't trust that it's doing

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
what i asked which is what everyone's

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
saying

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
but the

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
yes

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
you asked what behavior

131
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,919
would we engage in if we do

132
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
vietnam was very unpopular

133
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,919
and they were sending uh american

134
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,120
students

135
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
to get chopped up in vietnam

136
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,199
and um

137
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
uh this is the this was a very early

138
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
period in the history of television

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
and um the reporters who were going out

140
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
looking for stories

141
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,400
they

142
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
felt uh that the most interesting thing

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
going on in the streets of many many

144
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,080
cities was that people were

145
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
demonstrating and that was good tv

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
and so

147
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
uh

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
the 50s didn't see a lot going on as far

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
as uh uh not a great deal of um

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,399
what would we call this uh public uh

151
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
sentiment getting uh in into the public

152
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,600
um

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
into the public eye

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,640
and so uh television began to mature

155
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
and they began to show the the reaction

156
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
to uh the the the opposition to uh

157
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
government activities

158
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,839
and um

159
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,839
that war came to an end

160
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,200
and um

161
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
this is a remarkable piece of history um

162
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
it came to an end because people

163
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
got up and spoke and they um

164
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
sure they were beat up in a lot of

165
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
places and they uh ran into opposition

166
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
from the authorities but they managed to

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
get a point across and um

168
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
and uh it was a major turning point in

169
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
the united states history um

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
uh

171
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
i'm not sure if that can happen again

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
today

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,040
in the same manner because the tv

174
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
doesn't cover it and um it doesn't get

175
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
to as many people as it did

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
and um

177
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,080
uh

178
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
look i dare say the quality of

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
journalism has uh deteriorated

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
drastically since that period and um

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
uh actually the topic of um what is an

182
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,480
authoritative source

183
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
for information came up a couple of

184
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,760
times

185
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
uh in the uh in the big room one in the

186
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
opening

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
uh

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
conversation

189
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,200
uh the young the young woman who um

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,390
spoke about uh exposing uh

191
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,120
[Music]

192
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
psychological operations and it just

193
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
came up once again because the keynote

194
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,040
speaker

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
is talking about when she was working at

196
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
facebook

197
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,630
uh facebook um

198
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,160
[Music]

199
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
had a couple of these sponsored we could

200
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
call them psychological operations one

201
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
in azerbaijan and one in honduras where

202
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
false information was

203
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
put onto facebook and presented as uh as

204
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,480
honest information and it

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,279
threw the election to the uh

206
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,519
to the authoritarian figures that uh

207
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,360
that uh sponsored this

208
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
um

209
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,640
and one thing that the young lady said

210
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
uh yesterday morning

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
when i asked her well what do you

212
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
consider a um

213
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,959
a legitimate source for news and she

214
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
mentioned the new york times and

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
uh i think anybody who read the rolling

216
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,079
stone in 1977 october there was a story

217
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
by carl bernstein that exposed the new

218
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
york times once and for all you don't

219
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,160
have to read two stories after you read

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
that one

221
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
um about

222
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
i think the title of it was the cia and

223
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
the media it it addressed the times but

224
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
it also addressed cbs and basically most

225
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
of the big the big outlets are um

226
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,120
uh

227
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
not really not to be trusted according

228
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
to this source and um

229
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
bernstein was good at that at that

230
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
moment for some reason he really he did

231
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
a good job to um

232
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
uh back in 77.

233
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
so um

234
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
the question really is what are the

235
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,880
legitimate sources and so

236
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,040
if um if we're trying to both have um

237
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
people speaking standing up on their

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
hind legs and expressing themselves

239
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
um it's very hard to do when you when

240
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,240
you're under surveillance and um

241
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
uh there's a special kind of

242
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
surveillance when you're carrying it

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
around in your

244
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,839
uh in your uh

245
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
what's a polite word for the back pocket

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
i guess the back pocket would be a

247
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,680
polite word for it um

248
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
or or in your front pocket

249
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,120
um

250
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
and um

251
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
uh you may have heard these stories

252
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,410
about how um

253
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,519
[Music]

254
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
uh

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
when when the uh when the facebook

256
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
pings and noise on your phone

257
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,160
uh your endocrine system kicks in and

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,240
you have an adrenaline rush

259
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
uh and um etc etc this is this is

260
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
messing with the human animal quite a

261
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,610
bit and um

262
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,519
[Music]

263
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,000
to know that there's somebody watching

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
you or listening to you all the time

265
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,519
also has a major effect and um

266
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
this is uh this was pointed out in a in

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,639
a talk by uh glenn greenwald

268
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
geez i don't know how many years ago

269
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
this was at carnegie hall uh but i

270
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
thought it was very very um

271
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
very very valuable

272
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
that he um

273
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
that he uh pointed this out

274
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,040
he said that um

275
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,399
when you want to

276
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
when you want to summon up the courage

277
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
to go and stand up and say no this is

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
not right and to express yourself and to

279
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
do all those things that the american

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
flag is associated with like

281
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
trying to protect your neighbors your

282
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
country and honoring

283
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,079
truth justice and the american way it

284
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
takes it takes a lot of guts and to

285
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
summon up that courage you need to be

286
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,320
alone you need to have a little space

287
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
and if somebody is watching you you're

288
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
not alone and it's very hard to get the

289
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
guts to do it and that

290
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,880
the memory that somebody is on top of

291
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,600
you

292
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
at that moment that you're trying to

293
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
summon up that courage

294
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,199
is often going to

295
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
make it impossible to summon up that

296
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,639
courage so there there is a

297
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
it is a very very powerful thing that

298
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
we're walking around with these cell

299
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,800
phones now and so um

300
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,760
uh i'm i'm trying to remember how long

301
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
ago

302
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,399
um i i i i guess i should just ask and

303
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
get a show of hands if i may um how many

304
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,279
people try to protect their security uh

305
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,800
and

306
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,440
we don't have any ink here i

307
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,839
basically on on a um

308
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
on a measure of like one to five

309
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
if five meaning you were absolutely

310
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,440
secure and you trust the communications

311
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
uh venues that you use and one being you

312
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,040
give it a shot i think heartthrow thank

313
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
you

314
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
all right backhand is not that easy

315
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,120
um

316
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,519
um

317
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
one mean one meaning

318
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,199
you try a little bit

319
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
and five meaning you think you've got it

320
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,399
nailed and i'm just curious about how

321
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
many people just try at least a minimum

322
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,519
amount uh to to um to to secure their

323
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,399
communications be it on the internet

324
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
on the uh on the telephone etc do we

325
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
have very many people okay there's a

326
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
little bit there's just about

327
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,199
a half dozen i would say

328
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
um how many people put some effort into

329
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,519
it put their shoulder to the grindstone

330
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,880
and and really

331
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
give it a good a good push

332
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,360
all right that's about ten

333
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
and um

334
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,560
how many people

335
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
spend a lot of time

336
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,920
trying to get to sleep at night trying

337
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
to fix this problem

338
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
i mean who really care about this and

339
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
that's even more than the previous

340
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,839
and

341
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
how many think they got the uh the devil

342
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
on the run here that there we are within

343
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
reach of possibly

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
uh securing our communication if we do

345
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
everything in our power

346
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,399
and that's

347
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,959
about one

348
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
and so i don't even want to go to five

349
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,959
because i think we might have

350
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,000
a negative uh integer up there

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
um

352
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
so um

353
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
basically uh

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,199
i also am interested in um

355
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
in trying to figure out

356
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
the best way

357
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
the the way to be most secure

358
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,839
and

359
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,280
um and it is it is very very hard and uh

360
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
the the hardware that we deal with that

361
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
appears to be the most

362
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
uh the most important

363
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,039
uh device

364
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
more so than the computer you could put

365
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,000
different

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
uh tools and antiviruses and all kinds

367
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,319
of things you could you have a little

368
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
bit more control over the computer but

369
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
this little monster you have a lot less

370
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
control

371
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,039
and um

372
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
and so um

373
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,559
let me

374
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,360
let me return to my notes over here um

375
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
ah

376
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,600
and forgive me i i i'm uh i i prefer to

377
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
do these things

378
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
interactively with you all and so

379
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
returning to my notes is not as much

380
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
not as much fun

381
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,719
uh uh uh uh

382
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
well let me go back to the to the

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
earlier part of the equation we want to

384
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
be safe we don't want false information

385
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
however

386
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,960
it it appears to me uh i'm judging from

387
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
the level of political activity that is

388
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,520
to say

389
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,799
protest

390
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
uh and questioning of authority in

391
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
american culture at this time that um

392
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
there appears to be

393
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
a a very low level for anybody who was

394
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,280
aware of or alive during these 60s and

395
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
even the 70s and so

396
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
um

397
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
it would occur to me that probably one

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
of the most valuable things you could do

399
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
if you if if you were secure

400
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
in your identity and insecure in your

401
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
ability to speak is to probably get up

402
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,039
there and speak now

403
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
we see every day in the papers that

404
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
uh corporations have attained more and

405
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,640
more power uh every day of

406
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,360
every day for the past many many years

407
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,880
and so

408
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
uh we wonder whether

409
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,000
there is even politics in the united

410
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
states and if the people who win

411
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
elections we're not sure if they just

412
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
throw them to the other side we don't

413
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,679
you know the the the

414
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,300
uh the level of um

415
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,039
[Music]

416
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
sincerity of the system seems to be at

417
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,080
an all-time low and so

418
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
um

419
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
it does occur to me that if people felt

420
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
safer there would be uh there would be

421
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
uh uh opposition there would be more

422
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
like more than one point of view that

423
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,280
was uh in charge of the country

424
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,600
so we kind of are at a period when the

425
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,919
population is i i dare say the

426
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
population

427
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
is much much weaker than it was in the

428
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
past and it it's not gradual it's been

429
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,520
it's been

430
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
decreasing quite a bit for a long time

431
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
and again i don't know if anyone

432
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,039
if if if this is obvious to you all or

433
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
not but i'm i'm very curious i i've been

434
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
to many countries and i observed

435
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
the politics in many countries and

436
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,159
there's very few that have

437
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,280
such a

438
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
a limited level of um of uh support from

439
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,320
the public uh to my knowledge but

440
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
actually i

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
one thing i really appreciate is

442
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
somebody disagreeing with me

443
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,080
and um

444
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,960
uh that's what i'm hoping for and it's

445
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
it's quite welcome it's it's uh

446
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,799
it's the

447
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,840
the the best uh the best response is to

448
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,400
get uh more of a a dialogue

449
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
there's no reason to believe me unless i

450
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
present sufficient evidence of it and uh

451
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,640
uh to be challenged on it is is a good

452
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
way to acquire that

453
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,880
let's see um

454
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,880
so the question of if we had oh please

455
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
just to make sure

456
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
you're right you're saying that

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
in your

458
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
observation

459
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
and based on those observations your

460
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,039
opinion is that we seem to be

461
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,520
entirely without protests without

462
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,080
protest not zero but but not significant

463
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
it's remarkably

464
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
low level i mean uh what if we compare

465
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
it you go back to the iraq war there

466
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,720
were there were demonstrations but um

467
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
uh

468
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,760
you go back to the 60s and um there was

469
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,679
less than one percent of the population

470
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
on the streets in the 60s but it it

471
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
succeeded in bringing an end to the war

472
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,520
that and a very well organized country

473
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,039
called vietnam

474
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
um

475
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,840
but um

476
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
uh

477
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
i mean i'm i'm curious do people

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,280
consider the present level of

479
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
participation of the population of the

480
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
united states to be

481
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
highly significant or

482
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
moderately or low and why don't we go

483
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
back to this

484
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
concept here one two and three how many

485
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
people consider the level of um

486
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
political participation to be

487
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
substantial

488
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,840
in the united

489
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,520
states uh

490
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,320
that's three people and uh i want to ask

491
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
if

492
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
who feels that it's

493
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
it's unusually low for uh a population

494
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
of uh

495
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,360
uh large primates

496
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,679
see this is this is my observation too

497
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
and i i appreciate that you're sharing

498
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that with me um

499
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
if you've seen many many different

500
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,799
examples many many different societies

501
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440
it's much easier to judge it's it's very

502
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
hard to judge when you're here and you

503
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
you you've just heard it uh

504
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,799
and you just get what is available on

505
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
the uh on the tv and the radio and the

506
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,840
internet

507
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,559
um and so

508
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,600
um

509
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
i believe also when it comes to these

510
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
devices this has a very significant

511
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,240
level of effect on

512
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,760
uh silencing the population the and this

513
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
is this is a very powerful psychological

514
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
tool

515
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
that's this is a very interesting case

516
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
um and uh

517
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,640
it's it's actually an excellent uh point

518
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
right at this point of the dialogue

519
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
um

520
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,600
i remember uh shortly before the uh

521
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,840
black lives matter became

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
well known or etc

523
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,760
there was there was this thing going

524
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
around the internet that said that every

525
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400
24 hours

526
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
uh the police the amer

527
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
an american police officer shot an

528
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
unarmed black man

529
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
and i dug into it and actually it's hard

530
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,559
to get these statistics i had to i had

531
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,360
to use the fbi reports

532
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,279
and and that's the source of this but

533
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,080
they said every 72 hours

534
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
an unarmed black man is shot by police

535
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,400
in the united states all right well

536
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
that's that that's huge too just like 24

537
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,640
72 is pretty high for shooting uh

538
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
unarmed people and so um

539
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,120
uh

540
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,640
things move along uh uh

541
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,679
my view of this country is through uh uh

542
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,440
the lens of new york

543
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
and there are really constantly these

544
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,440
cases uh

545
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,039
one after the other

546
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,679
and um

547
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,679
uh

548
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,279
and finally the event in uh was it west

549
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
st louis is that the name of the town

550
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,799
where um

551
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,279
where that uh took place yes i think it

552
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
was west st louis it's

553
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
right next to st louis and um

554
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,440
and uh it ignited uh a lot of actions

555
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,760
all over the country because it was

556
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
so blatant that it

557
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,880
it it was

558
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,320
it's almost like they were trying to get

559
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,159
a get attention um and um

560
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,799
and that was my first uh the first time

561
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,039
that black lives matter came

562
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,679
to a very high level of visibility in

563
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,279
the united states

564
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:47,710
um

565
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,520
[Music]

566
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
uh

567
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,760
i'm i'm wondering

568
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
how effective

569
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
how much things have changed since i

570
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,960
don't know the numbers of unarmed black

571
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,160
men being executed by police but um

572
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,039
[Music]

573
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
but it may be it may be a very good

574
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,960
example of

575
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
the positive side the fact that uh there

576
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,919
were people beginning to

577
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,919
stand up and be more aggressive in

578
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,880
opposing what is uh go it's beyond

579
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,360
outrageous it's it's medieval

580
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,559
what's going on out there

581
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,760
however

582
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,520
however

583
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,440
that also brought like a high point to

584
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,080
something they call um

585
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
uh identity politics

586
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,440
this is uh this is another

587
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
another thing that gets uh that is very

588
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,640
popular especially on the on the um

589
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,080
on the internet and etc and i i i wonder

590
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
how many people um

591
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
are familiar with this with this concept

592
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
is identity politics everybody um know

593
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,320
that term or may shall i explain it

594
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,200
even one person i can explain it for

595
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
um i'm happy to

596
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,120
oh please um

597
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,679
absolutely absolutely um

598
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,919
well

599
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
basic i'll try to do it in one sentence

600
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
but um

601
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
unfortunately when we protect one

602
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
identity we divide

603
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
we divide the class that is

604
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
that is being taken advantage of and it

605
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,919
it kind of um

606
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,679
costs costs us in in the uh

607
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,399
in the overall realm so there are

608
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,399
positives and negatives to this stuff

609
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
the pr the problem is people are not

610
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,559
getting together and

611
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
doing what used to happen and happens in

612
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,360
almost every other country if we look at

613
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,559
the news

614
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,200
the um i i think uh a good

615
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
a good measurement actually i remember

616
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,200
one of my

617
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,000
one of my colleagues um

618
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
he pointed out that uh

619
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
when covid first came out

620
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
um

621
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
people lost their jobs in the united

622
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
states but um they didn't lose their

623
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
jobs in europe

624
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,159
because as he put it if the government

625
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,240
said you're all going to lose your jobs

626
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,159
uh instead of what the government's

627
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,039
actually said which was you you're going

628
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,720
to keep your job you're just not going

629
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,399
in so when this is over you're going to

630
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,120
come back you still have a job um

631
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,919
if if they did if they did what they did

632
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
in the united states

633
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,320
uh in europe uh they would have the

634
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,240
plazas would have been filled with

635
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,159
people they wouldn't have let it go by

636
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,320
there is a different a different dynamic

637
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,880
in the united states than in europe

638
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,919
um all right all right the uh

639
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
so

640
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
is the premise of your talk that

641
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,880
because cell phones are insecure in the

642
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,279
united states

643
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,159
yes

644
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
well it's not that's not the only reason

645
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,120
there there may be 50 reasons or a dozen

646
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
reasons but

647
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
yes

648
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,159
um

649
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
but uh

650
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
it's a lot easier to get a secure

651
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,399
telephone in if you're in if you're in

652
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,000
europe than if you're in the united

653
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
states that's that's an interesting

654
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,919
phenomenon um

655
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
and that's that's probably the cue to

656
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
get back to the uh

657
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,480
to get back onto

658
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
the united states and europe when it

659
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,480
comes to political

660
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,840
action of the united states at the end

661
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,399
of the cold

662
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
from war supposed victory over communism

663
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
and that's really

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
like europe was still divided at that

665
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
time and was coming out while the united

666
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,080
states has centered its

667
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,000
you know it was the imperial capital of

668
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
that

669
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,720
americans

670
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,840
kind of got along with the government

671
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,799
because uh the

672
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,640
washington won the cold war did i get

673
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,039
you right

674
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,480
like

675
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,679
people can't imagine a world

676
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,600
this is just with respect to capitalism

677
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
where capitalism doesn't exist it's

678
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
become this supposed reality i think

679
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,120
this is reflected not just by that sense

680
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,960
but with also a lot of the movements

681
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,279
that we have now i think there is a lot

682
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,720
of political activity in the united

683
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
states but it's not so much like radical

684
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,080
it's not as radical as it was

685
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
historically it's like you don't have to

686
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,159
like things comparable to say the black

687
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
panther party today in the united states

688
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,320
which is like explicitly marxist

689
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,039
leninist explicitly trying over the

690
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,399
united states

691
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
while we do have a lot more

692
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,840
liberal

693
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,440
political movements today in the united

694
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,399
states

695
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,600
and that's because they've

696
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,039
there's like the reality of liberalism

697
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,200
forgive me a reality of what liberalism

698
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
do you think

699
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,200
the political activity today

700
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,559
compares to the political activity

701
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
in the united states compares to the

702
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,919
political level of political

703
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,799
sophistication in europe

704
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,159
well i don't know i don't know enough

705
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,440
about it

706
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,519
okay well your report is well taken and

707
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,279
uh basically

708
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,440
uh i kind of wanted to

709
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
ask

710
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,080
what would you do if you had a secure

711
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,279
phone

712
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,279
and um the question of um

713
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
if you had more security if you had more

714
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,159
privacy if you were a little more if you

715
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,200
were 150 more protected by not having

716
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,559
somebody uh watch you 24 7.

717
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
and um

718
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
let's see uh

719
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,519
uh i sat down with a book a couple of

720
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,559
weeks ago called future crimes uh author

721
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,559
is a guy named mark goodman

722
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,320
and um

723
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,640
what he did was he in one one of the

724
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
chapters he listed all of the things

725
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,440
that

726
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,279
really that google does that um

727
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,360
that uh

728
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
uh capture uh

729
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,840
pretty much our thoughts and our and our

730
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,799
um and our behavior and how many steps

731
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,440
we take and all of this kind of thing

732
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,559
um

733
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
and uh it's actually

734
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
rather scary uh to see

735
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,880
how invasive

736
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,919
this particular company is it uh it

737
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,320
parallels with apple as well

738
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,279
um i i mentioned steps i look on this

739
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,440
and i see how many steps i took and i

740
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,519
never programmed it to ask how many

741
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
steps i took on in a given day or where

742
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,399
those steps were taken

743
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,799
uh but it does remind you that

744
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,320
you're not alone

745
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,700
um

746
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,869
[Music]

747
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
and so basically i i my intent was to

748
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
line up all of this

749
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,760
before i go into the nuts and the bolts

750
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,750
of telephones um

751
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,840
[Music]

752
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,159
they're

753
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,559
all right i have an article um that

754
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
asks can i buy a phone that doesn't use

755
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,760
anything from google or apple

756
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,079
and the question stands uh does is

757
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,839
anybody aware of a phone that doesn't

758
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,719
use google or apple

759
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,040
say it again

760
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,440
pine phone

761
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,639
pine bini correct excellent answer

762
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
because

763
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,800
if you want a phone that uh

764
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
has has very few

765
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,918
i don't want to say tracking devices but

766
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,679
uh it

767
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,280
you you don't

768
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
if i'm correct uh what i read about pine

769
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,900
phone is that um

770
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,159
[Music]

771
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,679
uh

772
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,480
you're are you using uh email on pine

773
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,719
phone or is it just a phone

774
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,918
just the linux phone

775
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,799
siri linux operating system

776
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,800
in any case there is a phone that

777
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,640
probably is the most secure phone that's

778
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
accessible it's about 150 bucks maybe

779
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
200 bucks and it's called a pine phone

780
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
however

781
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
these are not widely used because they

782
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,480
don't have access to

783
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
uh the many apps that people

784
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
seem to be

785
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,240
uh interested in the

786
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,599
the public

787
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,560
uh

788
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,240
is has become uh used to

789
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,119
having uh many different uh functions of

790
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,240
their phone like uh much like an eyehole

791
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,599
um

792
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,480
and so unfortunately it appears to be

793
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,119
a very limited number of people who are

794
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,359
getting into specifically something like

795
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,760
the pine phone and it uh it's

796
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,359
unfortunate sir

797
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,280
isn't there also a problem with your

798
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,200
carrier tracking you no matter how

799
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,118
secure you make your phone if you attach

800
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
your carrier has a bit more power than

801
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,400
we than most people know

802
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,359
correct um

803
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,400
uh

804
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,079
there is the obvious

805
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,880
there is the obvious uh trail that you

806
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,680
leave when you turn on your phone

807
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,000
the towers know exactly where you are

808
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
and you're picked up and your location

809
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,800
is identifiable um

810
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,440
however what you're talking about is the

811
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,560
carrier itself has some ability to

812
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,520
communicate directly to your phone

813
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,359
do you remember the term for that the uh

814
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,200
baseband modem uh baseband

815
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,000
oh okay the base band there is a

816
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
baseband in your phone that is

817
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
controlled by the uh

818
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,000
by the the networks themselves

819
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
uh i just learned this yesterday from a

820
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
gentleman who was sitting at the table

821
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,079
of the uh

822
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,280
the free software foundation

823
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
uh and um

824
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
we're looking into it a little more

825
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,040
deeply um

826
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,119
but uh

827
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,680
there is also something called a nokia

828
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,640
phone oh so please

829
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,280
say that again please so the pine phone

830
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,200
is the only modem in a commercial cell

831
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
phone that you're able to flash

832
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,839
it's the only cell phone that can the

833
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
modem in the cell phone for controlling

834
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,959
the communications

835
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,599
from the uh that the carrier can access

836
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,760
no

837
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,119
and you can flash it is that the right

838
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,720
word in other words you could turn it

839
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
off

840
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
there's a hardware kill switch you can

841
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,000
turn it off that's no problem but you

842
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,760
can also flash it and control the

843
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,839
software as well

844
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,599
interesting well thank you for that

845
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,760
again

846
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
most of this a lot of this stuff

847
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,839
requires a group like this to actually

848
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,480
uh learn a little bit uh more about it

849
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,680
um

850
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,320
i'm gonna bring up the nokia because uh

851
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,599
uh

852
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,760
the most popular

853
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,040
handsets

854
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
that

855
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,640
have ever been manufactured i believe

856
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,040
three or four of the most popular were

857
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,000
manufactured by nokia and

858
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,640
this is a very simple phone

859
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,599
to be honest i've never operated it but

860
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,480
um

861
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,359
it's mostly uh communicating uh back and

862
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,839
forth has anyone ever used this level of

863
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,359
technology

864
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,280
oh sir would you be kind enough to

865
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
inform us

866
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,599
um

867
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,400
what apps are on a nokia phone i know

868
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
you have things like a radio but you

869
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,079
could

870
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,920
no apps

871
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
so all you're doing is talking

872
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
thank god thank god this is basically

873
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
what what i understood to be the case

874
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,359
but i wanted i wanted to get a source

875
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,599
better than the one that i used um

876
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,960
boom so you could talk on this now

877
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
uh oh forgive me

878
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
before there was android or iphone or

879
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,200
anything like that

880
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,960
in low resource countries a lot of

881
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
people did use apps on their nokia

882
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,119
phones very simple

883
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,640
um

884
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
i'm forgetting the name of the protocol

885
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
but it's the same protocol that they

886
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,760
used for wap

887
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,839
that's basically like a long sms

888
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,040
protocol um i used to work for a company

889
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,400
called fring

890
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,680
that had a nokia app so that you could

891
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,760
send text messages and even have phone

892
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,560
calls

893
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,599
using

894
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,240
the internet data

895
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,640
over what

896
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
okay uh optional

897
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,920
uh

898
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
it's it seems consistent with what the

899
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
gentleman pointed out

900
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,599
um

901
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,319
however um

902
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,200
this technology is a g2 i don't believe

903
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,720
we can

904
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,000
we can uh access

905
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,839
i don't believe we could access g2

906
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,880
anymore

907
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
outside

908
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
and

909
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,000
there we have that let me uh

910
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,319
bring up this topic this is basically a

911
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,319
device a blackberry that you could use

912
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,319
for texting

913
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
many of these did not have microphones

914
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
you can't be spied upon without a

915
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
microphone and um

916
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,160
so these were considered secure for

917
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,319
quite a long time and

918
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,040
ceos and guys with excessive amounts of

919
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,359
money uh we're using these for their

920
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,000
business communications uh that's the

921
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,839
reputation they have

922
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,720
again

923
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,319
this company

924
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,280
is not

925
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,880
doing very well anymore i'm not even

926
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
sure if they're manufacturing anymore

927
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,119
but there was a period of time when

928
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,119
people relied on these

929
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,319
um

930
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,880
i'm going to name

931
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,640
a few other

932
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,720
uh a few other

933
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
choices

934
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,599
uh i go i mentioned ubuntu earlier

935
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,960
that's a linux uh operating system again

936
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,079
linux is not apple and it's not android

937
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,240
that is to say it's not apple and it's

938
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
not google

939
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,480
and so

940
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,880
it is a different language and and so

941
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,280
you're going to have a a considerable

942
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,720
about much more privacy in dealing with

943
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,079
um

944
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,800
uh something that is ubuntu or

945
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
or linux in general

946
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,800
um

947
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,160
let's see

948
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,759
and then there is

949
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,280
there are the very expensive phones that

950
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
started coming out and what they tend to

951
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,040
do is put

952
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,480
apps on top of the operating system such

953
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
as a

954
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,440
such as the kill switches on certain

955
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
phones where you could turn off the

956
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
battery turn off the microphone turn off

957
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,400
anything

958
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
at the moment you wish to and it can't

959
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,440
be uh it can't be hacked by

960
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,079
uh by uh other

961
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,520
other uh by outside sources

962
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,800
um

963
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,680
uh

964
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,680
i picked up a piece uh addressing

965
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,839
uh the best secure smartphones of 2022.

966
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,800
uh there's the syrin labs

967
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,960
finney u1 and this is these are

968
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,599
extremely expensive products there is

969
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,359
something that boeing makes for the

970
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,520
intelligence community i believe it's

971
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,359
called the boeing black

972
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,400
and there is a bitum tough mobile 2

973
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
and the

974
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,480
a third one of these very expensive

975
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,359
phones there's the purism librium that's

976
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,599
the one with the with the um

977
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,760
with the kill switches interesting

978
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
technology but um

979
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
at the end of the day something that is

980
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,240
the the question really arises what

981
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
what can possibly

982
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,280
uh begin to compete with the big the big

983
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,400
carriers

984
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,680
and um

985
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,079
i thought that i had found it when i

986
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,960
discovered a company in germany

987
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
called vola

988
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,940
and um

989
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,599
[Music]

990
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,280
this is a phone that's based on an

991
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,200
android system

992
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,640
that claims to have been um

993
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,119
to have all the google apps removed from

994
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:45,920
it

995
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,800
excuse me yeah exactly an android

996
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,760
without the google which i i found hard

997
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,079
to comprehend but there is something to

998
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,280
comprehend please

999
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,640
i can't hear you

1000
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,598
that's what we do

1001
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,319
i still can't hear you you may need to

1002
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,720
drop the mask for just a moment yeah

1003
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,920
that's what we do at galex we also do

1004
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,800
android without google and you can do

1005
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
that because android is open source so

1006
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,520
you can just take whatever you want

1007
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,880
remove whatever you want and

1008
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,680
is that if you manage to hack a pixel if

1009
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
you manage to hack one of the android

1010
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,480
phones

1011
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,960
google

1012
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,280
very interesting and the beauty of

1013
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,359
having an android um device is that you

1014
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,599
can still download

1015
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,560
the

1016
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,079
um this company will uh will introduce

1017
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,560
you to the apps

1018
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,880
that are similar to the google apps but

1019
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
without the google

1020
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,000
condition

1021
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
um

1022
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,440
unfortunately these things are not made

1023
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,280
for the united states and this is a

1024
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,480
shortcoming and if they uh with a little

1025
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,400
bit of um

1026
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,640
a little bit of hacking these things can

1027
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,520
be

1028
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,400
um

1029
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,760
adapted to uh u.s networks

1030
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,880
or

1031
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,839
i i i believe this at this point i i've

1032
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,160
only run into one person who

1033
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,960
uh claimed to have been using it uh uh

1034
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,160
in the united states however i believe

1035
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,400
it it is within reach because of that

1036
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,280
one person and it'd be within reach

1037
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,319
if

1038
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,319
if a community of people were were

1039
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,359
working on it and um etc um

1040
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,800
say that again

1041
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,319
well

1042
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,599
actually um i experimented with this

1043
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,079
myself i tried to get it online

1044
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,720
and the company said go uh let's see

1045
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,440
t-mobile and another and another carrier

1046
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,640
called mint

1047
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,880
both can be accessible but they could

1048
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,640
not provide the instructions on how to

1049
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,000
do it so i kind of uh

1050
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,520
i'm in doubt about that um

1051
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,040
when when asked to um to document that

1052
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,119
anybody is operating one in the united

1053
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,880
states they failed to

1054
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,280
they they couldn't come up with one

1055
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,280
um

1056
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,560
and then there's another part of this

1057
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,319
the company

1058
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
the company didn't invest in an fcc

1059
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,720
license in the united states which is

1060
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,640
not going to block you from using the

1061
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,079
phone if you can

1062
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,640
move it or move around and and

1063
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,880
if you're good with um

1064
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,359
programming of these things

1065
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,400
however

1066
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,160
it actually looks like it has some

1067
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,280
potential

1068
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,400
if if a large group of people would have

1069
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,480
were to purchase these things

1070
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,760
and uh

1071
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,599
and uh

1072
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,839
and try to work things out and share

1073
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,440
their advances

1074
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,559
in in putting this to use and actually i

1075
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,119
thought that was uh

1076
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,520
the the possibility of that

1077
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,800
seemed to me

1078
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,119
to be about the best news that we've had

1079
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,640
in a long time uh and because

1080
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,480
it would be really helpful if a lot of

1081
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,400
people had phones that they could trust

1082
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,160
and that's why i

1083
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,960
tried to uh discuss the whole point of

1084
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,280
how dangerous it is to

1085
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,440
have a whole population walking around

1086
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,839
with uh

1087
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,040
with a spy in their pants

1088
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,770
so um

1089
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,960
[Music]

1090
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,800
that's pretty much the extent of this

1091
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,480
discussion i hope there may be another

1092
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,400
question or two if not

1093
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,000
um

1094
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,880
uh

1095
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,800
i actually i i'm i'm wondering if um

1096
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,599
if this sounds like an interesting op

1097
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,880
an interesting possibility um uh i was

1098
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,240
hoping to

1099
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,680
to see if there's uh a handful of people

1100
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,839
who are interested in investing

1101
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,079
in one of these handsets

1102
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,440
and um and uh working with the with the

1103
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,359
people out there

1104
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,880
who are

1105
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,920
uh programming these things and try to

1106
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
program them so that they work on one of

1107
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,559
the networks at least until

1108
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,720
the company in germany is in a position

1109
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,839
to invest a little bit more and catch up

1110
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,440
otherwise

1111
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,160
it may take

1112
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,240
quite a long time a number of years

1113
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,160
before these things are actually

1114
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,680
marketed in the united states

1115
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,240
well

1116
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,480
that is a good result i'm very happy to

1117
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,119
hear that would it be okay if we

1118
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,880
if we the people who are interested in

1119
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,359
that um

1120
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,079
and

1121
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,760
do these look like they will solve the

1122
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,640
problem that we've been discussing

1123
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,880
so let me come up and do that but in

1124
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,680
[Music]

1125
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,399
in any case

1126
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,079
my intention was to to try to

1127
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,839
introduce people to this if i didn't

1128
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,520
know it without being here today

1129
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,839
hopefully a few other people heard about

1130
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,920
it and um

1131
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,960
uh

1132
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,319
what what is really needed is that

1133
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,440
people

1134
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,839
start using these things and they start

1135
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,880
competing

1136
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
with the other companies that

1137
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
pretty much have

1138
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,160
a kind of a shared

1139
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,280
almost a monopoly on the market

1140
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,680
so uh

1141
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
uh

1142
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,160
refuses to be spied upon

1143
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,880
uh every morning when they get up uh 15

1144
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,800
minutes after they awaken

1145
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,559
all right well thank you very much thank

1146
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,000

[Applause]

1149
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,000

1150
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,400
