1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
how can reference and there's more stuff

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,280
going to be referenced as september 1st

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,200
here in the united states as legislation

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,640
and laws that are going to be driven by

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
regulators that crest will be managing

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,000
but the things that are really

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
interesting that you may want to

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
reference is just sure i'll take the

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,599
first one um if you are in the avionics

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,119
industry if you're flying planes if

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,240
you're doing satellite work if you're

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,439
doing things that are going to be tied

13
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,400
to human life on you know planes uh

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
there's a process there which is

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
considered critical or non-critical and

16
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
the regulators of the equivalent for

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
sure is what the faa is here in the

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,920
united states

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
and they require these organizations to

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
do the assessments to be able to have a

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
certain level of quality

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
seabest we manage the program for the

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,320
bank of england and we've done that

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
since 2006. so we manage a program for

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
the bank and all that communicate with

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
the bank of england and this helps those

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,239
organizations have assurance and quality

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
of services

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,559
ncsc right the national cyber security

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
center again another area for incident

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
response forensics being able to when a

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,400
buyer when a buyer has the most worst

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
day of their life and they have to go

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
ahead and reach out to get help because

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
they need assistance and getting

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
assistance after the fact is always

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,360
crazy right they have to know sort of

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,799
who are trusted service providers that

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,000
can help them

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and again our registrar helps those

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
organizations sort of get to the right

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,400
people

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
quickly

44
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
so again we have lots of different

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
regulatory items that we do for

46
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
governments regulatory bodies

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
and of course

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
measurements of standards which are

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
again consistent and very affordable

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
so the crest community continues to

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
evolve right we continue to sort of work

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
with academia we work with grassroots

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
efforts like hope right as a sponsor

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,439
here

55
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
we work with a lot of the universities

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
here in the states now to sort of

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,079
demonstrate what good looks like

58
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,520
we're doing some work with this nsa

59
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
center of excellences across the country

60
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
uh the goal here is to sort of help uh

61
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
set some some syllabuses and help inject

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
some quality items into these items that

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
are useful so when people come out of

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
university they can then get into

65
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
careers or get into jobs right both on

66
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
the defenders side and even on the uh

67
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
the service provider side

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,959
so

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
if you came in you may have seen two

70
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
things uh the first thing he came to the

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,920
door on is a little what is crest right

72
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
so a lot of what i just talked about is

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
here right but what was released today

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
uh is this document here which is useful

75
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
um

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
my day job uh is the cio for an

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,040
international law firm i spend a lot of

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
time working with lawyers i'm not a

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
lawyer uh but i know a lot of great

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
lawyers and i help them a lot of

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,599
technical components right like

82
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,720
interpreting

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
ip issues interpreting security issues

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
data breach issues etc

85
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
and a lot of the problems that they have

86
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
as attorneys of course is to in a court

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,519
of law determining you know where

88
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,200
liability falls

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
and crest has done a really great job

90
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
with trying to help align themselves

91
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
with that sort of conversation because

92
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
what is commercially reasonable security

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
i'm not sure anybody here can answer

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
that question clearly because most

95
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
organizations would need to do the

96
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,120
following they would need to pick a

97
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
framework that they want to measure

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
against they would need to then measure

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
against that framework with

100
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
organizations that have the experience

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,959
to do that sort of work they need to

102
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,480
report on that and then take those

103
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
corrective actions as needed and

104
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
demonstrate the process that they are

105
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
able to

106
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
you'll be commercially defensible

107
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
when organizations have problems because

108
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
everyone will everyone does

109
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
when there are situations that get

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
litigious with lawyers and no one likes

111
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
lawyers

112
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
but when you get into a situation of

113
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,040
pointing fingers saying well what have

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
you done to try to demonstrate your

115
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
organization's ability to secure the

116
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
code your rote code the code was

117
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
compromised resulted in loss resulted in

118
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
human human life

119
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
let's go back what did you do how did

120
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
you manage your code so if an

121
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
organization can come back to you and

122
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
say well we use the owasp asvs

123
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,920
version 4

124
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
we do a level 2 this allows us to take

125
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
these controls relative to the owasp

126
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
guidance for software security and we're

127
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
good to go because that's how we manage

128
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
our software development program

129
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
right you can manage and map to that

130
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
that may be useful in those

131
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
conversations if you get assessed to the

132
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
center of internet security version 8

133
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
and you use that as a methodology

134
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
fantastic if you're using national

135
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
cybersecurity framework you see where

136
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,519
i'm going there's there's items here

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
that businesses need to put the flag in

138
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
the ground and help manage too right

139
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
again crest is there to assist in that

140
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
process uh in the complicated cyber

141
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,160
security space

142
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
but in this document it's the crest

143
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
approved penetration tests or cap-t

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
which is uh interesting so what is a pen

145
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
test again doing this personally and

146
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
professionally for over 20 years from

147
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
source code analysis to threat modeling

148
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
et cetera

149
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
it's always different somebody says i

150
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
need a pen test you're like all right

151
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
well let's have that conversation what

152
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,600
are you looking to do what's your goal

153
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
well i want to do a code analysis of the

154
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
software is that a pen test or hey i

155
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
want you to scan the outside of my

156
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
company and see if a bad guy can get in

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
is that a pen test i want to send some

158
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
phishing emails and try to hook the

159
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
browser using beef is that a pen test

160
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
there's a couple things that you know we

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
need to clarify so trying to have that

162
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
laid out is very very helpful and it's

163
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
confusing for the industry and for the

164
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
folks that deliver services or products

165
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
in the industry to try to align some of

166
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
that vocabulary and i blame marketing

167
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
right i might blame marketing to have

168
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,919
these different terms and you throw the

169
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,680
ai word in there it gets real confusing

170
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
so it gets down to sort of competency

171
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
so the cap phases that are described in

172
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
the document are really important and

173
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,919
again we've been doing this for a long

174
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
long time so since 2006 this hasn't

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
really changed but it helps formalize it

176
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,000
in a document that can be referenced

177
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
right being able to scope being able to

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
do delivery being able to sign off and i

179
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
know our partner here will be speaking

180
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
about that so i won't steal his thunder

181
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
um but understanding that we have uh

182
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
recognized levels of individuals and you

183
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
might agree that there's lots of

184
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
different people in the room including

185
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
those with some gray hair in their

186
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
beards right so we have the idea of the

187
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the practitioner right the practitioner

188
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
has about a year experience you know

189
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
he's been doing is doing his homework

190
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,520
working real hard in the space and is

191
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
registered as a crest practitioner

192
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
there's a crest registered individual

193
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
that's got about you know three years of

194
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
experience verifiable he may have gone

195
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
out and taken oscp he may have done giac

196
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
he may have done some education work may

197
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
have done some hands-on but he can

198
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
demonstrate a certain level of expertise

199
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
and then they're certified which is

200
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
about five years of verifiable

201
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
experience those three things are very

202
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
helpful in trying to deliver

203
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
organizations to what they are asking

204
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
for independent space

205
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
also consistency again you may as an

206
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
organization if you're a consumer you

207
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
may require things in a quarterly basis

208
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
you may want things annual you may want

209
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
things in electronic format you may want

210
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
things in a certain process well what if

211
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
we laid out what reporting should look

212
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
like and what if that helped normalize

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
the industry because reporting

214
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
vulnerabilities reporting problems and

215
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
corrective action should be in a

216
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
consumable manner that people can use

217
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
so again i mentioned other organizations

218
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
and i want to call that out because i

219
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
said crest does accreditations

220
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,360
and yes we need to do some

221
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
certifications as well but

222
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
accreditations is really what's

223
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
important in the bigger picture of crest

224
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
because we're really helping the

225
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
normalize the international space for

226
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
cyber

227
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
and we recognize and we embrace a lot of

228
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
our peers right our peer organizations

229
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
that are doing certifications

230
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,000
accreditations right across the water

231
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
here we have our new york university

232
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
folks that do you know seesaw st john's

233
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
does a fantastic job in our cyber

234
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
security program each of the different

235
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
organizations brings something to the

236
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
table and we're really trying to help

237
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
map that and measure that to what good

238
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
looks like and what's repeatable so with

239
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
that i'd like to take the time to

240
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
introduce one of the crest members one

241
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,599
of the crest partners

242
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
this organization has been with crest

243
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
for a number of years and i had nobody

244
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
better to speak to what his pen test

245
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,560
program looks like than one of the pen

246
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,800
testers let me just swap over guys

247
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,960
thank you

248
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,519
[Music]

249
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
there we go all right so uh

250
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
first of all thanks tom for having us

251
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
here sharing the table with you

252
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,440
i'm going to give

253
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,479
an introduction of myself very spread

254
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,400
and how we approach the

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
cipt

256
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,199
specification

257
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
with a real case study of a recent

258
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,730
engagement that we completed

259
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,240
[Music]

260
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
that's the agenda basically

261
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
um so i'm the leader of the offensive

262
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,279
security practice at verse sprite i go

263
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
by wacko which is easier than the dragon

264
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
i have um plus 15 years of experience

265
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
doing pen testing

266
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
so verse plate is a global

267
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
security firm

268
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
it has a global presence i have my team

269
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
spread in barcelona buenos aires there's

270
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,640
people in atlanta people in romania

271
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
we are crest accredited

272
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,399
as tom said for a couple of years now

273
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
we are offensive minded

274
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
but with

275
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
a focus on risk actually our ceo is the

276
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,760
author of the pasta framework which is

277
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
a thread modeling framework that puts

278
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
customer at the center of the scene

279
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
and gives context to everything that we

280
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,839
find

281
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,320
there's uh

282
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
there are certain cases where maybe

283
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,800
technically an issue can be considered

284
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
critical because it is nice you could do

285
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
maybe run code on a on a server and what

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
not but in reality for the business it's

287
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
not that urgent maybe to go and and take

288
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
care of that so uh we use pasta to give

289
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,240
context to everything that we do

290
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
so um yes i was saying uh i've been been

291
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,200
testing since

292
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
i was 18 years old i think

293
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
and i can definitely say as tom was

294
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
commenting before the definition of

295
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
apprentice is

296
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
right now broader than ever i could say

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,440
there's no single definition there's no

298
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
one that can actually

299
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
say

300
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
or define for everyone what a pentas is

301
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
we even have as tom said i mean

302
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,760
marketing created this nice uh thing

303
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,279
here

304
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
telling customers or potential deals how

305
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,399
we interpret each of the many services

306
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,760
right vulnerability assessment

307
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
penetration testing red teaming each one

308
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,200
with their own testing methodology

309
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
each one targeting different targets

310
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
but despite having this kind of broad uh

311
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
interpretation of what an exercise could

312
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,040
look like

313
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
uh i think and and i i i'm gonna use a

314
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,720
quote from one of our customers that i

315
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
think was quite nice

316
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
to do a recap on everything here

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's about the process behind the

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,519
methodologies

319
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
and that's what actually the

320
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
specification for cipt comes to solve

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
right the the process i focus on the

322
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
process for scoping the process for

323
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
delivery or the execution of the

324
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
engagement as well as the signing off of

325
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,560
the

326
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
of the testing so with that i wanted to

327
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,279
um

328
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,920
bring a case study of a real engagement

329
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
we completed

330
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
customer was calling these when they

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
reach out a cloud security operational

332
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
assurance

333
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
for acme i'm using acme here

334
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,320
and um basically i mean the word

335
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
assurance was there so we knew that

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
customer was gonna most likely be using

337
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
this to show they are doing things right

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
they are being diligent

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
and they may be also be using this for

340
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
regulation purposes because customer was

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
coming from a

342
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
healthcare industry right so

343
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
we already knew

344
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,760
this was

345
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
serious matter you know i mean

346
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
there was going to be people taking a

347
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
look at the results so uh we wanted to

348
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
do um our best along the entire three

349
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
three phases that we have here

350
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
and

351
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
the first thing that we have to do is to

352
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
talk to the customer as tom said i mean

353
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
you're calling this a cloud security

354
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
operational assurance so what do you

355
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
mean by that right what's the scope of

356
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
work what what are the goals what are

357
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
the objectives would you have in mind

358
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
right what you're gonna be using this

359
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,639
for so

360
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
um

361
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
when talking to the customer uh we

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
define a couple of things we identify

363
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,600
they

364
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
were looking to assess the overall

365
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,279
infrastructure but with a big focus on

366
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,519
on the cloud portion

367
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
they were looking for adversarial

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,720
exercise exercises so we already knew um

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,399
we would take kind of a red teaming

370
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,560
approach here they were not willing to

371
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
share any information so definitely a

372
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
black box approach more of a red teaming

373
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
not so much of a pen test

374
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
we were

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,959
free to actually touch on everything

376
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,480
that was public so the targets could uh

377
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
vary a lot i mean they were talking

378
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
about public infrastructure but we also

379
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
found that they had uh mobile apps in

380
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
the stores that we could take a look at

381
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,079
and so on so um brought the scope here

382
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
um they were also looking to determine

383
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
how we could abuse everything that could

384
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
be found publicly

385
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
via ocean or some other means

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
and then we discussed about some rules

387
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
of engagement which are quite important

388
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,519
they wanted daily updates obviously

389
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
specifically around critical findings

390
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
and

391
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
they were not looking as to do any kind

392
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
of extraction during the proof of

393
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,399
concept for post-exploitation they were

394
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
just looking for us to show the

395
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,199
um potentiality of the the issues

396
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
of course as with every single

397
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
engagement avoid at all cost disruption

398
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
of services because we were testing

399
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
production

400
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
so that's good i would say that's normal

401
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
nowadays

402
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
so um once we knew what was what this

403
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,040
was about

404
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
um we started working on the team

405
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
assignment

406
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,600
um

407
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
we really needed skilled people

408
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
not only during the scoping process

409
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,040
which i was part of

410
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
also courtney here from sales and

411
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
the way we work with the team was

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
having a principal

413
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
security consultant leading the whole

414
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,399
engagement

415
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
and this was a teamwork because of the

416
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
size of the scope and the time we had to

417
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
do the work

418
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
so we then assigned a senior consultant

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,760
a security consultant i was overseeing

420
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
the entire engagement along with a team

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
lead there's a pm project manager and we

422
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
also have a client success manager and

423
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
we work as a team during the whole

424
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
stages of the project lifecycle which

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,639
i'm gonna tell a little bit about now um

426
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
so this is the process right i was

427
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,639
talking about um

428
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,079
no matter the methodology that you

429
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,680
follow the process is key here

430
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
and everything starts i mean once the

431
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
sow is signed

432
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
everything starts with a

433
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
preparation time

434
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
uh there's a kickoff call that takes

435
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,839
place

436
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
we'll review everything that was agreed

437
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,399
on

438
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,680
there's an initial ocean for us to see

439
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
maybe if we can

440
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,079
purchase a type of domain or do

441
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,360
something that needs a certain time of

442
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
maturity after

443
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
uh before going to use it

444
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,639
we do a quick risk based analysis

445
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,240
trying to

446
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,360
learn more about the customer

447
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,839
main business use cases

448
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
vendors that they have

449
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
a little bit about the size of the

450
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,639
company and whatnot and we always

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
obviously do the initial setup of the

452
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
attack service

453
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
then we go into the kickoff uh where we

454
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
send the kickoff email detailing all the

455
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
things that we agreed

456
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,600
we go into uh this uh pasta framework

457
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
taking a look at different stages of it

458
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,040
um

459
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,079
we do the ocean and recon

460
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
and then we go into the in-flight uh

461
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,399
phase where we are basically doing the

462
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
the entire methodology for whatever we

463
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,240
are testing right uh here the targets uh

464
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,079
were quite different

465
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
uh we had apis we had web applications

466
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
we have mobile applications we have

467
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
cloud infrastructure so each one of

468
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
those good you use a different

469
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
methodology when it comes for testing

470
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
but more or less it was like the phone

471
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,839
assessment the manual testing and phone

472
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
analysis exploitation post exploitation

473
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
and then reporting

474
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
there's a winding down phase where we

475
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
work on documenting everything that we

476
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
did

477
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
on the report

478
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,079
we also tell about the attempted attacks

479
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,199
maybe

480
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,519
some observations that didn't end up as

481
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,240
an issue but are worth mentioning

482
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,400
we have a wrap-up uh

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,679
stage

484
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
and when we have this clean up process

485
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
as well we don't want to keep anything

486
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
about the customer once we complete the

487
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,199
testing

488
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
and then we have the closing

489
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
with the closing we deliver the report

490
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,559
we go into technical debrief for this

491
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
particular exercise there was also an

492
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
executive debrief

493
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,760
and there's a retest coordination and

494
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,559
then

495
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,480
the customer sacrifice satisfaction

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,400
follow up

497
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
so

498
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,240
um

499
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,080
i'd like to show you about um one of the

500
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
attack patterns and especially we are

501
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
going to be

502
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
taking a look at

503
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
how the methodology works on this area

504
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
and then we're going to have a demo so

505
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,799
to give you some context

506
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,160
um

507
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
first with ocean

508
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
we discovered an android mobile app that

509
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
we reviewed

510
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
and we found an end point that we had

511
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
missed during the oceans

512
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
it was it was quite shady it was just

513
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
being used for user statistics

514
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
statistics

515
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
so with this new endpoint we then do

516
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
some further recon

517
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,960
uh we tried to brute force directories

518
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,559
and paths and we found three new

519
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,760
endpoints

520
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
from from this host

521
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
one of those had a js file

522
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
and that we

523
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
statically review manually review

524
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
we were trying to find more

525
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
endpoints

526
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
and we finally found three that were

527
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,600
that caught our attention i'm going to

528
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,480
show you

529
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,080
in a sec

530
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,320
and for one of those when we went to um

531
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,440
i can show you here for um so basically

532
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
we have here i don't know if you can see

533
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
that uh we decompile the the android app

534
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
we

535
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
took a look at the

536
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
the java

537
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
code

538
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
we found

539
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,320
we

540
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
refused some of the endpoints that we

541
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
found here and then finally came across

542
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
these three

543
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
endpoints that caught our attention

544
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
for one of those

545
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
that

546
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,720
was the rest api invoked teams

547
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
when we were calling that with no

548
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
credentials because this was blackbox

549
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
and we didn't have any so far

550
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
there was a stack trace

551
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
that caught our attention because

552
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
basically we were seeing a token an

553
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
authorization bearer

554
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
for an

555
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,440
endpoint that was saying

556
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,160
graph.microsoft.com

557
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
so

558
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,559
what we did was

559
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,200
like okay what's microsoft graph and i'm

560
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
going to read this literally because

561
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
this was insane

562
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,760
the google search was saying

563
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,480
that ms graph is the gateway

564
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
to the data and intelligence in m0365

565
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,360
and this is nice it provides

566
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,679
a unified programmatically model which

567
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
is basically a rest api

568
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
um that you can use to access the

569
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
tremendous amount of data in microsoft

570
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
365.

571
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
okay so that that was

572
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,520
uh certainly something interesting and

573
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
i'm gonna show you um

574
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,440
we tried to recreate the the issue here

575
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
and i'm not doing a live demo because

576
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
they don't always end up good but we

577
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
have this recorded

578
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
to show you a little bit about what we

579
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
were able to achieve with this

580
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,600
um here you can see the rest api

581
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,720
being called with no credentials

582
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
there's a stack trace

583
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,919
on this staging environment

584
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,200
which basically

585
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
looked like

586
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,039
it had some kind of trust relationship

587
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
with whatever was in production because

588
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
there was a talking there so naturally

589
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we want to see what's what's in the

590
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
token and what kind of uh roles or

591
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
privileges

592
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,159
it supports

593
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,080
and we have a bunch of them

594
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,039
right

595
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,640
there's um a sites with all user with

596
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,120
all mail sent

597
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
uh call initiate

598
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,720
um there's there was even um an option

599
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
to read uh

600
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
all the teams chat for any user

601
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
crazy

602
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,919
so

603
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
here we are trying to learn about how to

604
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
call the ms graph we were not sure at

605
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,799
that time

606
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,159
i mean

607
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
how big the ms graph was and the amount

608
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
of data that it could contain so

609
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
we are here trying to see how we

610
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,320
create the request and try to use that

611
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
token

612
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
this one in particular is to list users

613
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
on that tenant

614
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
for the tenant

615
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,840
asia id tenant

616
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
and of course we are adding the token

617
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
that we found on the stack trace

618
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
and there you have it i mean

619
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,400
it was an station app that was

620
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
disclosing this token on a stack trace

621
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,280
and it had this huge trust relationship

622
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
with their own

623
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,479
o365 environment

624
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,640
we now

625
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,440
have the users each user has a user id

626
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
and with that we will be able to use

627
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
or to call some of the other methods

628
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
here in the demo we are showing just a

629
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
few of them

630
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,640
there's one here that you can use to

631
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
list

632
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,280
anything that that user has on their one

633
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
drive drives

634
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,679
and there's another example that we then

635
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
used

636
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,679
to expand the the exercise because

637
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
basically we found a way to send emails

638
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,440
directly from this rest api

639
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
um

640
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,280
impersonating any user basically on

641
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
azure id so

642
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
it was crazy

643
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
so here we are trying to see how to

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,840
create the entire

645
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,679
request and get one file as a proof of

646
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,320
concept basically

647
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,039
the interesting thing here was that

648
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
the um

649
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
the response was given

650
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
a direct url

651
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,840
that you could use to grab that file

652
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
and

653
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
you could just put that on a browser and

654
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
it would download the file for you here

655
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,440
that's the name of the file

656
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,720
and this rest api was giving that for

657
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
free

658
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,039
we are using the excel report that like

659
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,520
looks more cheesy

660
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
there you go

661
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,559
so couple of things here um

662
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,039
uh that i want to talk on while the the

663
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,039
next proof of concept is how we uh

664
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
managed to send emails impersonating any

665
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,320
user on their own 365.

666
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,159
um

667
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
challenges um obviously this was a broad

668
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,919
attack surface so many different

669
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,840
methodologies that we used during the

670
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
engagement

671
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
uh having a defined process tested

672
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
process right that focused on

673
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
all these three main areas scoping

674
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,360
obviously if if this hadn't been scoped

675
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
correctly we wouldn't have the time

676
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
to uh do things properly right because

677
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
the scope was quite broad and large

678
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,440
um

679
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
this project like life cycle

680
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,640
that

681
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
ensures the

682
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
the whole engagement is delivered

683
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,880
accordingly and then obviously the way

684
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
you present all of these right because

685
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
you have to connect a lot of points

686
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
um

687
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,720
that was a a big challenge um

688
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
then also i mean despite we have

689
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,520
a clear defined project life cycle you

690
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,279
still have to account for

691
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
any surprises during the engagement

692
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,360
um

693
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,000
here what happened was that we had to

694
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
immediately immediately informed the

695
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,919
customer about what was going on

696
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,520
obviously this was production and we

697
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
found this with no information

698
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,039
whatsoever so it was out there for

699
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,559
anyone to exploit

700
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,520
and they asked us to pause the the

701
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,080
testing uh they did some remediation

702
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
they wanted to make sure that this

703
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,360
wasn't

704
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
exploited before

705
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,000
and then we could uh continue so

706
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,120
accounting for many for maybe roadblocks

707
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
or hiccups that's also important keeping

708
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
a fluent communication with the customer

709
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
across all faces

710
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,120
that's that's key

711
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
so

712
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,960
this is the

713
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
the last proof of concept where we are

714
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,440
sending an email impersonating one of

715
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,240
those

716
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,559
issue id accounts for our customers

717
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,879
there you go

718
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:40,920
so

719
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,279
[Music]

720
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
that that was a demo and yeah i just

721
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
wanted to show you i mean

722
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,799
um

723
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
despite being framed within the cipd

724
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,679
specification that doesn't mean

725
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
that you cannot do cool stuff right i

726
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,320
mean this is not boring stuff at all

727
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,120
and

728
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,000
you do need this kind of specification

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
when it comes to doing a student's

730
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,279
activity so yeah so so so thank you for

731
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,400
that thank you

732
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
[Applause]

733
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,039
uh no we're good

734
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
so so again i think that you know one

735
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
thing that that speaks to is the example

736
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,000
of it's not a movie right like it takes

737
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
time to look at the controls relative to

738
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,039
an organization being assessed it takes

739
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
people that have the knowledge and

740
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,120
experience to do the testing and you

741
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
know the crest layout of what good

742
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
should look like to the end buyer

743
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
is very helpful in all organizations

744
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,399
sort of forming a process that's

745
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,720
somewhat repeatable to demonstrate how

746
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
that

747
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,000
technical example becomes a reality for

748
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
everybody in a room i'd like to play a

749
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
quick game it's the same game we

750
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,559
actually played in 2010 at hope

751
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,399
but i think you might get some giggles

752
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,360
out of it

753
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,159
so

754
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,919
imagine for a moment that you walk into

755
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
a room okay what i want is i want people

756
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,919
to shout out the answers as quickly as

757
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,120
possible i'm going to give you a short

758
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
amount of time to do that you walk into

759
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
a room and there's a light bulb the

760
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
light bulb's in the middle of the room

761
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
there's a switch on the wall but you're

762
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
not allowed to touch the switch

763
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,840
how do you shut the light bulb off go

764
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,039
there you go so you know we've had

765
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,120
feedback about pellet guns have somebody

766
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
else do it uh maybe shut off the power

767
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
don't pay your bill throw a rock at it

768
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,679
right there's all different ways to

769
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,279
approach the same goal and i think

770
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,760
that's really the spirit of what we do

771
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
in the space of security right we we

772
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,399
look at what i call loose approaches and

773
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,159
say okay so here's kind of what we're

774
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,200
going to do we're going to walk in and

775
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,159
we're going to assess we're going to

776
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,039
look we're going to make sure we're

777
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,799
approved to do those type of things now

778
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,559
let's go deal with the right guys so

779
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
however the end goal is reached that's

780
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
sort of one of the very important parts

781
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
of the penetration testing side but

782
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,600
you'd imagine if you're on the other

783
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
side of that and you had a really bad

784
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
day and you had instant responders walk

785
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,559
through the door you're looking for them

786
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,679
to save your ass right you're looking

787
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,120
for them to give you answers to

788
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
questions and help you identify where

789
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,159
the problem was so you don't really have

790
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,360
a lot of time to waste you don't really

791
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
have a lot of time for you know them to

792
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,440
figure it out you want sort of the best

793
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,760
and brightest to go do the job so as we

794
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
look at you know that sort of piece

795
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,679
again just pulling back to what crest is

796
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,440
all about right on the back of your

797
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
program guide you know it has a little

798
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
summary of what crest is

799
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
i for those that haven't heard about us

800
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,039
i wish you taken an opportunity to learn

801
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,039
more about what crest does if you're a

802
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,720
buyer if you're a service provider if

803
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,120
you're academia or if you're looking to

804
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
you know go on your career journey

805
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
you know we have a lot of opportunities

806
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,159
and a lot of member companies that have

807
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
you know internships and jobs

808
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,159
so it really becomes sort of a holistic

809
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,480
approach within the community to try to

810
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
make things a better place so with that

811
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
um if there are any questions about

812
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,000
crest or penetration testing in

813
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
particular

814
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
or the the crest approved penetration

815
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,840
test specification i'll be happy to uh

816
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,279
to answer that and i know there might be

817
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,520
some maybe questions online we're also

818
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,080
in a nice cool air-conditioned supporter

819
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
area over by the registration booth so

820
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,600
once the talk's over please feel free to

821
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
stop by and say hi

822
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
um back to denise is there any questions

823
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,799
from your side

824
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,439
excellent

825
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
so please with certainly

826
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,320
lots of

827
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,399
resources to to talk about any uh

828
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,520
questions that you may have we'd be

829
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
happy to answer them

830
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
i'll give you our opinions again there's

831
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
lots of tools out there that we can

832
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
recommend a lot of them but obviously

833
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,159
into i always say my wife i can't paint

834
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,000
the house or fix the fix the door but if

835
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,039
you're walking to home depot there's a

836
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
whole row of tools

837
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,159
tools don't make anything happen right

838
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
it's the intelligence behind the tool

839
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,720
sir

840
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,760
question for wacko

841
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
this demo was good but what are the

842
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
actual deliverables that you produce for

843
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,360
the

844
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,320
c-level executives at that firm to the

845
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,480
end client that is not as technically

846
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,240
savvy as most of the crowd probably

847
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,039
would be here this is all good for us

848
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,559
how do you take that what's the

849
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,480
methodology what are the deliverables

850
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,039
and different final results that you

851
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,600
give to them on that level basically so

852
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,360
there's two pieces there

853
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,559
from from the service provider

854
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,559
perspective his opinion or his answer is

855
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,679
going to be the right one for his

856
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,960
company

857
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
in the guidance that is available for

858
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
you crest does outline what that good

859
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
look does look like for the purposes of

860
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
mapping it to the purpose of being able

861
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,399
to feed it up to be

862
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,279
uh be able to be demonstrating due

863
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,720
diligence due care

864
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
at the end of the day

865
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
your reports may be slightly different

866
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,960
so please speak to that

867
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,799
but the goal with all the crest

868
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,240
assessments is to follow somewhat of a

869
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
standard process so that they're

870
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,200
consistent and that's the issue the

871
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
breadth of it

872
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,519
yes yeah now that that's a good question

873
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,799
obviously

874
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
this was a technical demo um the way we

875
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
present um the issues on the report

876
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
basically we we do have two main

877
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
sections three main sections i would say

878
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
on our report uh there's an executive

879
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,640
summary where we um

880
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,840
we speak at a level that can be

881
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,480
understood by anyone there's like no

882
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,679
deep technical uh wording there

883
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,919
um then we do have a technical detail

884
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,240
section and the last one is for every

885
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,799
attempted attacks and maybe observations

886
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
on the executive summary

887
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,080
the way we try to convey ideas is from

888
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
this

889
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,880
business risk perspective and to give

890
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,760
actionable items so there's a i mean

891
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
after we go through the the past

892
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
methodology and the risk-based uh thread

893
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,399
modeling there's a risk analysis that we

894
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,039
do at the end so we give to the customer

895
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,919
like hey you know what i mean

896
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,080
we tried to summarize everything that

897
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,120
happened here at a higher level so

898
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,039
you had um

899
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,440
basically a station

900
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,919
server that was public

901
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,000
and it had a trust relationship with

902
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
your asian id it wasn't been tested so

903
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,679
we tried to let them know

904
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,159
when they are not doing that good you

905
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,760
know like giving actionable items uh we

906
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
also say where they where they are where

907
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,559
we tested and they they were doing right

908
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,120
okay so that's the idea that we have

909
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,080
when it comes to the executive summary

910
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,360
and if that answer your your questions

911
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
yeah yeah so so that that is probably

912
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,399
the the number one um problem for the

913
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,200
buyer right is getting consistent output

914
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
and if they have a regulated need to

915
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,880
comply or provide data reports then uh

916
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
digestible format which is similar is

917
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
very important and also each of the

918
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,320
different service providers we have

919
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,159
about 300 of them by the way worldwide

920
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,760
currently

921
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
as we

922
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,799
make strong recommendations for a

923
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
process to be followed

924
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,240
you might agree then it becomes sort of

925
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
soft touch as well service providers

926
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,919
should be doing a soft touch out to

927
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,360
brief you know debriefing with their

928
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,440
client should be making sure that their

929
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,279
um the check signer

930
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,200
is very clear as to some of the goals

931
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,559
and probably even along the way the

932
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,080
threat modeling piece that was mentioned

933
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,679
what's the dollar value of the impact

934
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,200
right so we can kind of bring it back to

935
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,599
there um most of us that do technical

936
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,119
work right we're kind of in our own

937
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
world we don't really care about that

938
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
right so it's like here's a technical

939
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,239
report you know go fix that then there's

940
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,159
another another layer usually the other

941
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,599
layers okay so what was the impact of

942
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,879
this how does it really affect your

943
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,399
business and then sort of doing the

944
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,800
downstream effect so um so crest

945
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
definitely calls those items out for our

946
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
organizations to

947
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,760
address and again we do our best to help

948
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
level up the organizations now

949
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,879
one thing that's a suggestion uh is

950
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,000
if you do happen to go to the crest

951
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,239
website uh which and you do look at the

952
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,440
member list of companies which is

953
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,320
completely free to the buyer right um

954
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
you're going to come up with a list of

955
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
organizations some of them you may know

956
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
by brand by name right so there's a lot

957
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,719
of great companies um

958
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
when you inquire with them you need to

959
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,000
be very clear

960
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,839
if you're looking for a pen test

961
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,079
you're looking for a crest pen test

962
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,599
the reason why i say that very clearly

963
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,240
is because every member of the crest

964
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
organization that provides services

965
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
that's accredited and certified has a

966
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,280
crest id

967
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
and many organizations will provide a

968
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
pen test or a crest pen test so my point

969
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,119
is no you know buyer needs to understand

970
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,320
some of those things as to what they're

971
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,000
looking for and then of course crest

972
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,520
does get involved as any sort of

973
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,839
contract issues any sort of issues with

974
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,079
these deliver deliverability of the

975
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,400
information and we serve as a mediator

976
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,760
right because we are the accreditation

977
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,359
body the

978
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,720
best thing that we can do for the buyer

979
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
is help quickly

980
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,079
solve issues that are going to be

981
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,560
popping up between buyer and seller and

982
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,240
for the service company if they are

983
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,079
grossly negligent they will be removed

984
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,000
from the accreditation list and then

985
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
they will be globally removed from those

986
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,359
procurement opportunities which is

987
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,200
usually significant for them so there's

988
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,760
a win-win for people to work together uh

989
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,480
hopefully that answers the question

990
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,359
sir

991
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,000
so i

992
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,240
yes also but i am curious and i think

993
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,079
this will be valuable for everybody else

994
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,720
in the audience is do you have any stats

995
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,200
on the percentage of organizations that

996
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,759
come to the accrediteds

997
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,000
do you have any stats to really show you

998
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,839
know the number of organizations that

999
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,040
come to crest to be accredited but are

1000
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
unfortunately turned down because they

1001
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,079
don't meet requirements and i think that

1002
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,079
would really demonstrate to the audience

1003
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,640
how valuable and strict the crest

1004
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,320
requirements really are

1005
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
in you know making the cyber world more

1006
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,920
secure

1007
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,320
sure um so so the organization does

1008
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,480
produce that material um as an

1009
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
accreditation body our group is not a

1010
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,800
we're not an audit pass fail type of

1011
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
organization right we're there for an

1012
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,400
organization to understand what they're

1013
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
going to be measured against have them

1014
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
submit their materials have a

1015
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,400
organization get audited and come up

1016
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,720
with a answer to the question of are you

1017
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
doing commercially reasonable standards

1018
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,200
so when there's deficiencies uh our

1019
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
crest team which is like 50 of us around

1020
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,880
the world uh we focus on helping that

1021
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
organization understand where some of

1022
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
the deficiencies are if you have the

1023
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
greatest pen testers in the world that's

1024
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
fantastic if your back office is a mess

1025
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
that's a problem right if you have a

1026
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,880
greatest pen taxes in the world and

1027
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
you're not securing client data you

1028
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,520
don't have good contracts you don't have

1029
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,119
appropriate controls in place that's a

1030
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,760
problem so we would basically reject the

1031
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,160
application and point out where the

1032
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,680
problems may be and that they can go

1033
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,160
ahead and fix those and resubmit

1034
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
the point is to have everyone sort of

1035
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
level up and that's kind of where we

1036
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,839
take the regulatory approach of what

1037
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,960
we're doing for regulators and

1038
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
governments and say these are the

1039
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
programs that have been managed that we

1040
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
manage on their behalf

1041
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,640
in order for you to be on that program

1042
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,240
that's how it works right it's kind of

1043
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,599
like here in new york if you ever

1044
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,040
running on the new york state contract

1045
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,560
as an example there's certain things you

1046
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
got to do why because new york says so

1047
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,400
great if you apply and you don't meet

1048
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,839
the requirements you may not be on that

1049
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,760
contract or you have a certain amount of

1050
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,079
time to sort of meet that meet that goal

1051
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,800
but from a perspe perspective of numbers

1052
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,520
i would say at any given time there's a

1053
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,760
hundred or so applications and those

1054
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
organizations are typically getting

1055
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
coached along the way until they're able

1056
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,119
to mature and then be able to be on that

1057
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,520
list also they're reassessed

1058
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,040
so individuals are reassessed every

1059
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,800
three years for competency

1060
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
organizations are reviewed every year

1061
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,960
right they have a business review

1062
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
any significant change to the business

1063
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
acquisition changes people in the

1064
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,400
organization those those type of things

1065
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,320
may result in the organization no longer

1066
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
being on the approved list

1067
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,200
also

1068
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
organizations like yours

1069
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,200
are

1070
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,400
potentially global

1071
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,160
uh they're accredited by region so

1072
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
there's a global accreditation and

1073
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,119
there's regional accreditation so

1074
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,320
organizations that want to crest

1075
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
accredited assessment here in the united

1076
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,359
states from your company as an example

1077
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,640
your company would need to be across the

1078
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
credit company in the u.s make sense so

1079
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
that's sort of how that all flows out uh

1080
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
it's super important to um you know just

1081
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,760
understand uh what chris gives to you

1082
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
the consumer or the buyer to protect the

1083
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,839
end customer which ultimately is for

1084
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,160
privacy and security so it's sort of a

1085
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,240
you're trying to help level up uh as a

1086
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,320
as a helping hand in the space hopefully

1087
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
that answers your question

1088
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
cool

1089
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,280
sir hi thanks uh i'm a practitioner this

1090
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
is my first hearing about crest so uh

1091
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,880
thanks for sharing that uh my question

1092
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
maybe is to uh wakeem a bit when you

1093
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,440
found that credential was there guidance

1094
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,119
in the cab t that that was going to be a

1095
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,079
critical finding and uh to was there any

1096
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,240
guidance about how to handle that like i

1097
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,000
noticed you kind of tried to explore the

1098
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,079
capability of that credential was that

1099
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,920
the correct approach or should you have

1100
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,280
gone back to the client right away and

1101
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
said hey i have a credential

1102
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,119
what's it all about

1103
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,000
yeah yeah that's a good question

1104
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,880
um when we saw

1105
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
the potential things that we could do i

1106
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
mean we

1107
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
actually had to test them i mean

1108
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,560
when we tell the customer and we're

1109
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,839
going to let them know about something

1110
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,079
critical we cannot go with a false

1111
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,920
positive you know

1112
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
so

1113
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,160
as

1114
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,800
we graph a working proof of concept

1115
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
and we understand what the impact is

1116
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
because we have done this previous uh

1117
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,359
threat modeling on their business

1118
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,920
and we can share that with some context

1119
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
you know um

1120
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
so

1121
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,640
validating the credential would be the

1122
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,760
appropriate yeah yeah yeah yeah we we

1123
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
needed to do that i mean

1124
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,200
um

1125
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,520
because we couldn't go with again a

1126
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
false positive or a false sense of maybe

1127
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,319
criticality

1128
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,400
lends itself to the maturity of the

1129
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
organization requesting the requirement

1130
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,319
so the it's two two-sided right and

1131
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,160
you're in a practitioner you get this if

1132
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,359
the service provider is going to speak

1133
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,040
to their client about how they would

1134
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,359
prefer to do the work and the buyer is

1135
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,480
interested in that and there might be

1136
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
some conversation there um i know from

1137
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
fire and forget sort of offensive

1138
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,000
testing right i'm very much focused on

1139
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,599
okay am i approved for this am i

1140
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,800
approved for that am i proof of this

1141
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,960
proof of that yes fire on target go so

1142
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,200
as long as we understand what the

1143
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,359
terms are we're good commercial sector a

1144
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,880
little bit more fuzzy obviously the

1145
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
government sector has a little bit more

1146
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,800
gates to cross so we bring those worlds

1147
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,079
together a little bit give a little bit

1148
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,839
of what good looks like and people can

1149
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,720
operate thanks for the context thanks

1150
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,560
i think we are just about at a time but

1151
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,480
