00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,599
involved with hope and i also spoke as

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,040
an expert witness in the assange

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
extradition trial

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,319
i

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
uh of some relevance actually have an

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,080
upcoming book on the espionage act that

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,599
i spent years co-authoring called the

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,360
century repression and it's the first

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
comprehensive political and legal

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,319
history written on the law so if

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,680
anybody's interested in pre-ordering

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
that i also have some promo codes up

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
here that you can come and grab after

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519
the talk

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,480
so

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
kind of taking a step back

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
this talk is a reprice

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
of one that jessalyn and i gave back at

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
hope in 2016.

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,599
and

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
the world was a lot different

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
back then of course we spoke about the

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,120
espionage act

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
we spoke about the cfaa

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but we didn't think

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
that things would be getting this bad

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
donald trump was on the campaign trail

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
and of course as we know

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
he assumed the presidency and continued

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
the war on whistleblowers and

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
journalists in an extremely aggressive

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
fashion

97
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,799
since then of course julian assange

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,440
was charged by the doj and is facing an

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
extradition trial in london

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
so we hope to give some updates

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
on these cases

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
as well as the next steps and william

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
has been doing excellent and amazing

104
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,519
work

105
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
on legislative efforts to try to reform

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
and hopefully repeal the espionage act

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
so what i'll do just briefly is give an

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,879
overview of the espionage act of 1917

109
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,480
some of the political and historical

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
context and then i'll pass it off to

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
jessalyn and william to talk about some

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
of the the next steps

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
so the espionage act was passed in 1917

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
actually the original description of it

115
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,360
was a law to punish acts of interference

116
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
with the foreign relations the

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
neutrality and the foreign commerce of

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,120
the united states

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
to punish espionage and to better

120
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
enforce the criminal laws of the united

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
states for other purposes and what's

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
really interesting is from the very

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
beginning this law was designed to try

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
to punish

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
interference with foreign relations

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,160
which in today's age is equated with

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
whistleblowing

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
it broadly punishes the receipt the

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
retention and communication of quote

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
national defense information

131
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
today it's the key law used to prosecute

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,880
government whistleblowers and

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
importantly even though it's called the

134
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
espionage act its use is not limited to

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
spies by any means it can apply to

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
government employees

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
members of the general public

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
journalists

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,400
even non-us citizens

140
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
so when we talk about the dissemination

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
of national defense information

142
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,280
the question you might ask is

143
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
that national defense information that

144
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
sounds like important stuff

145
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,800
but it does not mean

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
military secrets codes or closely

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
guarded information

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
does not need to be classified

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
and it can include and in many cases has

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
included evidence of torture

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
war crimes corruption or government

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
criminality that has been used in

153
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
international civil and criminal court

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
proceedings

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
so dialing back this this law was passed

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
during world war one to limit opposition

157
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
to the war

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
and what's important to realize about

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
the espionage act is that its whole

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,360
history is heavily political and in fact

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
it was passed during the most one of the

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
most vibrant political periods in the

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
history of the us

164
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
and provided criminal penalties for

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
anyone obstructing enlistment in the

166
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
armed forces or causing insubordination

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
or disloyalty in military or naval

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
forces

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
it was actually amended in 1918 to

170
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
include a sedition act which was then

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
repealed and is also amended numerous

172
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,759
times interestingly expanded its biggest

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
expansion happened in 1950 at the height

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,080
of mccarthyism

175
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
one of the provisions that i'll focus on

176
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
is section 793-e which is the one that's

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
most implicated in prosecutions of

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
government whistleblowers and now in

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
potentially members of the general

180
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
and it punishes anyone who willfully

181
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
communicates

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
national information related to the

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
national defense to any person not

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
entitled to receive it

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
and the penalty can include a fine and

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,240
imprisonment of up to 10 years and in

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,199
espionage cases what we typically see is

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,840
piling on of these charges so charges

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,759
for instance in the assange tradition

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,319
could be up to 175 years in prison

191
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
it's a contentious and controversial law

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
and this extends across both ends of the

193
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
political spectrum so it's not just

194
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,319
folks on the left or

195
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,919
liberals who are

196
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,000
opposed to the act there's actually been

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
increasing bipartisan opposition to the

198
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
law

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
numerous constitutional lawyers and law

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
professors find it

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
constitutionally problematic confusingly

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
verbose

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
the former dean of columbia law

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
wrote a seminal

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
law review article in the 70s saying

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
that public speech in this country since

207
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,199
world war ii has been rife with

208
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,479
criminality

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
and one of the most interesting

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
developments actually is that just a

211
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
year ago a consortium of former national

212
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
security officials including former

213
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,360
attorney general

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
attorney general eric holder jr and

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
former cia director john brennan signed

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
on to a statement saying quote the

217
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
current system for punishing leakers is

218
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
ineffective resulting in both excessive

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
punishment and under deterrence and the

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
espionage act should be amended to make

221
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
clear that the press cannot be

222
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
prosecuted for core journalistic

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
activity

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
and this is wild we're talking about the

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
former cia director and the former

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
attorney general under obama making

227
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
these statements so there really has

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
been an increasing movement

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
which uh william will talk more about in

230
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
just a bit to try to to try to amend

231
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,960
this law

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,799
under the obama administration there is

233
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
an uptick in prosecutions of journalists

234
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
sources

235
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,640
under obama there are more media sources

236
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
than all presidents combined

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,000
that were charged include including

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
chelsea manning edward snowden thomas

239
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
drake stephen kim and jeffrey sterling

240
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
journalists were increasingly implicated

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
under the obama administration including

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
surveillance of associated press phone

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
records the naming of john james rosen

244
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
of fox news as a criminal co-conspirator

245
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
in court documents

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
and we saw this escalate under the trump

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
administration unfortunately so there

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
are numerous aggressive prosecutions of

249
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,279
several alleged intercept sources

250
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,920
actually so there's daniel hale reality

251
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
winner terry albury

252
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
also a full-scale attack on journalism

253
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
so just in the last year or two we've

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
seen numerous stories of subpoenas of

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,839
journalists that occurred in secret

256
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
under the trump doj

257
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
increasingly implicating the journalists

258
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
relationship with media sources under

259
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
aiding and abetting and conspiracy

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
theories

261
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
and of course under the trump

262
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
administration we saw the unprecedented

263
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
charging of julian assange

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,959
where he faces 175 years

265
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
in prison if extradited to the united

266
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
states and one of the key issues in that

267
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
case is the fact that this is not a

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,160
prosecution of an alleged government

269
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
source this is a prosecution of somebody

270
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
who's outside the u.s government in fact

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
not even a u.s citizen and what

272
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
constitutional scholars are warning is

273
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,560
that this completely eviscerates

274
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
national security journalism because it

275
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
opens the door there's no possible legal

276
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,079
distinction between opening up that door

277
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
to non-us citizens and non-government

278
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
employees that doesn't impact any

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
potential nationals

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,959
not just journalists any potential

281
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
national security journalists but also

282
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
members of the public and hypothetically

283
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,920
anybody in this room who is dealing with

284
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,079
issues that may

285
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,959
expose anything from criminality to

286
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,160
issues in the public interest

287
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
i'll let jessalyn talk more about the

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
key issues of the espionage act

289
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
but there are numerous issues

290
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
one thing that i might actually because

291
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
i i really want to leave a lot of time

292
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,360
for q a i'm really interested what folks

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
here have to say so i i want to wrap up

294
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
soon on kind of this overview

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
but one article that i would recommend

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,880
actually is laura poitras wrote in the

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
new york times it was almost two years

298
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,320
ago a really remarkable op-ed and it was

299
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
titled i am guilty of violating the

300
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
espionage act and she laid out the case

301
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
of how

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
her publications related to edward

303
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
snowden's disclosures

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
met all the criteria

305
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
for violating the espionage act and she

306
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,519
actually said quote

307
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
if charged and convicted i could spend

308
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
the rest of my life in prison

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,160
this is not hypothetical right now the

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
united states government is prosecuting

311
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,320
a publisher under the espionage act the

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
case could set a precedent that will put

313
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
me and countless other journalists in

314
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
danger

315
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
so in some

316
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
the act is contentious and controversial

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,959
it's never before been used to prosecute

318
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,200
a publisher for obtaining and publishing

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
secrets until now

320
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
there's no opportunity to mount an

321
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
effective legal defense which we'll hear

322
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,639
more about from jocelyn and its reach is

323
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,880
potentially limitless extending to the

324
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
new york times the washington post any

325
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
media organization

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,200
and scarily enough folks in this room so

327
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
i wish that we had better news for you

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
in terms of the state of the espionage

329
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,959
act but hopefully

330
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,560
we can hear some of the more positive

331
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,519
aspects from william and

332
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
on that no i'll pass it off to jessalyn

333
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
i know that we have her on zoom actually

334
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,639
so oh hi jocelyn so i will get off

335
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
camera here and

336
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
hand it over to you so thank you

337
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
hi uh thank you um

338
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,639
basically

339
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
you know the first american

340
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,079
whose name you might recognize who was

341
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,040
charged under the espionage act um

342
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,720
famously was daniel ellsberg who had

343
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
blown the whistle you know with the

344
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
pentagon papers

345
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,680
which ultimately ended up being credited

346
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
with helping to end

347
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
the vietnam war

348
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,160
and in the subsequent decades i mean

349
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
that was back in the 1970s and in the

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
subsequent decades

351
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
it was pretty dormant there were a

352
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
couple of cases here and there but

353
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
nothing to be alarmed about and they

354
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,079
were

355
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,200
weird

356
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,240
factual allegations um involving

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
lobbyists in one case

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,240
involving a

359
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,399
summary i mean it was just a

360
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
nothing it was nothing like what

361
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
happened under obama

362
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
and when obama came into office despite

363
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
being

364
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,360
the transparency president who pledged

365
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,760
and was elected on a platform

366
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
of protecting whistleblowers and

367
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
journalists

368
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,160
in a very alarming way he ended up

369
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,320
indicting thomas drake in 2010 his

370
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
justice apart department did

371
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,160
and tom

372
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
uh worked at the nsa

373
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,440
and

374
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
um

375
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,440
basically the crime was that he was

376
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
alleged to have provided information

377
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
to a journalist

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,959
public interest information he wasn't

379
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
accused of giving um you know providing

380
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
secrets to

381
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,920
hostile foreign nations for profit

382
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,560
or anything like that it was for giving

383
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
truthful information

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
to a journalist about something the

385
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,199
government

386
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,680
was hiding and that was at the very

387
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,040
embryonic stage of i mean he really was

388
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
as snowden said if there was no tom

389
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
drake there would have been no edward

390
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
snowden because tom drake was the first

391
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,560
one who was

392
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
seriously blowing the whistle in a very

393
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,079
loud way

394
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,360
on

395
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
domestic mass surveillance

396
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
but then soon after tom drake the year

397
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
2010 ended up becoming this bloodbath

398
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,720
because the espionage act was then used

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,279
against chelsea manning but that was in

400
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
a military setting but again this was an

401
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
army whistleblower chelsea was and then

402
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
stephen kim

403
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,880
also in 2010 and he was a state

404
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,120
department employee

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
and then jeffrey sterling of the cia

406
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,600
that was also in 2010 and he was a cia

407
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
employee and his case was purely

408
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
circumstantial he ended up being

409
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
convicted on metadata

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
alone which is a whole other category of

411
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,600
frightening in these cases and then john

412
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
kiriyaku who again was another cia uh

413
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,600
defendant in 2010. so you see this trend

414
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
of not only people in the national

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
security agencies but people who were

416
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,160
working on dark ops programs including

417
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,199
torture

418
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
secret surveillance war crimes i mean

419
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
these were the things that that were

420
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
being prosecuted disclosures to the

421
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
media that to me seem clearly in the

422
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,480
public interest

423
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,440
the problem is under the espionage act

424
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
it is a strict liability law so

425
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
that means you either made a disclosure

426
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,959
or you did not

427
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
your motive for doing so is completely

428
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,519
irrelevant

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
you can't talk about your good

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
intentions in revealing the information

431
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
until sentencing after which you have

432
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,440
already been convicted

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
and meanwhile most people end up

434
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
pleading guilty rather than going to

435
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,360
trial because the law is so

436
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
draconian

437
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
most of the proceedings occur in secrecy

438
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
there are probably almost a year's worth

439
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,399
of

440
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
secret hearings under the classified

441
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
information procedures act

442
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
i was shut out of one of those

443
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
proceedings in daniel hale's case and he

444
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
was my own client and they weren't even

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,560
talking about classified i wasn't given

446
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
a reason at all

447
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,199
that i couldn't come in it was they were

448
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
not discussing classified so i mean if

449
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,720
this is in any other context this would

450
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,199
be outrageous that a criminal defendant

451
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,400
that their intent doesn't matter um that

452
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,319
their own attorneys are getting shut out

453
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,119
of proceedings this is guantanamo

454
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,160
bay stuff this is abu ghraib stuff this

455
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
is not supposed to be the united states

456
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,839
of america

457
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
but 2010

458
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
you know started this bloodbath and i

459
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
was hoping

460
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
because we had a a pause you know

461
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
snowden occurred in 2013 but we had kind

462
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
of a pause and i thought

463
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
maybe the government had learned that

464
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
this was not a wise way to

465
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
go after what it considered

466
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,679
improper disclosures of classified

467
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,880
information

468
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
but then

469
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
trump who famously

470
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,160
hated the media and called the media an

471
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,039
enemy of the state i mean think about

472
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,039
the the kind of

473
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,840
kafka-esque gaslighting involved in that

474
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,880
statement

475
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
but trump

476
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
his um jeff sessions

477
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
early on his attorney one of the people

478
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
in his attorney general um structure

479
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,559
said dust it off said we are going to go

480
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,679
after leak cases with the vengeance and

481
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
dusted off a whole bunch of moldy oldies

482
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,760
that holder had not prosecuted so that

483
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,840
reinvigorated the case against people

484
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,440
like daniel hill that reinvigorated the

485
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
case against assange which had been

486
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
dormant same with daniel hale i mean he

487
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
was first investigated and raided back

488
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
in 2014

489
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,360
but suddenly

490
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,679
all of these cases that seemed dormant

491
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,559
were suddenly brought to life

492
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
and are

493
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,679
poised to create disastrous

494
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,039
precedent

495
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,520
in between we did get some bad president

496
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,880
with reality winner and then just really

497
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
very recently within the last week and

498
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,080
joshua schulte's case

499
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,790
daniel hale

500
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,960
[Music]

501
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
ended up

502
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
pleading guilty his crime was blowing

503
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
the whistle on the drone program and in

504
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
particular that 90

505
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
of the people that we targeted

506
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,600
had nothing to do with terrorism and

507
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,880
that most of the casualties were

508
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
not um enemy combatants or even people

509
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,200
who were

510
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
suspected of being involved but rather

511
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
innocent civilians and most of the time

512
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,799
we didn't get our target

513
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
that was only kind of

514
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,799
this is the first year after a mistaken

515
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,520
drone strike

516
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
this is the first year ever in 2021

517
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
22 where the u.s said

518
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
oops we made a mistake

519
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
that was the first time i heard us have

520
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
any admission of that but daniel is

521
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,720
currently

522
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,919
in prison

523
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,480
for one of the longer sentences

524
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,960
he's been in there for a year already

525
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
and he's still

526
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,640
it's a 45 month sentence

527
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
these sentences have been getting longer

528
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,440
reality winner was kind of the outer

529
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
edge because she had to face five years

530
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
again most of the cases before her had

531
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,880
been two and a half years to maybe three

532
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,480
years

533
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,520
of potential time and then now you look

534
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
forward and you and you see assange

535
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
facing

536
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
175 years and

537
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
assange unfortunately is also crossing

538
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
the rubicon because as kerry mentioned

539
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
i had always warned that the war on

540
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,159
whistleblowers was a backdoor war on

541
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
journalism but assange we crossed that

542
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
rubicon and we are going after a

543
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
journalist and to the extent people are

544
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
trying to argue well i don't know if

545
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,480
he's a real journalist or not

546
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
legally

547
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
that's not what's important especially

548
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
in today's digital landscape

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,039
we're media blogging journalists

550
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,120
new york times mainstream

551
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,240
hardcopy journalists digital journalists

552
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
citizen journalists this puts everyone

553
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
at risk and if you're if people are

554
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
trying to draw this artificial

555
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
distinction that julian assange is not

556
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,679
really a journalist

557
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,840
what he has charged for

558
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,200
is purely journalistic activity like

559
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
cultivating sources

560
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,280
using encryption

561
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
and and publishing classified

562
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
information this is what the new york

563
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
times the washington post the guardian

564
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
all major papers do on a regular basis

565
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
but because julian assange is

566
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,600
politically unpopular at the moment and

567
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,080
because it's very easy to character

568
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,360
caricature

569
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
a whistleblower

570
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,640
it makes him

571
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,799
low hanging fruit and he can't defend

572
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,840
himself

573
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
publicly right now because he's in

574
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,559
belmarsh and effectively cut off just

575
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
like daniel hale is in a communications

576
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
management unit which were initially

577
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
created to house terrorists

578
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,280
terrorists not whistleblowers currently

579
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,720
um i mean daniel is in prison with

580
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
you know people who tried to overthrow

581
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
this country

582
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,480
with neo-nazis and a bunch of other

583
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
people who were not trying to promote

584
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
democracy and i think that's the

585
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
the fate that assange

586
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
faces part of what has been so

587
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
disingenuous

588
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,520
is when the u.s assured everybody that

589
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,080
assange would not be placed in a super

590
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,280
max

591
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
guess what

592
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,919
they're going to place them in a

593
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,320
communications management unit like

594
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,799
daniel which is in many ways worse than

595
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
a super max because even it is super max

596
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,360
you can communicate

597
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,240
with your own attorney and friends and

598
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
family

599
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
in the communications management unit

600
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
they manage your communications by not

601
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,200
letting you communicate

602
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
with anyone absent serious

603
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
strictures that i don't think would pass

604
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
constitutional muster

605
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
um anyway i i feel like i'm maybe uh

606
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
exceeding my time here so i'm glad to

607
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
pass it on and ask you know answer any

608
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,400
ques further questions during the q a

609
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,039
uh hi so my name again is william

610
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
knightheisel i work with jess at the

611
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,320
whistleblower and source protection

612
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
program

613
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
and i just wanted to talk quick about

614
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,240
the espionage act reform attempts

615
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,919
we've seen get a little bit of stirring

616
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,840
in the past two years

617
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,720
so just a quick history of that

618
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,840
this kind of started during the trump

619
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
administration when as jess mentioned

620
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
the espionage act was increasingly

621
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
abused against

622
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
cases like reality winner against terry

623
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,480
albury and against daniel hale

624
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,600
who are really

625
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,279
cases of really purely conscientious

626
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
whistleblowers

627
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,440
and they're getting more and longer

628
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,520
sentences against these cases but then

629
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
it was really

630
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
with the prosecution of assange when

631
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
that indictment came out i think was

632
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,720
when really started waking people up on

633
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
the hill

634
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
to the really the wider threat that this

635
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,158
faces

636
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
so

637
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,240
we were starting to have more

638
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
discussions as these indictments were

639
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
coming out um with colleagues in the

640
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
civil liberties and press freedom space

641
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
and there was a sort of frustration

642
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,120
sometimes because

643
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
you know every time the endemic came out

644
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,360
there was this kind of feeling of

645
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
powerlessness like we should be doing

646
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,640
something

647
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
and so as we were talking about it a lot

648
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,240
of the sentiment we got was well you

649
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
know

650
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,120
the espionage act is kind of a dangerous

651
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
can of worms to open up now is not the

652
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,039
right time you know we support you but

653
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,840
now is at the right time

654
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,640
um

655
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
but my question you know that was left

656
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,600
at this and i don't think probably now

657
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,840
is the right time or soon

658
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
but the question was you know when will

659
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
be the right time how will we know when

660
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
the time is right and we'll be will we

661
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,799
be ready when that window comes will we

662
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,720
have gone run the traps and you know

663
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
gone through the legwork to get some

664
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
language figured out

665
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
and figured out the sort of the

666
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,919
landscape on the hill who our political

667
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,679
allies are who what's the coalition that

668
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
can do this

669
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,080
and so started having conversations um

670
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,279
with counterparts and organizations

671
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,279
primarily with chip gibbons at defending

672
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,120
rights and descent whose

673
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,400
drought has been a great supporter of

674
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
whistleblowers a great partner of ours

675
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,000
and

676
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,360
chip started having conversations with

677
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
some officers on the hill who

678
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,720
were very concerned after the assange

679
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,760
indictment

680
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
primarily there was kind of two separate

681
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,799
tracks

682
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,200
one was the sort of approach taken by

683
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
the

684
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
by senator wyden

685
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,480
in the senate side and rokhana on the

686
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,679
house side

687
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,559
who

688
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,919
drafted a bill that was very

689
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
comprehensive in terms of

690
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
the approach they took sort of widened

691
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
the amount of channels that

692
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
whistleblowers could go to to disclose

693
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
classical information

694
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
but they really they wanted to stay sort

695
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
of on the journalist side protecting

696
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,120
journalism

697
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
they didn't go after

698
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
the main sort of constitutional defects

699
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
of the espionage act that make it

700
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
difficult to defend yourself once you

701
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
are charged

702
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,559
and so we were talking with um at the

703
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,880
time tulsi gabbard and a few others who

704
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,240
wanted to take a more comprehensive

705
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
approach and say no we want to stop this

706
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,880
abuse

707
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
and so we drafted a bill with them that

708
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
was first introduced uh in it was the

709
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,159
fall of 2020 by tulsi gabbard

710
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
and that that bill the approach that it

711
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,720
took

712
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,760
um

713
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
you know we said look we

714
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,919
this bill is the statute is so flawed

715
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
that we'd like to just get rid of it but

716
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,279
what can we do that takes sort of the

717
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
abolitionist framework that we're you

718
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
know we're not going to we don't want to

719
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
just reform it in a way that's going to

720
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
leave it uh in place but not really

721
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,720
defang it

722
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,840
and

723
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,120
you know have the underside effect of of

724
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
ensconcing it further

725
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
so we wanted to really uh

726
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
look at okay what are the what are the

727
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
chief obstacles that people face

728
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
defending themselves

729
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
and we were able to consult with the

730
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
officers on the hill to draft

731
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,919
legislation that would do that so

732
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,120
there are basically five things that

733
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
we've done one is to require the

734
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,240
government to prove specific intent this

735
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,320
is one of the most important aspects

736
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,279
because

737
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
as just mentioned as kerry mentioned

738
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,919
currently uh you don't have to intend to

739
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,799
harm the united states or

740
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
advantage a foreign adversary if you're

741
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,640
a whistleblower you can still be charged

742
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
with this act and the only thing that

743
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,720
matters is did you transmit the

744
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,480
information or retain them properly or

745
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,559
did you not and so this would force the

746
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,760
government to prove that there was at

747
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,120
least some uh intent to commit something

748
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
closer to classic espionage

749
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,760
it would also create a public interest

750
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,120
defense

751
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
that there'd be some tests to say that

752
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,080
look

753
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,960
this information was relates to abuse of

754
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
power threat to public safety

755
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
classic reasonable concern of

756
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
whistleblowing

757
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,120
third it would require the government to

758
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
be

759
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,360
uh to prove that the information was

760
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
properly classified in the first place

761
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,240
because we've had such a big problem

762
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,679
with over-classification and things you

763
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,399
know that were more designed to cover up

764
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,679
abuses or embarrassment to the

765
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,559
government

766
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,520
than to actually protect national

767
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,918
security

768
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
fourth it would permit a defendant

769
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,520
charged under the act to testify as to

770
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
their purpose for disclosing information

771
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
because as was mentioned previously you

772
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,440
are not even allowed

773
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,360
to talk about what your motive was

774
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
in these cases

775
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,120
there are rulings pre-trial that you are

776
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
banned maybe just mentioned this i don't

777
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
remember but you are banned specifically

778
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,760
from saying even the words

779
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,159
whistleblowing or good motive or other

780
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,600
things that would potentially get in

781
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,039
front of the jury that might cause them

782
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,399
to think maybe there was some sort of

783
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,279
disco

784
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,440
excuse me exculpatory motive here

785
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,240
and

786
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
finally it would amend the

787
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,880
the covered persons part of the statute

788
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
to limit it to exclude journalists

789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
publishers and members members of the

790
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,679
public because as was mentioned before

791
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,200
technically the government still asserts

792
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
the power to charge people who merely

793
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,360
download these documents off of

794
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
wikileaks and maybe forward them to a

795
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,000
friend

796
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
you could still just as a member of the

797
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
public not having ever held a privileged

798
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,480
you know

799
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,840
a clearance or published position in the

800
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
us government could still be charged

801
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
with espionage

802
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
and so this would require the government

803
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,520
to actually only be able to bring this

804
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,120
against uh people who were actually

805
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,678
insiders

806
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,080
and so as i mentioned the um the gabbard

807
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
bill was the first

808
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,279
uh it was introduced around the same

809
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,320
time which one was actually first

810
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,520
actually was introduced around the same

811
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
time as the wide and kona built and

812
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,279
these were really the first time since

813
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,000
its passage of religion 1917 to try to

814
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
improve the bill

815
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,279
and all the previous amendments until

816
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,520
that point had only really expanded the

817
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
power

818
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,279
of the bill to prosecute

819
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,399
and so

820
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,679
we didn't get much traction in the first

821
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
round um but subsequently

822
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
representatives talib and omar have

823
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,480
taken up

824
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
this legislation

825
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,159
and most recently we got it

826
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,559
inserted as an amendment to the um well

827
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,480
they got a vote on the amendment to the

828
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
national defense

829
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
authorization amendment

830
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,720
we got killed at the rules committee but

831
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,000
um this is the first time we've seen a

832
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
lot of interest we got a lot of staffers

833
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,039
reaching out to us on the hill a lot of

834
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,559
organizations

835
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
finally you know taking interest and

836
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
wanting to do something along these

837
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,679
lines so we're starting to see a little

838
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,880
bit stirrings here we really need to

839
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
bring more interest and attention on

840
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
this

841
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
as i mentioned you know i think this is

842
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
probably something that's going to take

843
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
years if not decades to fix but we need

844
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
to start probing and seeing you know

845
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,240
where our allies work what alliances can

846
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,679
we make i think there's an older

847
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,919
generation of politicians who are still

848
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,039
in this sort of the war and terror

849
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,760
mindset who are less you know willing to

850
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,039
sort of give up

851
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,720
the powers inherent under the espionage

852
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
act but i do i'm starting to see this

853
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
younger generation of politicians come

854
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,880
in

855
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,120
um right now with the squad and

856
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,799
on the helping side some of the more

857
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,799
libertarian-minded folks are coming in

858
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,480
and are willing to take a look at this

859
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,760
so we're seeing some real opportunity

860
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,080
there and i think this is a time you

861
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,919
know when the war on terror is fading a

862
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,960
little bit

863
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,279
from and there's a sort of a new era

864
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,480
that we're in between and we're not

865
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
really sure what's going to come yet and

866
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
so i think there's a key time to sort of

867
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
start shaping this and building allies

868
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,559
so that we can make some progress on

869
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,320
this hopefully before a new cold war you

870
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,120
know sets in and really again expands

871
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,640
you know the the

872
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
state's um

873
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,519
you know like driving motive to use this

874
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
and abuse it so

875
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
yeah

876
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
so we wanted to leave plenty of time for

877
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,919
q a

878
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,840
well you can hear we want to leave

879
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,200
plenty of time for q a if folks have any

880
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,320
questions or concerns we really want to

881
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,720
make this conversation so i guess is

882
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,559
there a microphone

883
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,799
yep perfect

884
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,559
so we actually have an online question

885
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,320
uh are there proponents of this positive

886
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
reform within the three letter agencies

887
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,279
not that i'm aware of act actively but

888
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,799
as kerry mentioned um with this

889
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,720
commission recently

890
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
are you able to hear me

891
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
okay

892
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,360
um as kerry mentioned you know we've

893
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,000
seen former members come out

894
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
in support of doing something about this

895
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
and realizing that this is a real threat

896
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
to press freedom

897
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
yeah so historically there there have

898
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,279
actually been

899
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
members of three letter agencies who've

900
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
been opposed to the act was was really

901
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,399
interesting actually under reagan

902
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,559
there was the it was i believe it was

903
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
the cia's general counsel anthony lapham

904
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,679
who gave congressional testimony but

905
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,600
just ripping the act to shreds saying

906
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,720
that this is this laws is bs those

907
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
weren't his words specific but basically

908
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,799
coming up to that line

909
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,840
and also what was interesting is taking

910
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,760
the position that it was never meant to

911
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,240
publish or sorry it was never meant to

912
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
prosecute someone outside of government

913
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,240
so there actually happened folks i read

914
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
the statement from

915
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,399
former cia director john brennan so

916
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,480
we're we're i think politically at a

917
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
very interesting moment because there

918
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,720
there are many folks actually don't like

919
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
the espionage act and the confusion and

920
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,120
vagueness around the law

921
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,840
actually doesn't

922
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,200
serve hardliners that well either

923
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,039
i don't know that that creates much

924
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,200
political opening to improve the law

925
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,399
because there are definitely folks who

926
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,760
don't like the espionage act because

927
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,200
they think it should be worse

928
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,159
but i i do think absolutely there is

929
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,279
emerging consensus that it is

930
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,480
a

931
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,039
cumbersome

932
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,880
and

933
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,919
unhelpful piece of legislation and i

934
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:56,960
think that is important because it gives

935
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,720
us cover you know it's hard for these

936
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,159
members to stick their head out and

937
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,679
stick their neck out on this issue and

938
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
take a risk politically

939
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
um when they're not sure you know what

940
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
the reception will be so

941
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,440
uh hi so my question is about the

942
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
legislative uh effort

943
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,399
um you had said that you would like to

944
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,839
or there was some interest on the hill

945
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
of um

946
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
making it so that the government has to

947
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,119
prove something closer to traditional

948
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,480
espionage that you actually have

949
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
intended to harm the united states or

950
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,280
help a foreign adversary right

951
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,879
but my understanding of traditional

952
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
espionage is that

953
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,280
it is

954
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,199
the motivation is often the financial

955
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,359
the the you know if someone is leaking

956
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,800
or selling

957
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,879
advanced radar systems to a foreign

958
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,560
intelligence agency you know they're

959
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
trying to pay off their mortgage it's

960
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,599
not like they have an ideological

961
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,280
feeling that they want to hurt the

962
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,119
united states or something like that so

963
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
i i guess if you're not going to try to

964
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,079
scrap

965
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,918
the law entirely

966
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
and you know beyond just carve outs for

967
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
traditional journalists or something

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
like that

969
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,240
what exactly you know would uh you still

970
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,599
be trying to prohibit or how would you

971
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
define it so that it's not going to

972
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
capture the stuff we actually like

973
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,200
yeah so i i think the biggest issue is

974
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
just providing the space to mount an

975
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,960
actual defense because right now there

976
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,680
just simply is none and so giving the

977
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
ability for defendant for example to

978
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
testify as their purpose

979
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,800
um

980
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,160
and you know forcing the government to

981
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
actually provide proof that you know

982
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,119
because right now the standard is so

983
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,760
loose as you mentioned um

984
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
right now it's simply that you have to

985
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,079
be aware that it may be used to the

986
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,839
energy of the united states and for

987
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,359
government employees

988
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,760
that intent requirement is already

989
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,240
covered when you sign i think standard

990
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
form 312 if you're in a job with

991
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
classified information they make you

992
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,920
sign this form that says i'm aware that

993
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,079
any release of disclosures could harm

994
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,200
the national security will harm the

995
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
national security of the united states

996
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,440
and so therefore

997
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
if you've released any information no

998
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
matter what the purpose you the

999
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,079
government has already met its burden

1000
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,280
effectively under that that's the

1001
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
judicial gloss that's sort of been put

1002
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,839
on this and so if you are a

1003
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
whistleblower you effectively you have

1004
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,000
no avenue there

1005
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,839
jess if you have an ad jump in but um

1006
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,280
yes i would also

1007
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,800
i would also add that there are about a

1008
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,640
dozen other laws

1009
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,240
that exist to um to

1010
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,280
take care of and penalize unauthorized

1011
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
disclosure of classified or other

1012
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
sensitively closely compartmented

1013
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,440
closely held information

1014
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,839
and those laws are not used because the

1015
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,119
penalties

1016
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
are far less severe than the espionage

1017
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
act and so the fact that the government

1018
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,359
is deliberately choosing to use a very

1019
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,800
antiquated

1020
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
problematic

1021
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
clunky

1022
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,079
law i mean that that's a deliberate

1023
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,920
choice it is so punitive and people

1024
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,800
can't defend themselves but

1025
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,920
constitutional challenges to the

1026
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
espionage act

1027
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,400
have not been successful even though

1028
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,760
back in the day

1029
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,880
it was found to be virtually

1030
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,400
unconstitutional and that's why an

1031
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,440
intent requirement was grafted

1032
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,079
onto the espionage act to try to make it

1033
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,640
constitutional but now that intent

1034
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,040
requirement doesn't come into play until

1035
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
you're being sentenced

1036
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
so it's it's a very problematic law but

1037
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,400
i think it's also a deliberate choice

1038
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,680
that the government

1039
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,079
is choosing this law there have been

1040
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
um there have been other people in the

1041
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,040
national security establishment who have

1042
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,760
criticized it though usually it's long

1043
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
after the fact or said maybe we should

1044
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,440
take another look yeah

1045
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,000
and another thing i'll add too is that

1046
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
probably is no surprise the u.s is an

1047
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,040
outlier in how punitive it is with

1048
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
disclosures of

1049
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,079
public interest information or

1050
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,079
classified information actually going

1051
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,040
back

1052
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
to chelsea manning's court martial i

1053
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,359
believe it was in the appeal because one

1054
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,320
of the issues was the

1055
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,800
insane nature of the original sentence

1056
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
which was 35 years and this was before

1057
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,599
obama commuted her sentence

1058
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,599
and the open society foundations

1059
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,599
actually submitted a really important

1060
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,880
brief where they did a survey

1061
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,240
of

1062
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,800
of laws around the world for punishing

1063
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,920
disclosures of information the u.s was

1064
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,520
just

1065
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,839
exponents beyond other countries which

1066
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,400
punished disclosures in months maybe a

1067
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,280
few years but this this sentence of over

1068
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,000
30 years was astronomical

1069
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,599
and now we see that

1070
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
the sentences and the punishments are

1071
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,599
only increasing and of course

1072
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,839
the other thing which jessalyn touched

1073
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,720
on is that we're not just talking about

1074
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,880
the time of the sentence there's the

1075
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,960
element of the treatment

1076
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,440
during pretrial during trial

1077
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
and behind bars where really the mo is

1078
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
to nail people to a cross and send the

1079
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
message

1080
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
and that's what's really the most

1081
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,240
horrifying about it when you read the

1082
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
press releases in these cases like the

1083
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,599
press release

1084
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,160
in reality winners case when she was

1085
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
convicted and sentenced i mean there's a

1086
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
there's a amount of glee

1087
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,320
that these prosecutors have

1088
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,960
in setting examples of government

1089
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,040
employees who are simply acting in

1090
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,800
conscience and

1091
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
and exposing information that's the

1092
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,280
public's right to know so i think that's

1093
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
really one key takeaway is it's not just

1094
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
about numbers and sentences these are

1095
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,359
cases about people

1096
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,280
and

1097
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,560
their lives being effectively

1098
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,839
ruined over these

1099
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,880
cases yeah

1100
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
in that regard i would also add that i

1101
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,240
mean in chelsea manning's case there was

1102
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,079
a finding that during her confinement

1103
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,960
she was tortured

1104
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
that was an actual finding i

1105
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,040
i look at what's going on with in

1106
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
assange's case and daniel hale daniel

1107
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,319
hale was held part of the time i mean he

1108
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,640
was in solitary confinement

1109
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,800
now i think they're going to say oh we

1110
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,880
had to do that because of covid or we

1111
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,599
had to do that for whatever you know the

1112
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,359
government's always going to try to find

1113
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,520
an excuse but really

1114
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
the these are

1115
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
inhumane

1116
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,920
kinds of treatment and you know

1117
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
it's people are actually have been

1118
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,960
tortured i think assange has literally

1119
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,200
been held in conditions that are a

1120
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,560
tantamount

1121
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,839
to torture um and and that is always

1122
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,079
kind of swept under the rug or

1123
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,400
or ignored or may be factored into

1124
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,560
sentencing and they'll shave off a

1125
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,800
couple years because you were tortured

1126
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,640
or held in inhumane uh conditions that

1127
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,359
you know were cruel cruel

1128
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,839
detention and and violated all sorts of

1129
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,640
other

1130
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,119
human rights

1131
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,800
laws but

1132
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,119
yeah i see we have two more

1133
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,960
questions

1134
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,240
you actually just answered a little bit

1135
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,160
of it um but my question is um like

1136
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,680
who's the opposition to this is there

1137
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,960
another conference with three people

1138
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,720
saying the espionage act is great and we

1139
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,880
should do it i'm like you know torturing

1140
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
people secret trials these are not

1141
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,880
things that seem very american to me um

1142
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,720
and you know who are the people pushing

1143
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,079
this and are doing that you know you

1144
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,839
mentioned prosecutors you know who else

1145
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,200
are sort of you know these incredibly

1146
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,040
immoral people that are you know doing

1147
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,599
these actions

1148
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,160
well again i i

1149
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
what i've seen is is i think this again

1150
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,920
there's this older generation of

1151
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,520
politicians who's still very much in the

1152
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,839
co in the um like the cold war somewhere

1153
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,920
but on the war on terror mindset also

1154
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
and you know i think the

1155
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,839
the concept of national defense has

1156
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,760
expanded so much since this law was

1157
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
passed i mean there wasn't even a

1158
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,480
classification system

1159
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,839
when this law was passed as just as

1160
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,400
mentioned previously

1161
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,720
but the idea that you know we had this

1162
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
permanent i think when it was passed the

1163
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,520
idea was more that you know when we were

1164
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,839
at a state of war you maybe would reveal

1165
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:16,960
something that would cause us to lose a

1166
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,920
battle or to for a ship to be sunk

1167
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,839
but now there's a sort of permanent just

1168
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,000
ongoing state of just expanding

1169
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,560
securitization that any disclosure

1170
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,160
you know no matter

1171
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,520
you know if it's about something that's

1172
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
going on afghanistan halfway around the

1173
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,040
world is this you know grave threat to

1174
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,720
national security and that just wasn't

1175
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,200
there when this law was passed and so

1176
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,720
you know that that concept has just

1177
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,160
widely expanded

1178
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
and

1179
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
there is still this um we've heard from

1180
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,200
people on the hill that you know senior

1181
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
democrats even

1182
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,680
uh

1183
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,280
would be willing to

1184
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,640
respond with proposing a

1185
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,240
an actual official secrets act if we

1186
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
were to you know get this if this if our

1187
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,400
reforms ever came up more seriously

1188
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
we've heard that people would actually

1189
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,599
counter by

1190
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
proposing an actual official secrets act

1191
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,359
which the espionage act has morphed

1192
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,960
towards but the official secret act

1193
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,720
actually has prior restraint which we

1194
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
don't have yet

1195
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,440
so there is still this appetite to sort

1196
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,560
of

1197
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,800
there's just this loyalty to the

1198
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,720
defense and intelligence agencies and

1199
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
part of it is that

1200
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,000
a lot of these members their staff are

1201
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,920
they're staffed by these former

1202
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,079
employees of these three other agencies

1203
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,880
and that's where they get their

1204
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,640
expertise because they don't you know

1205
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
they don't have the funds to sort of

1206
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,000
develop their in-house expertise on

1207
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
these issues and so they'll they'll hire

1208
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,240
out you know these people for who are

1209
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,440
coming in from these thriller agencies

1210
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,640
and that's where they get their

1211
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,000
expertise and that's that's who i'm

1212
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,119
talking to when i go over the hill

1213
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,359
sometimes is you know i'll get this you

1214
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,880
know sometimes i can see the way people

1215
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
will stare at me you know when i'm

1216
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,880
proposing these changes and like okay i

1217
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,640
can tell i've got not got a fan here so

1218
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,760
on what williams said also i mean it's

1219
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,040
not just politicians it is the national

1220
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,880
security and intelligence establishment

1221
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
and it's not just one party i mean if

1222
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,119
you look at gina haspel who played such

1223
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,400
a role

1224
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,280
in in the actual torture program and in

1225
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,839
running a black site and then becomes

1226
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,200
the currency he becomes a cia director i

1227
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,079
mean it's a revolving door both parties

1228
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,800
are

1229
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,880
guilty of it and it's not just

1230
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,119
politicians you have

1231
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,359
like william said a lot of people who

1232
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,200
were entrenched

1233
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,079
on both sides of the aisle in

1234
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,520
in cow

1235
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,119
to the national security and

1236
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,280
intelligence establishment and i think

1237
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,240
obama had very much been in that camp

1238
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,319
because he had been seen as weak on

1239
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,640
national security and intel coming into

1240
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,480
office and then

1241
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,319
biden of course is very obama-esque and

1242
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,800
then trump was just

1243
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,240
he very much

1244
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,720
i mean he had his own battle with

1245
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,319
the deep state

1246
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,599
but at the same time ended up continuing

1247
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,359
these prosecutions so as much as he

1248
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
hated the deep state i'm like you're

1249
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
actually furthering the deep state's

1250
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,440
agenda by going after whistleblowers but

1251
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,760
he hated whistleblowers in the media

1252
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,480
even more than the deep state so

1253
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,319
yeah and and i would just add you know

1254
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,319
to what gary was saying you know

1255
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,800
what on the day that uh daniel hale was

1256
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,880
sentenced the justice department you

1257
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,400
know put out their press release as

1258
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,680
karen mentioned was just gleeful and

1259
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,599
the former i think was the former senior

1260
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,680
counsel for the nsa i think his name is

1261
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,880
george croner tweeted

1262
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,480
like this is awesome i'm so glad they

1263
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,079
got him but why didn't they prosecute

1264
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,760
the journalist i don't see why they

1265
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,440
didn't go get him too

1266
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
you know so they're not even trying to

1267
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,079
hide like they're just they're so

1268
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,160
empowered now by this continuing

1269
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,680
expansion they don't even you know he

1270
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,800
was clearly off message but he didn't

1271
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,359
care he's retired he's he's saying what

1272
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,880
he thinks and but this is a this is a

1273
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,800
sentiment that has just spread and been

1274
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
empowered throughout the government

1275
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,480
and the journalist in these cases i mean

1276
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,280
in in daniel's case is well known it was

1277
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
jeremy scale

1278
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,280
but again the journalists and their

1279
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,200
publications end up not being able to

1280
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,880
talk about or attend the proceedings i

1281
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,040
mean that there was no one from the

1282
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,240
intercept at daniel's sentencing

1283
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,359
and i don't know if that was just

1284
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,440
because of optics or

1285
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,920
them not caring or them knowing they had

1286
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
gotten a black eye in the case i don't

1287
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,440
know but the point is and they were like

1288
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,960
we're just as much a target of the

1289
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,040
government and i agree the government

1290
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,359
hates the intercept as much as it hates

1291
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,280
these defendants

1292
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,400
but it creates these toxic

1293
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,319
dynamics between

1294
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,160
whistleblowers and

1295
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,400
the outlets that they that they've gone

1296
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,359
to where reporters are being threatened

1297
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,440
to be dragged in and testify against

1298
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,920
sources which was certainly an issue in

1299
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,640
jeff sterling's case when jim ryzen was

1300
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,880
worried about that and in tom drake's

1301
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,520
case where siobhan gorman was worried

1302
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
about that and i think certainly some of

1303
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,240
the intercept reporters

1304
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,040
who also done reporting on these cases

1305
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,680
like matt cole um have been concerned

1306
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
about being called into these

1307
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,240
proceedings um and as much as i may

1308
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,400
differ with the way some journalists

1309
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,359
have

1310
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,240
behaved in terms of source protection i

1311
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,520
certainly

1312
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
do agree that they should not be hailed

1313
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,160
into court especially to testify against

1314
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,640
a source yeah i think we

1315
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,079
yeah i think we have time for one more

1316
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,760
question and we'll we can stick around

1317
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,520
either here in the hallway for folks

1318
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,760
that didn't have a chance to ask

1319
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,480
thanks um so i i feel like i might be

1320
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,559
asking a really obvious question but i i

1321
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,880
think the thing that's kind of um

1322
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,200
implied in all of this is that the harm

1323
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,880
done or

1324
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
i'd say the accusations that i often

1325
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,880
hear levied against something like

1326
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
chelsea manning's leaks was you know

1327
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,960
harm done to national security in the

1328
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,920
form of like actual lives lost or or or

1329
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,760
some you know some kind of destruction

1330
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,119
um

1331
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,680
is that something that that

1332
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
is is being challenged in like the

1333
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,520
proposed legislation is that something

1334
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
that has to be addressed directly like

1335
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,960
you know how much

1336
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,400
certain information

1337
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
may or may not and i mean i understand

1338
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,559
that that's very much disputed by this

1339
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,480
you know community and i i'm on board

1340
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,920
with that but is that something that has

1341
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,440
to be addressed in order to get more

1342
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,040
people on board or

1343
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,000
um

1344
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,079
you know and again sorry that's kind of

1345
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,160
an obvious question but uh

1346
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,480
i i i guess i'm interested in in

1347
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,440
figuring how to capture more support for

1348
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
um

1349
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,280
the legislative efforts that you guys

1350
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,079
are putting forward

1351
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,720
i guess we just have like about a minute

1352
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,960
to respond but i'm fine with one of you

1353
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,640
taking that

1354
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,800
yeah so i that it's it's all this is

1355
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,240
very complex and there's a lot of edge

1356
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,559
cases and so you know it's difficult to

1357
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,559
sort out but i think the approach really

1358
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,079
is that we don't want to give up is

1359
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,319
simply to provide the opportunity for a

1360
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,200
defense to claim that back to sort of

1361
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,359
take this

1362
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
defense because this this statute is

1363
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,319
such a steamroller that you know it's

1364
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,839
and that's why the government goes to it

1365
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,599
and so really to sort of just the idea

1366
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,880
is just to restore the balance we're not

1367
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,559
saying we're not we're not actually

1368
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,359
saying that you know there's no

1369
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,880
possibility of harm for these leaks

1370
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,160
we're just saying that the government

1371
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,359
should have to do a little more to

1372
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,760
actually prove their case and that the

1373
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,200
defendant should be able to testify as

1374
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,040
to their purpose and you know these

1375
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,000
basic

1376
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,240
things that you'd expect in a fair trial

1377
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
right

1378
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,760
also the damage is assessments in a

1379
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,400
number of these cases they have not been

1380
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,359
able to pinpoint any harm and in fact in

1381
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,359
a couple of the cases said

1382
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,280
we don't have any evidence of harm right

1383
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,359
now but it's going to create future

1384
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,920
harms that continue in perpetuity into

1385
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,599
forever and that was literally a

1386
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,280
government argument

1387
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,280
in two of the cases

1388
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,800
great thank you so much that's all the

1389
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,980
time that we have

1390
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:05,040
[Applause]

1391
