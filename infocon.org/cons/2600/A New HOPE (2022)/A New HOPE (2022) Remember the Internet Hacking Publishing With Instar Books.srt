00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,199
as a reminder at six o'clock we do have

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,400
our closing ceremonies we invite

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
everyone to join us there it's going to

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
be a lot of fun

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
and on to our next speaker

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
the internet remembers all yet forgets

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,399
yesterday

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
instar books wants to memorialize iconic

10
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,800
events like tumblr porn and google glass

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
how does one solicit and edit books that

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,120
try to get to the truth when sources are

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,840
ephemeral and unreliable

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
and how do you actually publish in the

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,039
modern age

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
here's a hint it's a lot easier than you

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,440
think

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,000
please welcome gene gene thornton and

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,800
miracle jones

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
hello everybody oh my god that's really

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,400
loud wow

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
amazing

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
are we hot ah incredible yeah

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,759
okay well let's jump right in because we

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
want to leave lots of time for questions

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
and to hear from you about what you

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
remember of the internet

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
but we'll start by talking a little bit

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
about publishing

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,479
does my mouse not work

31
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
okay i've hacked my mouse into working

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,840
by turning it on

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,759
okay so first back first act first let's

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
talk about how publishing works

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
so here's a common view of how

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
publishers work with writers that you

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
sort of do work

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
of a certain level of quality until like

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,119
a meter is soundly going off and then

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
one day this sort of angel descends to

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
you saying like we know that you have

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,119
written

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,880
a correct thing and we're going to

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
elevate it to the world it's like a

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
function of the quality of the writing

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
right it's going to be this sort of like

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
grandiose process you've arrived you've

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
entered the halls of this like echelon

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
of published

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
it does not work like this

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
but it does work

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,000
to explain a little bit how it works

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,959
we're going to talk a little bit about

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
the relationship between the writer on

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,000
the left and the reader on the right

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
so one day a writer gets an idea

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
the writer then decides to work on that

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
idea and encode it in the form of a book

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
taking this sort of harrowing experience

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
and turning it into an object that other

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
people can

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
look at relate to and appreciate

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
the reader then encounters the book in

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
this case the writer is just sort of

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
handing it to them in the form of this

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
bound manuscript right

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
they uh do this process of decoding the

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
book and having their own personal

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
experience with it

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
here late at night and then they are

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
changed by the encounter

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
um sort of propagating this dreadful

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
vision upon the world

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
here's a picture of the complete circuit

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
of writer and reader here

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
and publishing can intervene at this

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,519
point most effectively

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,400
so

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
what exactly do publishers do in order

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
to intervene how exactly can publishers

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
help

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,319
we believe there are five jobs that

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,200
publishers can do

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
one of them is production which is the

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
work of taking the raw idea and turning

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
it into something that resembles a book

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,120
is appreciated as a book is like

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
something you would want to buy if you

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
were for example come to the vendor

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
table and someone is selling like

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
a sheaf of documents that are binder

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,519
clipped together or like hands you like

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
a wrinkled stained like

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
sheep documents with coffee rings on and

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
says like this is my book right

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,159
you probably have like a low likelihood

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,760
of reading that there's a certain level

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
of like not expecting that form for a

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
book to take that may make you less

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
receptive to the book may make you less

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
likely to prioritize it like a publisher

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
can do something that's going to be

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
physically um durable

104
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
perfect bound

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
it's just even the name speaks to

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
quality right something that um is

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
replicable there could be lots of copies

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
you're more likely to encounter that

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
specific book

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
things that if you're working digitally

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
interact with devices well that like a

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
book that is easy to load upon your kobo

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
or like any other device right

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,400
publishers can do these things to sort

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,599
of like

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,120
knowing the form the books are likely to

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
take and to help put your book into that

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,519
form

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
it's sort of the most obvious thing that

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
a publisher will do for you

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
another thing is to help you with the

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
editorial process

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
of taking that original idea

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
being another person in the room for the

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,639
shaping of it helping to figure out like

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
their elements of your vision that were

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,240
not so clear to me that i think that i

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
can like

129
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
um with two minds working together to

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
try to articulate a process may arrive

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
at something that's more like readily

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
appreciable by all

133
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
they could do things like fix

134
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
errors in copying like other things

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
editors do right at this level

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
yeah in addition to just killing a book

137
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,120
entirely which is something useful

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
sometimes that an editor does which

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
allows the reader or the writer to be

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
free of it and to work on something else

141
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
um you don't necessarily know

142
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
you're beset by this

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
demon that's causing you to write this

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
book and you know you need someone to

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
tell you to banish that demon sometimes

146
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
and a good editor can just you know say

147
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,039
this book doesn't work at all and move

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
on which brings us to acquisition

149
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,560
editing which is another form of

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
editorial right which is like which

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
books are published in the first place

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
right

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
like attempting to kill your book at

154
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
that stage right here we have

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
it said in drawing this i was trying to

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,039
think of like what is the one book that

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
would be like

158
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
unpleasant to pick but actually i think

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
all these books i would want to publish

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
really i think like if we're

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
anthropomorphizing books i would be

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,039
intrigued by every one of them here

163
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,639
but basically deciding like what kinds

164
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,800
of books knowing your market as a

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
publisher and what sort of readers are

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,759
likely to come to you and what sort of

167
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,320
books they are likely to enjoy

168
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
or what sort of ideas or maybe would be

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,840
good to see in the world like what sort

170
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
of little devil's tower

171
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,199
sculptures do you want to see people

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
start to make

173
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,319
um

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,039
other jobs marketing

175
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
this is where we we see this person

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
squinting at books while somebody else

177
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,319
is handing an envelope of cash to a

178
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,759
bookseller

179
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
this is about making sure that books are

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
places people are likely to encounter

181
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,440
them such as a bookstore such as a

182
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
library such as other like

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
we know this one

184
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
sub distributor joe biel who works with

185
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
microcosm books who does like strange

186
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,360
sales to like rock selling boutiques

187
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
like incense stores and things like that

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
and has like an exact curation of books

189
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,160
that are likely to be found in those

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
places by people who go there

191
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
so basically putting books in the path

192
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,000
of readers who are likely to enjoy them

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
and working to maintain the

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,880
relationships with those like channels

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
of distribution

196
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
as distinct from publicity oh no how do

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,720
i no stop stop

198
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
technology is another thing that we we

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
can't do one second

200
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
let's see if we can get this back on

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
track

202
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,479
yeah publicity

203
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,240
um this is where we're sort of making

204
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
people aware that the book exists in the

205
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
first place um again making it likely

206
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,759
that you know that you should even go to

207
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
the store to seek it as sort of the

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
complementary option of marketing maybe

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
um a lot of people think those are the

210
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
same thing but they are in fact

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
different they are different as anybody

212
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
who works in publicity or marketing will

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
tell you at great length

214
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
it's true

215
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,800
and here are operations which is making

216
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,039
sure that the organism of publishing can

217
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,720
continue to sustain itself and continue

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
to provide the preceding services

219
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
publishing is these five jobs someone if

220
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
you have a publishing company someone

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
has to do each of these five things

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,960
it is nothing else

223
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
basically there's and i think this is

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
important to stress because i think this

225
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
is something you learn when you work in

226
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,879
publishing

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,319
but it's not something that's apparent

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
to you prior to working in publishing

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
there's this idea that like publishers

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
are measures of quality

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
that publishers are people who confer

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
something upon you other than these five

233
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
jobs

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
other than like that relationship where

235
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
your publisher is essentially a reader

236
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
who is in a position to do these five

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
jobs it's not like somebody was like

238
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,639
knows more about writing than you

239
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,520
somebody who like knows more about like

240
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
like classical culture who will like

241
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
elevate you to a place that you yourself

242
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
cannot do right if you can do all of

243
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
these five jobs you are essentially

244
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
doing the same work as publishing right

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
they're gradually of course like

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
qualifications on that like social

247
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,919
standing

248
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
means things to people in the world like

249
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
there are economies of scale that could

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
be done but basically like

251
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
a lot of the grandeur of publishing

252
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
doesn't really relate to like what that

253
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
value is being given between the writer

254
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
and reader yeah a good way to think

255
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
about it is just you know it's kind of

256
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,039
an inverse of the hollywood system even

257
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
though they're conflated because the

258
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
writers retain basically all of the

259
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,559
rights when they publish a book

260
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
and they can in that contract contract

261
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
at any time

262
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
they're choosing a publisher even though

263
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,560
it doesn't seem like that

264
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
to the outside so writers are out there

265
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,959
trying to find the right publisher for a

266
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,240
book

267
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
and you know the publisher has the right

268
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
to say no because you don't want to be

269
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
just bound to something you can't do but

270
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
really they are picking a publisher that

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
they think will be able to help their

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
book the most

273
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
yeah you're partnering with someone it's

274
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
not like you're being i think we have

275
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
this idea that like because we all

276
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
learned to write in school yeah that

277
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
like your writing is being graded by the

278
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
publisher

279
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,470
and that is not correct

280
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,839
[Music]

281
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,240
um it is a partnership

282
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
so what sort of partners would in-star

283
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
books be

284
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
yeah so let's get into so who are we um

285
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
so we've been working together for 20

286
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,560
years now

287
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
uh we got started publishing zines in

288
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
austin

289
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
at staples uh

290
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
where we met each other in college yeah

291
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,080
and copy max carlos the copy max was one

292
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
of our first um

293
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
operations in production yeah we started

294
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
publishing a scene called your cryogenic

295
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,839
tomorrow which was just short stories

296
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,560
that we uh we hired we hired like coffee

297
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
shops around town to carry our little

298
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
like

299
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
uh carts that we made out of uh

300
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
junkyard parts and then these would be

301
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,480
our distro units that we would keep the

302
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
zine in and then we had little funnels

303
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
in the back of them where people could

304
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
put money if they wanted to and then we

305
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,160
would collect the uh

306
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,480
the coins as they rained down they were

307
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
often stolen that's fine i remember one

308
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
time we had a little skeleton called

309
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
little nell that had like the coin was

310
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,680
like hidden behind little know and

311
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,279
somebody took little nell out and took

312
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,120
the like two dollar bills that were back

313
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,079
there

314
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
and like uh my my dear business partner

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
miracle jones like wrote a letter that

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
started to the thief

317
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,920
if you choose to burglarize this

318
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
distribution again unit again please

319
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,440

321
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
um

322
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
so you can see we have a lot of

323
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,839
expertise in publishing right and

324
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
we have both worked for um different

325
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,079
public like small presses that we sort

326
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,240
of graduated from zines to working with

327
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
like

328
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
um i worked with a place called seven

329
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
stories press for a number of years and

330
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
yeah and then i worked for ore books um

331
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,760
we which were they're both kind of

332
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,000
complementary uh presses in new york

333
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
because their partners used to be or the

334
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
people that run them used to be partners

335
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
and then they broke up on this falling

336
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
out that's legendary in the small

337
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,680
publishing world but we both worked at

338
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
both places and that's kind of what we

339
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
learned what publishing was all about

340
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
and what are various roles and what we

341
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
were good at at these places what would

342
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,880
you say as a metaphor for like who are

343
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
books and seven stories press hard to

344
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,600
one another i was thinking there's like

345
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
a lex luthor and superman vibe there's

346
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
like

347
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
they're both like

348
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
yeah they're both like luther that's

349
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,880
true

350
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,959
sorry many publishers but they both

351
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,720
published great things that we enjoyed

352
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,079
working on um and kind of an epic act of

353
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,200
uh

354
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
you know

355
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
our employee theft

356
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,560
we uh we learned how to publish from

357
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
them and then started our own company

358
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
together about six years ago seven years

359
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
eight years ago eight years ago 2014

360
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
um

361
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,800
yeah

362
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
and i guess we should talk what is

363
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,519
happening why does this keep happening

364
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
teasers sorry

365
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,399
i don't think we'll be showing up on the

366
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
screen okay if um so we have our sort of

367
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
no overhead model of publishing that

368
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
evolved from this which originally was

369
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
um

370
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
part of oh our books took care of some

371
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
of these things for us and then we

372
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
gradually sort of like learning to walk

373
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
took on more and more of these jobs

374
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
ourselves here's our mix of how we

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,560
answer those five jobs

376
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
no don't go ahead okay so

377
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,880
editorial we both have distinct ideas

378
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
about books but a very well-defined

379
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
publishing program

380
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
if we find a book that fits in with that

381
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,519
program in a way that's like pretty

382
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,040
codified as you'll see on the next slide

383
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
right and that both of us agree is good

384
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,720
like our

385
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
ideas of what is good or distinct enough

386
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
that if we agree on something yeah it is

387
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,959
likely good it is likely like others

388
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
will like it too right

389
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
um production we work entirely in-house

390
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
this is where previous experience comes

391
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,639
into play like in the course of doing

392
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
this we had to learn to make ebooks we

393
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
had to learn to make physical books

394
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
design files

395
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,360
um how to work with printers how to set

396
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
up cover files and all of the like font

397
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
management and all these different

398
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
skills that actually saves us an absurd

399
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
amount of money and makes our practices

400
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
possible at all

401
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,720
um just because we don't have to go to

402
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,079
vendors for the things the publishers

403
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
tend to go to vendors for

404
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
and that actually are not that much mark

405
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
if you know how to do them right which

406
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,760
leaves us basically the main thing we

407
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
spend money on is like very good covers

408
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,079
which a lot of people just can't afford

409
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,519
because you need to like

410
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
design the book rather than design the

411
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,279
exterior yeah if you're gonna spend any

412
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
money on anything in the book publishing

413
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,519
process it should be on a good cover and

414
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
i think people do the opposite usually

415
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
they're like we'll spend everything and

416
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
then they have a terrible cover but

417
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
that's the only thing that matters

418
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
really that's all you're doing at the

419
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
end of the day

420
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
we are told not to judge a book by its

421
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,959
cover because we all do

422
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
okay marketing we sell primarily direct

423
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
which is also important because it gives

424
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
us an income stream to finance all of

425
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
these this is actually something that

426
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
most publishers do not do

427
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
is do not sell ebooks directly which is

428
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
a deep mistake if you are planning to

429
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
start your own publishing operation you

430
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
need to keep distribution of your ebooks

431
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,040
because that is free money for you

432
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,120
whenever anybody buys a book which is

433
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
what like every month we pay our hosts

434
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,000
not our hosting services but our um

435
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
what do you call like big commerce an

436
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,760
e-commerce platform or e-commerce or

437
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
e-commerce services

438
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,880
um

439
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
through i think exclusively through that

440
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,160
right and then like sort of printing

441
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
books and distributing them is something

442
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
that's much easier we also do work with

443
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,440
a distributor to get books into stores

444
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
and try to build relationships with

445
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
those stores over time that is actually

446
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,680
something we didn't do at first and

447
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
ended up becoming very vital

448
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
um because it's just

449
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
people are not necessarily willing to

450
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
give you the right to publish their book

451
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
if you can't guarantee them it will at

452
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
least be in some bookstores

453
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,519
publishers we've worked with in the path

454
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
don't do this and it's actually very bad

455
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
when you've published a book and you

456
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
can't buy it anywhere it makes you crazy

457
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,800
you shouldn't do that

458
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,160
um business

459
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
this is the most sinister bullet point

460
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,680
in this presentation which is that we

461
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
pay ourselves for the above jobs

462
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
primarily with equity rather than cash

463
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
is this legal under the 13th amendment

464
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
who can say

465
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
um

466
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,199
we primarily fund our projects through

467
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,880
crowdfunding rather than seeking seed

468
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
investment and again we do sell our

469
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
digital copies direct so we have like a

470
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
regular cash flow plus like a quarterly

471
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
check from the distributor

472
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
um there are probably

473
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,279
this is probably something we shouldn't

474
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,320
do

475
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
the uh equity instead of cash part we

476
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
are looking at various models around it

477
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
i think that is important to us to keep

478
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
the equity in the business

479
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
but i think there if you are planning to

480
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,560
do other

481
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,839
models like this there are certainly

482
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,040
ways that you could think of a co-op

483
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,320
model you could think of other things

484
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,519
that would like

485
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,959
perhaps dilute the publishing program

486
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,560
but allow it to be more sustainable in

487
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,079
some ways and bring more people into it

488
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,199
yeah

489
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
we should probably say that we started

490
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
with nothing we began this publishing

491
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,120
company with literally no dollars what

492
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
we made the way we made our initial

493
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,759
investment was we had our own books that

494
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
we then published and then put the money

495
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
back from into the company from that so

496
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
and we had you know um

497
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
we had uh i would say a little like more

498
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
expertise because we'd worked in

499
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
publishing than somebody else starting

500
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
out so we knew how to produce books and

501
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
we know how to make e-books so i guess

502
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,240
that's a form of investment but as far

503
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
as the money that went into it there's

504
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
there was nothing so

505
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
that was very important to us so we that

506
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,639
means that we are a profitable

507
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
publishing company which is rare yeah

508
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,920
and we do try to uh we do try to make

509
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,000
money off of every book we try to make a

510
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
plan for each book and not go all in on

511
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
something just on speculation and that

512
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
does help us pay our bills that way

513
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,440
because each book is is something that

514
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
we are we don't get mad at books when

515
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
they fail i guess we can they're all

516
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
kind of benevolent to us as opposed to

517
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
this really casino style version that

518
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
most publishing companies operate on

519
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
there's a roberto colossa quote that

520
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
like publishing is invented to keep like

521
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
great men of fortune out of casinos

522
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,759
because like

523
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,639
um okay and publicity we solve by

524
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
actually contracting because this is the

525
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
thing both of us are really bad at is

526
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
like telling anybody what we're up to is

527
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,279
just like for personal reasons isn't

528
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,480
something we can either either of us can

529
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
really do very well so i think like

530
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
we contract out to a publicist who is

531
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,240
responsible for connecting our books

532
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,959
with um newspapers magazines etc and is

533
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,000
actually the only person other than the

534
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
cover artists who really and the authors

535
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,079
also as we do we do earn our royalties

536
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,679
pretty quickly with this model

537
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,199
who makes money off of the project right

538
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
now yeah that's something else we do

539
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
different we pay very small advances

540
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,679
it's the opposite of the way publishing

541
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
works generally generally people in

542
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,600
publishing cost out how much an author

543
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
is going to make through the entire life

544
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
of the book right and then that's your

545
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
advance and that's as much as you can

546
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
ever really expect to be paid by the

547
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
publisher and they don't even really

548
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
keep good records at the end of the day

549
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
so that's it you get a giant lump sum at

550
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,200
the beginning and then the publisher

551
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
goes about trying to meet that you know

552
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
level eventually um maybe telling you

553
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,520
about it or not but we pay small

554
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,600
advances and then you know our authors

555
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
generally earn those advances back

556
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
pretty fast and then we just pay

557
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,880
royalties and that's easier and it keeps

558
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
the author interested and it's uh it's

559
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,039
more fun we're kind of it's sometimes

560
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
it's a lot of work for jean who does the

561
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
work but

562
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
i think i think she enjoys like seeing

563
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,799
that i enjoy accounting yeah

564
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,360
that's true okay so

565
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
what is that editorial program let me

566
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
quickly go back to it um any of our

567
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
books have to be one of these three

568
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
things at least which is digital

569
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
experiments

570
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
um work by trans people like trans

571
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,480
literature is something that's very

572
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
important

573
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
to me as part of the program right and

574
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
then fiction for the troubled

575
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
a book has to be at least one of these

576
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,799
three and ideally it is more than one of

577
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
these three i deal at least two

578
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
um to be a really good in-star title

579
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,520
um

580
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
as you can see our we do fantastically

581
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
well at it um

582
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
it's really funny because this check

583
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
came in while i was preparing the

584
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
presentation this is our quarterly

585
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,840
distribution check for um netting out

586
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
586 dollars right and we had like

587
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
opposite reactions to like this check

588
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
where i don't think this is a very good

589
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,919
check for a quarter of work but i'm like

590
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,280
oh boy 500 in profit just to us amazing

591
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,679
yeah it's mostly to the authors though

592
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
it's not really mostly to us

593
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
but um as you can i included the slide

594
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,080
in part because it was just funny that i

595
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
got this while i'm like feeling very

596
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
optimistic about this model it's like oh

597
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
yeah this is the reality part but also

598
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
that like if you choose to do this it is

599
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
important to remember that like although

600
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,480
we

601
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,840
have and i'm very proud to say have

602
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,280
never run in the red

603
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
like i think there's never maybe like at

604
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
the very beginning there have been a

605
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
couple of quarters where we've run in

606
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
the red like right at the start but

607
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
otherwise no

608
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
and i think that is the beauty of this

609
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
model and if you are able to spare the

610
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,640
labor

611
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
to do it which is the difficulty now

612
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
because we're not paying ourselves in

613
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
cash we have to have other jobs and that

614
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
limits the amount of actual throughput

615
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
we can do i don't want to sugarcoat that

616
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,760
as being like but it's great because

617
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,960
it's really not great i would like to be

618
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,440
doing more books than we're doing right

619
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
but um

620
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
you can make this work and have the

621
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
business be self-sustaining without

622
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
sucking money away from your life

623
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,280
is sort of the thing i want to

624
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,480
express

625
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,919
if you're seeking this that this is like

626
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,679
if you're seeking stories that are not

627
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,640
being

628
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
represented elsewhere like some of our

629
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,960
books about um the twine scene books by

630
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
trans people we're had a have a brief

631
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
period right now of being accepted by

632
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,760
major publishers but

633
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
mostly have not been have historically

634
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
come out of like very small presses

635
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
right

636
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,760
that create this ferment and they're

637
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
like fiction books that we do that just

638
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,159
like

639
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,760
people don't necessarily like

640
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
masterworks i think like i don't know

641
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
like that's a really intense and strange

642
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,039
duck that i'm very proud to publish but

643
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
it's also like

644
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,799
a complicated book to publish right

645
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,120
um everybody has their own editorial

646
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
vision about what sorts of books should

647
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,760
be in the world like what sorts of devil

648
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
tower people should make and this is

649
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,120
basically to say like you can do this

650
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
if you're willing to make the sort of

651
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,200
sacrifices of time to do it it actually

652
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
is not that hard to set it up and make

653
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,000
it work

654
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
and we're happy to take questions from

655
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
specific dreaming publishers at the end

656
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
but we would also

657
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
like to tell you about

658
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
our specific book this that we're

659
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
talking about which is a current project

660
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,039
called

661
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,280
the remember uh remember the internet

662
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
and a little bit about the history of

663
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
this

664
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,799
this is the concept

665
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,679
um

666
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
as all good concepts it is

667
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
mathematically hard to achieve

668
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,200
and uh vertiginous and exciting

669
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,440
[Music]

670
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,080
it fits the program in two ways it is

671
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
about a digital

672
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
it is uh deeply digital and focused

673
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,039
about creating a full history of spaces

674
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
um one at a time as well as our personal

675
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
relationships with these many of the

676
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,159
authors are trans right so it ends up

677
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,200
advancing the project of trans

678
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
literature in ways it is unfortunately

679
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,480
fictional

680
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
do you want to talk more about the

681
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,039
genesis of this because this was really

682
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
your idea oh well it was an idea that i

683
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
think we both wanted to do forever in

684
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
some way or another just like it kind of

685
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
fits both of our interests

686
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,480
you know deeply i think i got it i was

687
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
inspired by it by watching how you you

688
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
think about and talk about the internet

689
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
which is uh you know

690
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
as this place that you know it has a

691
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,960
real

692
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
role i'm not even sure if i like the

693
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
internet at all like i just got a phone

694
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
like two years ago so um

695
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
but uh the uh

696
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
but i love history i'm a huge history uh

697
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
fanatic i'd say um

698
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,360
but i was working for or books uh and i

699
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
i was working on this project

700
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
everybody here knows the well right or

701
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
is familiar with the the well

702
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
um this was the

703
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
whole earth electronic link it was a um

704
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
early sort of social media site it still

705
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
exists i think salon bought it but it it

706
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,480
still exists in some form or another

707
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
and so

708
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,280
kim hofstrada who runs paper magazine

709
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,720
you're used to

710
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,919
collected a bunch of

711
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
message logs from the well uh

712
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,000
surrounding the death of this guy tom

713
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,039
mandel

714
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,000
who

715
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
worked for time warner he was time

716
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,559
warner's i.t guy and uh one day in a

717
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
message board uh

718
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
looking for advice about a flu he had

719
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,679
discovered that he had cancer

720
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
um kind of in the in this message board

721
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
chat and then decided he wanted to be

722
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,480
the first person to die kind of online

723
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
he's like well i don't have much time so

724
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
i guess this is it i'm going to be i'm

725
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
going to be a

726
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
forever part of this new space was the

727
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
quote he he said about the internet and

728
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,679
just like dying online publicly so he

729
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,440
invited anybody to come in and just like

730
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
ask him what it was like to die of

731
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
cancer or die in general and he had

732
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
posted his thoughts in real time and she

733
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
collected all these and put him you know

734
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,640
and

735
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,840
then it was my job to as a editorial

736
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,120
assistant or books

737
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,880
to go through all these and get the

738
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,520
rights from everybody that had

739
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,760
responded

740
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,480
for this 20 year old you know message

741
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,360
board

742
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,320
um so i organized how best to do that

743
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
you know i was frequently told you know

744
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
to do these impossible projects which i

745
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
really enjoyed but so

746
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,440
okay um so i thought about the best way

747
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,919
to do this and you know i decided it

748
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,600
should definitely be an opt-in system

749
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
rather than an opt-out system because i

750
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
didn't want to accidentally publish

751
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
somebody everyone pick this book up and

752
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
see their you know in there from

753
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,919
you know 20 years this thing that they

754
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
wrote idly to this guy you know in a

755
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,080
moment of like very you know private um

756
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
sympathy uh but we got you know his

757
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,520
widow was involved that was the first

758
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,440
step we you know talked to reach out to

759
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
his widow and asked if she'd be okay

760
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
with this and then yeah i managed to

761
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
track everybody down slowly through

762
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
their uh their handles

763
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
uh and we got eventually reached a

764
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
critical mass we got enough people that

765
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,799
you could tell the story

766
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,919
you know even

767
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,159
with religions by leaving people out and

768
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,440
uh it was a satisfying piece of work and

769
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
i was just i was so into this and i

770
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
thought it was like such a fun project

771
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
but it was such a

772
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
you know impossible work of you know

773
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
just like how did how are we going to

774
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
tell these stories later like there's

775
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,080
people are

776
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
living on the internet like it's a real

777
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,159
place and it is

778
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,760
but we don't have the procedures in

779
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
place for real historical

780
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
you know

781
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
work to be done uh and people aren't

782
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,559
expecting

783
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,320
this to be they don't think about it

784
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,919
like a real place like it was a battle

785
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
or an event so the journalism of it the

786
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
history of it is is very hard to do

787
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,400
uh so then you know moving from this you

788
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
know i just thought about all the other

789
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
places that i'd want to memorialize or

790
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
the stories i want to tell

791
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
uh and there's just infinite there's

792
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
just an amazing amount of things out

793
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
there that have happened on the internet

794
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
that i think are worth

795
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
uh chronicling and in a way that is

796
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
personal and uh tells an interesting

797
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
story so

798
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,919
uh that was that was the birth of the

799
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
remember the internet series uh it was

800
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,559
this book and or not wanting to do this

801
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
series like well you then i'll do

802
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
it myself um

803
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,960
just the true draw of of the no overhead

804
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
publishing yeah you get to do that um

805
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
there's also a specific why does it

806
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
why does this keep moving ahead when i

807
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
don't want it to

808
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
there's also like yeah speaking to that

809
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
living in spaces like there there are

810
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
people in this room that i met on the

811
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,440
internet when i was like a teenager in

812
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,159
like game making forums and irc chats

813
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,440
that like

814
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
are not archived like are not there but

815
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,159
are like rich social spaces full of

816
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,279
people

817
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
that i remember

818
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,640
knowing like i'm writing a book right

819
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,159
now that that speaks to some of that and

820
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,000
just not having the archival material to

821
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
go back and look like

822
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
um things that i remember space could be

823
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
in another way to think of this book is

824
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
like if you were to try to do a history

825
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,760
of like neighborhoods one book at a time

826
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
right it's that level of like

827
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
we think of the internet and we think of

828
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
very small things sometimes because we

829
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,000
all experience it while sitting in front

830
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,279
of a screen that seems pretty small but

831
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,320
it's actually like this completely

832
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,679
vertiginous thing to think about all the

833
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,120
experiences you've ever had and all the

834
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
social circles that you've ever had on

835
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
the internet and actually telling the

836
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,520
story of that

837
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
it's like a walter benjamin's like

838
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,520
arcades project in some ways where it's

839
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
like famously unfinished work about 19th

840
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,320
century streets in paris the sadia

841
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
hartman book that just came out if you

842
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,520
read that where she's doing like it's

843
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
like the history of like um liminal

844
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
spaces in new york like it's like and

845
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,039
it's stuff that isn't documented

846
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,399
generally like the stories she's telling

847
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
are drawn from like inferences from

848
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,640
arrest records like occasional like

849
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
newspaper obituary columns and stuff and

850
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,440
trying to imagine what the life of that

851
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
would be

852
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
and trying to not do that but trying to

853
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,840
capture these sort of ephemeral things

854
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,760
in passing and also bring this sort of

855
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
like rigorous historical element to it

856
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
yeah yeah it's also important that it be

857
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,039
personal and uh you know i think there's

858
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,000
this

859
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,159
kind of feeling in the air that because

860
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,240
everything's being recorded and it's

861
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
being preserved by a place like the

862
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
internet archive or you know

863
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
a giant corporation that has all the

864
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
data or whatever you don't have to go in

865
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
there and do the work of trying to

866
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,360
figure out the context and living in

867
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,279
that world and you know but rebuilding

868
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
it like someone will do that way later

869
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
but that can't be done like you know in

870
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,440
order to actually tell the story

871
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,039
something you have to have kind of gone

872
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
through it and you know lived it and

873
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,559
it's it's way better to be a personal

874
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
history while we still have the time to

875
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
do it while we're you know in a period

876
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
where it's happening um so that people

877
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,520
in the future will be able to get a

878
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,279
better understanding of the actual like

879
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,600
physical feeling of you know being on

880
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
myspace or

881
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,039
the actual like reason why you would

882
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,000
have um enjoyed tumblr porn as as

883
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
distinct from other kinds of porn you

884
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
know which yeah

885
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
so

886
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
exactly like the internet archive is

887
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,679
creating like the fossil record

888
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,799
and like you could write a lot of

889
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,240
history from a fossil record but you

890
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,919
can't write like there are things that

891
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,679
no fossil record can preserve right yeah

892
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
that's the way to put it

893
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
so thinking about this in terms of our

894
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,960
just in terms of like that's why we

895
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
wanted to do it kind of spiritually

896
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
in terms of the specific like five jobs

897
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,039
thing if we can get the

898
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,440
slide back or anything

899
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
we have editorially we have this sort of

900
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
clear in addition to the reasons that we

901
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,799
would want to do this from an acquiring

902
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,840
perspective

903
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
it actually makes it pretty easy for

904
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,679
writers to do these particularly once

905
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
we've done the original things the books

906
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
tend to be very short they tend to be

907
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,559
very templated and they tend to be

908
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,720
pretty personally charged

909
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
as a rule i think it's easier than not

910
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
if when somebody starts asking you

911
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,159
questions about what a space was like

912
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,520
it's actually pretty easy to get a book

913
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,799
that's sort of two-spec out of that

914
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,080
the production is also very very

915
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,880
scalable because the books are templated

916
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
um so it's sort of we don't have to do a

917
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,399
lot of front-end design work as we have

918
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,760
to do with our other books we could just

919
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
sort of like plug these in once we get a

920
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
text

921
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
from a marketing perspective bookstores

922
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
tend to want series the books tend to

923
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,480
cross-sell one another if you buy like

924
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
volume two you'll end up perhaps buying

925
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,159
volume one and volume three

926
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
um if you want stores to order book five

927
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,600
and six if they've already ordered books

928
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,039
one two and three that's kind of a gimme

929
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,799
that they would add that on

930
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,200
and then the other way around as well

931
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
and from operations it tends to make it

932
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,039
profitable because of all the above

933
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,880
the disadvantage is publicity because

934
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
nobody necessarily wants to run reviews

935
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,640
of like volume 42 of remember the

936
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,559
internet like you won't get pressed for

937
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,000
that necessarily unless it's about

938
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,679
something that tends to be fascinating

939
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
this is kind of the business case for it

940
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,559
i think it's like

941
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,760
we have to remind ourselves for due

942
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
diligence that there is a business case

943
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
because i think we just kind of want to

944
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
do it you know

945
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,840
but it's the fact that it's not only

946
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
like a thing that should be done but

947
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,279
also something that i think is eminently

948
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,880
doable to write this kind of history

949
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399
generally like these are sort of the

950
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
ways to do it our models in doing this

951
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,799
other than the books we already

952
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,919
mentioned are

953
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
series like 33 and a third

954
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
if people are familiar with these books

955
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,120
do people know about these books like

956
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,360
show hands 33 and a third

957
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,640
yeah they're just one the person i

958
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
expected

959
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
yeah they're just they're individual

960
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,000
books about an album uh written by

961
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,360
journalists or

962
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
or writers uh fiction writers they take

963
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,039
one specific album and they write an

964
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,880
entire book about their relationship

965
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,760
with this album uh

966
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
yeah totally and then like other series

967
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
that exist like this boss fight books is

968
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
sort of the same idea with old games

969
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,799
like people's personal experiences with

970
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
things like final fantasy there's one

971
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,840
about zzt i'm an old text mode game

972
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,799
earthbound etc

973
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,480
this one from bloomsbury publishing

974
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
called every or object lessons rather i

975
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
keep thinking the title is everyday

976
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
objects and it is not it is object

977
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,279
lessons which is why the title of the

978
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
slide mismatches what's actually on it

979
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,679
but it's basically taking like fairly

980
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
narrow topics and writing these sort of

981
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,640
intense personal reflections about them

982
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,720
sort of like one thing at a time it's a

983
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
similar like virtiginously complicated

984
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,559
project to do

985
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,480
um these series are all like

986
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
you can go into almost any bookstore and

987
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
just see like a big stack of these there

988
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
are like a hundred books in each of

989
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,679
these series and we sort of use these as

990
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,039
a template

991
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,559
as you can see and thinking of how our

992
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,919
books were going to look trying to have

993
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,320
very simple designs

994
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,919
that are very repeatable but also sort

995
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,840
of surprising in terms of what we do you

996
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,600
notice also that like our template

997
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
changed as we did these because like it

998
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,679
makes me crazy that the text isn't lined

999
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,399
up but that's neither here nor there i

1000
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,240
mean you can see we've we've physically

1001
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,320
done these books they're right here um

1002
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,519
there's a fourth one as well that's

1003
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,360
forthcoming

1004
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,039
the editorial process on this i think is

1005
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,399
worth talking about um do you want to

1006
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,600
talk about working with miles at all on

1007
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,399
this

1008
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,240
yeah so miles is one of the authors that

1009
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
i worked with it or did anybody here

1010
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,120
know miles clee um

1011
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,679
he so he's editor at mel magazine

1012
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
uh which is an amazing magazine i really

1013
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
recommend checking out mel um i think

1014
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
they do really interesting work it's

1015
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
like it's like a combination of gawker

1016
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,720
and jezebel but with like but it's

1017
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,440
actually owned by a dollar shave club or

1018
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
was it was kind of their marketing

1019
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,279
apparatus but then just kind of like

1020
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,840
spiraled out into its own thing so much

1021
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,519
so that eventually dollar shave club

1022
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,919
dropped them it was like you guys are we

1023
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,559
can't in good conscience like fund this

1024
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,679
incredibly weird magazine anymore um and

1025
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,080
now they're free and on their own um to

1026
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
do whatever they want i really recommend

1027
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,039
checking them out i think you'd like

1028
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,760
what they do but um mel magazine uh

1029
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,640
you know does a lot of long narratives

1030
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
of internet history um you know

1031
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,840
uh and so working with him was easier

1032
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,440
for us to find people that were already

1033
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,960
working in this space and who may have a

1034
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
longer story they wanted to tell

1035
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
and that turned out to be totally the

1036
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
case so we got

1037
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
two authors at least from from mel

1038
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,240
and

1039
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
miles was originally kind of the editor

1040
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,640
behind the scenes of this project

1041
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
yeah and sort of miles uh miles uh

1042
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
bowed out at some point just because i

1043
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,159
think around the time the pandemic

1044
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,440
started everyone just had to sort of

1045
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
think about priorities and

1046
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,799
you know it did take us a long time to

1047
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,039
do these books we sort of lost a year in

1048
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,240
the middle of that just not being able

1049
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,679
to work on them

1050
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,760
but um basically we wanted to

1051
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,159
make sure that the book hit this balance

1052
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,840
i'm going to skip ahead a little bit no

1053
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
i'm not

1054
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,480
we wanted to make sure this book hit

1055
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
this balance between history and memory

1056
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,440
that we'll talk about a little further

1057
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,279
so we're working with people who have um

1058
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,440
strong personal writing chops and also

1059
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,000
journalistic like cred

1060
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,679
is kind of the ma the balance of what

1061
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,320
we're looking for

1062
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
so we did a kickstarter for this i

1063
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,919
wanted to include this both in part

1064
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,600
because it shows this cool graphic we

1065
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,879
did of this book including the fourth

1066
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,399
one that's still forthcoming but also to

1067
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,079
draw your attention to how

1068
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,079
this is actually not a lot of money to

1069
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,800
publish for books

1070
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
um

1071
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,960
and this is sort of why we're speaking

1072
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,719
to like the no overhead model being

1073
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,040
pretty effective

1074
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,239
like just to think that this is not

1075
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,239
something it was like we had to like

1076
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,839
draw this like massive kickstarter into

1077
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,879
all this thing it's like it's actually

1078
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,960
pretty simple to do um if you have a

1079
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,199
project like this brewing yes we had 10

1080
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,040
grand to work with at the beginning and

1081
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
we also had an audience you know that

1082
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,719
was interested in it from the outset

1083
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,719
which is useful we know how many to

1084
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,560
print etc

1085
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,399
yeah so we did um i want to include this

1086
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,239
just to show that this got some early

1087
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,239
good press like this is an article from

1088
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,320
the atlantic that i'm no longer i'm

1089
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,359
paywalled out of because i don't

1090
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,719
subscribe to the atlantic but it is

1091
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,079
pretty cool you should check it out if

1092
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,399
you would like

1093
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
this is a history and memory being sort

1094
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,280
of the themes of the book i want to make

1095
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
sure we have time for questions we do we

1096
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,680
do

1097
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
okay

1098
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,119
history is being sort of the

1099
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,280
journalistic like heart history like

1100
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
robert carros stuff that you're talking

1101
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,920
about this is from do you want to talk

1102
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,880
about google glass i guess yes so we the

1103
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
google glass book that we that just came

1104
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,880
out just came out it's not actually you

1105
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
know out yet technically but it's

1106
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,200
available for sale here

1107
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
but it's a it's a really exhaustive on

1108
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
the record account of google glass it's

1109
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
rise and fall

1110
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
the reasons for its failure its

1111
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,520
resurrection as an enterprise product

1112
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,440
and we got everybody on the record who

1113
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
was a developer at google glass and so

1114
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,839
you know when we checked all the sources

1115
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,800
it's just a work of of pure journalism

1116
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,079
and storytelling about this product uh

1117
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,800
and

1118
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,079
that's basically all there is to say i

1119
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,440
mean you know if that's something you'd

1120
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,280
like to read this is the book the

1121
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,359
definitive book about it i doubt they

1122
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,160
will do this again um they pointed you

1123
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,359
know they pointed fingers at who they

1124
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,000
thought were the villains for it failing

1125
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,760
um and they're all sort of you know uh

1126
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,720
uh

1127
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,480
thinking about the next you know a lot

1128
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
of them are no longer with google or on

1129
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,240
product projects like this anymore but

1130
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,599
they are still thinking about this was

1131
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,040
their passion you know trying to create

1132
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,320
an ar device that that uh was portable

1133
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,119
and scalable and you know theoretically

1134
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,560
affordable um

1135
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,000
but uh

1136
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
you know that was that was something

1137
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
they weren't able to achieve but i think

1138
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
every single one of them wishes they

1139
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
could do it again

1140
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,359
uh and so this is uh this is kind of the

1141
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,520
book for you know memorializing their

1142
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,680
project

1143
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,599
yeah and you can see from this uh this

1144
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,760
quote here is like just

1145
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,599
part of the reason why like getting into

1146
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,040
some of these engineers theories about

1147
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
why google glass failed like with this

1148
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,640
account of this hackathon that had no

1149
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,480
clear criteria whatsoever other than

1150
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
like use this product to make something

1151
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
spectacular and new

1152
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,680
um

1153
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
it's kind of like interesting like the

1154
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
level of like granularity into the into

1155
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
the rooms they're looking at so it's

1156
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
sort of like strong in the history side

1157
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,599
of the continuum

1158
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,040
and we have sort of this hybrid with

1159
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,599
anna's anna valance's uh tumblr porn

1160
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,920
which is a mix of like it ended up

1161
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
becoming i think this book started

1162
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
before the tumblr ban

1163
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
was even announced and it was sort of

1164
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
happening like we we had to very quickly

1165
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,119
add a last chapter to this book to

1166
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,800
account for that

1167
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,079
in my memory

1168
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
but um

1169
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,520
i know you can't read it anymore

1170
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
but the uh

1171
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
basically and i can't read it either

1172
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
thank you

1173
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
basically talking about the architecture

1174
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
of tumblr is leading to the creation of

1175
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
like intense discourse communities

1176
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
because of the way the tag system worked

1177
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,440
on the level of that as well as giving a

1178
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,599
blow-by-blow account of the porn ban

1179
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,440
coming down in the legal sides of it

1180
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,119
along with like anna's story of just

1181
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
growing up online

1182
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
um coming to

1183
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,119
like experience online porn discovering

1184
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,720
things about herself and her identity

1185
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,480
through it and then becoming like

1186
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
involved in these communities as like

1187
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
both a consumer and practitioner

1188
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,680
coupled with the history of the

1189
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
technology and the scene that it created

1190
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,359
as a function of the technology so sort

1191
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
of a combination of like history and

1192
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,560
memory yeah and then the government's

1193
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
crackdown with cestafosta legislation

1194
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
leading directly to the to the

1195
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,680
destruction of tumblr itself when they

1196
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,079
got rid of their porn yeah

1197
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,599
still sad

1198
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,680
there's no reason to use tumblr anymore

1199
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,480
okay

1200
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
a preview of things to come which is our

1201
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
fourth book myspace scene screens by

1202
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,839
neural sabai

1203
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
in this section this is moving toward

1204
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
the

1205
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,000
personal memoir personal experience of

1206
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,599
what it is like to use this technology

1207
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,400
in this passage nora's talking about

1208
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,599
beyond talking about their personal

1209
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,680
history with myspace a history of

1210
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,359
relationships a history of like being a

1211
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,040
teenager on myspace and coming to

1212
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,920
understand oneself and one's power to

1213
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,760
move through the world through that

1214
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,200
i'm talking specifically at this point

1215
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,119
about being in lebanon during the course

1216
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,520
of a bombing of a marina and just like

1217
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,119
the instincts to then take that

1218
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,560
experience of sort of horror and trauma

1219
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,240
and immediately post about it on myspace

1220
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,320
and watch the reaction coming back in in

1221
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,000
that moment of discovering that you can

1222
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
do that the loop of what it the loop

1223
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,079
between online the real world and like

1224
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,119
your sort of like inner horror world

1225
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,480
um being the sort of compelling thing to

1226
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,599
narrate

1227
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,359
um that book is coming out as soon as i

1228
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,800
finish editing it because we don't have

1229
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
a lot of labor time

1230
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,079
and a sort of hybrid of both i think is

1231
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,520
megan milks's tory amos bootleg web ring

1232
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,920
which is very much about tape trading

1233
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
scenes in the uh the toriyama bootleg

1234
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,960
tape trading scene online on usenet and

1235
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
listservs in the late 1990s

1236
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,960
and like web rings is sort of a way of

1237
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,560
connecting people to one another in this

1238
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,839
passage

1239
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,079
megan is sort of combining all at once

1240
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,839
um

1241
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,920
the exposure to toriyama's bootlegs

1242
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
realizing that there's more music than

1243
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
you can hear on the radio find in a

1244
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,160
story thing finding that the world is

1245
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,839
sort of deeper with this vast amount of

1246
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,200
information that's coming at you with

1247
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,320
the internet that people are being

1248
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
exposed to

1249
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,200
kind of for the first time around now

1250
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,480
like 1996 1997

1251
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,560
learning how to swim in that world with

1252
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
these rules for tape trading that you

1253
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,599
could do like setting up like

1254
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,000
two-in-ones blanks and postage etc and

1255
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,240
then also the drama of like what will

1256
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,880
chris think about my html tape trading

1257
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,880
website

1258
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,400
[Music]

1259
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,119
what is ahead

1260
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,440
so we have to finish season one as we've

1261
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
mentioned um kovid needing day jobs and

1262
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,680
things are set us behind our schedule

1263
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,119
but we are very very close to getting

1264
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,560
the fourth book out and the third book

1265
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,520
is sort of

1266
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,040
eminently available we are selling it

1267
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,119
today

1268
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,839
um season two is coming very quickly um

1269
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,280
we would like to scale it to six books

1270
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
we would like to do with crease tempo we

1271
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,319
do have to solve the problem of day jobs

1272
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,560
and the problem of capacity

1273
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
but i would like to expand the series

1274
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
pretty substantially we now have the

1275
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,680
season one books as references for

1276
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,200
writers which i think will make this

1277
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,480
pretty effective

1278
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,839
and then trying to identify holes in our

1279
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,520
coverage of season one

1280
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
we have this from our kickstarter

1281
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,440
backers about some this is a very very

1282
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,880
small section of a very large

1283
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,319
spreadsheet from our backers about what

1284
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,800
topics they would like to see

1285
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
in season two

1286
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
um we've looked at some of these cats

1287
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,839
cyber sex generally susan's place

1288
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,760
um racefill 2009 i did not know about

1289
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,720
until i looked at this on the

1290
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
spreadsheet and like the neopets was

1291
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,760
actually one of the most common ones so

1292
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,960
we will almost certainly do a book about

1293
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
neopets i think get ready for neopets

1294
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,839
the book i guess yeah as you can see we

1295
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,599
have our miro board where we plan these

1296
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,839
things book on neopets is prominently

1297
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,040
featured but some other things i've

1298
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,640
tried to censor this in terms of like

1299
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,000
who we're thinking of approaching for

1300
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,440
some of these things

1301
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,640
but one of the people we one of the

1302
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,880
groups we're thinking of approaching is

1303
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,319

the thing about the q a period is

1321
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,359
someone has to be brave and be the first

1322
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,440
person to ask a question

1323
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,160
who's that going to be

1324
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,880
hey um good question so yeah the three

1325
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,359
requirements but the first one said

1326
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,599
digital experiments what what does like

1327
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,430

yeah so we've done some really

1330
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,119
interesting stuff uh we published the

1331
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,599
every word twitter bot as a book

1332
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,079
um does anybody here know every word

1333
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,680
uh it was a twitter bot that just

1334
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,520
published every word in the english

1335
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,400
language that's it uh it was 2007 to

1336
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,079
2014. yeah

1337
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,280
uh

1338
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,079
it was created by allison parish uh and

1339
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
it's an amazing document because

1340
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,520
it uh it it tells you

1341
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,160
the how many likes each word got right

1342
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,640
so we published that you know each word

1343
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,520
and the amount of likes that it received

1344
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,920
in order of of and you know it's

1345
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,760
indexable both ways

1346
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,560
uh

1347
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
i believe the words that got the most

1348
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,359
likes where jet fuel does not melt still

1349
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,560
beams

1350
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,079
that's different that was

1351
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,720
the data was distorted by there was a

1352
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,079
there's a website that let you write

1353
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,720
sentences using every word by retweeting

1354
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,240
every word tweets in the order of the

1355
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,440
sentence you wanted to make and a bunch

1356
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,880
of people spammed it with jet fuel does

1357
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,800
not belt steam beams so

1358
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,160
the count is uh the interesting thing

1359
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
about the book is it is the count of

1360
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,319
favorites and retweets as of

1361
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,200
like a specific day in 2015.

1362
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
so um we haven't done a print edition of

1363
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,640
this book yet because it's it's very

1364
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,560
daunting it's about 2000 pages

1365
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,800
physically and we have been hung up on

1366
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,280
by publishers of legal textbooks and

1367
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,960
things when we we will do this book

1368
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,240
eventually but

1369
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,920
it's an increasingly strange reference

1370
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,760
work because it's like now if we publish

1371
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
it tomorrow we don't have new data it's

1372
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,000
going to be seven years old every word

1373
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,520
results like it's even before twitter

1374
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,960
switched to likes it's important that

1375
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
it's still favorites

1376
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,880
which uh

1377
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,920
yes

1378
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,760
other digital books i guess we've done

1379
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,240
or hot writing yeah

1380
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
yeah so we did a book called hot writing

1381
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,319
which is a uh it's a

1382
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,119
platform that this code poet and digital

1383
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,079
artist

1384
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,560
and uh just all-around sort of brilliant

1385
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,800
guy todd anderson did

1386
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,720
where he created the system for being

1387
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,760
able to

1388
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,599
perform

1389
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,440
writing online um in in a you know space

1390
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
like this or he had a mobile laptop like

1391
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,240
nathan fielder's got and you know

1392
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,079
he'd he'd do some

1393
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,280
you know code poetry that uh he'd write

1394
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,200
and then perform using

1395
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
uh keystrokes uh

1396
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,119
with to match up beats

1397
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
um anyway we published some of his you

1398
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,800
know most famous code poems as a book uh

1399
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,119
only a digital book and you know they're

1400
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,880
playable so you can play them on your

1401
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,280
browser as well

1402
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,280
yeah only a digital book is complicated

1403
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,839
because like we um

1404
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,160
a lot of i think the the

1405
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,839
principle behind digital experiments is

1406
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,359
sometimes books where the print book and

1407
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,880
the e-book are going to have a lot of

1408
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
variance between them and often where

1409
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,280
the e-book is more interesting than the

1410
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,200
print book by a great deal like one of

1411
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,800
the one of the books we did is that we

1412
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
we do have here is video games for

1413
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,599
humans

1414
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,359
where the e-book is

1415
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,040
the same book distributed with all these

1416
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,640
games you can go and explore but also

1417
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,000
with

1418
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,760
30 twine games which people are not

1419
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,280
familiar are

1420
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,599
html based choose your own adventure

1421
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,440
type games they can get more complicated

1422
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
than that but it's basically like a way

1423
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
to automate hyperlinking out but choose

1424
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,119
your own adventure logic

1425
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,200
that's really really accessible so a lot

1426
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,880
of the creators on this tended to be

1427
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,400
marginalized people trans people like

1428
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,319
queer people generally

1429
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,400
we got 30 people to play these games and

1430
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,319
sort of give their

1431
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,400
play through of them so it's like

1432
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,079
catching the butterfly and then pinning

1433
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,599
it in a box so that everyone can

1434
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,440
appreciate it but it's not flying

1435
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,880
anymore right in the print book and it

1436
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,560
is in the e-book and i think that's sort

1437
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,160
of like an interesting thing about like

1438
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,520
how do you solve that problem as a

1439
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,920
publisher and like how much

1440
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,680
distinction between the digital and

1441
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,200
print version can you tolerate and we

1442
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
are interested in that question is one

1443
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,680
of our primary goals

1444
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,920
distress tolerance

1445
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,599
who has more questions who wants to tell

1446
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,200
us about an internet space they love we

1447
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,598
have some time

1448
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,040
hello yeah cool so um you mentioned a

1449
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
bunch of other places that you've worked

1450
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,880
for um and some of them were labeled

1451
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,000
printers and some were labeled

1452
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,839
publishers are there like

1453
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,920
differences between these sometimes

1454
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,720
always

1455
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,240
yeah like a printers tend to be

1456
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,400
just the people who physically

1457
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
like manufacture the books like they

1458
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
tend to be fairly large factories that

1459
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,599
deal with like things like

1460
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
how do printing machines handle overruns

1461
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,880
or things like how do you solve problems

1462
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,560
of like extremely short-run printing or

1463
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,760
like things like the espresso book

1464
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,520
machine whereas publishers are really

1465
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,880
the ones who are that's like one of the

1466
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
jobs is to contract with the printers to

1467
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,480
manufacture the books

1468
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,680
but it's really about doing the thing

1469
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,800
like

1470
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
you're manufacturing the social this is

1471
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,079
a horrible way to describe this like

1472
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,440
you're manufacturing the social

1473
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,880
reception of someone's work

1474
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,079
is like the difference between printing

1475
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,440
and publishing if that answers the

1476
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,119
question

1477
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,559
cool

1478
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,800
other questions tell us about spaces you

1479
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,400
like tell us about the internet

1480
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,640
yay

1481
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,920
right let's hear it for the internet

1482
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
like do we still wanna so this is

1483
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,599
actually a question more um for people

1484
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
who may be watching live or online but

1485
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,839
in terms of internet experiences and

1486
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,119
communities you're soliciting

1487
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,280
information on what qualifies as the

1488
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,960
internet right because we've sort of had

1489
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,800
some interesting talks at the con about

1490
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
things like the demo scene with like

1491
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,160
bootleg parties um with piracy for games

1492
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,040
or like

1493
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,119
you know bbs's which

1494
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,480
if you're dialing directly into one

1495
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,240
another's machines like

1496
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
arguably are non-internet spaces and yet

1497
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
so i'm i'm interested to hear more about

1498
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,960
your criteria yeah i would define the

1499
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,559
internet as anything that isn't like a

1500
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,960
grim dive bar um

1501
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,760
which is what i prefer

1502
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,119
yeah like

1503
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,440
park is the internet these days yes uh

1504
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,599
thanks to pokemon go or whatever um but

1505
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,079
yeah

1506
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,800
yeah i think like having a really um a

1507
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,559
big tent approach to what is the

1508
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,680
internet like i think it would actually

1509
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,359
be very very interesting to do a book

1510
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,640
that tries to approach something that

1511
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,240
would be like the base case of the

1512
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,599
internet

1513
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,520
um like i saw an excellent presentation

1514
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,440
here on friday about quantum computing

1515
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,720
and talking about telenating like

1516
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,599
pdp-11s and like telnetting in

1517
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,280
to servers i think like things like what

1518
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,880
was it like in the library where you had

1519
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,720
access to a telnet terminal that's sort

1520
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,079
of very very like the internet but the

1521
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,760
social space might not be very much i

1522
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,280
think like

1523
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,559
um

1524
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,720
finding those edge cases would be

1525
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
interesting to do a book of in and of

1526
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,319
itself even if there's like

1527
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,440
even if the definition of what the

1528
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,880
internet is maybe has to stretch or

1529
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,839
expand to accommodate

1530
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,880
it an excellent question

1531
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,559
other questions yeah

1532
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,240
just to build on top of that maybe

1533
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,400
that's an idea for the book itself like

1534
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,280
just

1535
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,720
uh spaces that are

1536
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,880
isolated internet spots

1537
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,000
because uh so we have like with

1538
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,160
so we like the vs's are isolated like

1539
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,800
pirate boxes and library boxes are

1540
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,720
isolated nodes

1541
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,079
where you physically have to travel

1542
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,240
somewhere to connect to them and then on

1543
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,800
the other on the flip side of that are

1544
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,839
the overlay networks like tor and like

1545
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,440
chaos vpn and other ones where basically

1546
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,079
or actually now pbs is over telnet and

1547
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,280
ssh where they're not

1548
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,280
a network but the they're not

1549
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,000
easily accessible but they're accessible

1550
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,200
through hoops and like just it's

1551
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,559
fascinating how the topology of the

1552
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,599
internet

1553
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,079
and internet like or internet things

1554
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,800
whatever uh has expanded in like the

1555
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,079
past

1556
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,800
30 years

1557
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,359
yeah i think kind of like tide pool

1558
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,200
tidepool instances of the internet or

1559
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,960
these overlaps would actually be that

1560
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,480
reminds me of the book you did with oran

1561
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
like gay propaganda that was like

1562
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,319
physically i think

1563
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,240
smuggled into russia at a time where you

1564
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
couldn't legally distribute like gay

1565
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,480
propaganda meaning like any mention of

1566
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,440
lgbt people like you smuggled in like on

1567
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,200
a mesh router right and it's basically

1568
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,119
like you could connect at the olympics

1569
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,680
at that year the sochi olympics like

1570
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,960
you could connect to this router that

1571
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
would give you the book

1572
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,480
in ways that it's like this very very

1573
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,680
isolated note of the internet but there

1574
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,800
would actually be kind of a fascinating

1575
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,760
history of even though it's not

1576
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,640
connected to the old is that a

1577
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,319
mischaracterization of the book

1578
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,280
that's right it was actually

1579
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,440
steganography um we put it the book

1580
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,599
inside an image and then the image would

1581
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,280
automatically download onto your

1582
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,720
computer whether you wanted it or not if

1583
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,920
you connect it to this router

1584
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,319
essentially um to make everyone

1585
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,240
complicit in having gay propaganda at

1586
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,319
the sochi olympics yeah

1587
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,720
um it was a it was a picture of the

1588
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,319
sochi olympics medal i believe so they

1589
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,720
that's wonderful i didn't know that

1590
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,960
um but yeah i think like those are

1591
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,000
actually some of the most interesting

1592
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,680
histories in the same way like a history

1593
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
of like

1594
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
what is that island like my the island

1595
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,160
that was like the lost culture like the

1596
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,839
minoan culture

1597
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,880
in greece

1598
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,319
the one where we don't like it's crete

1599
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,359
maybe or like

1600
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,599
mike ania yeah who said that who's all

1601
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,040
about mike here

1602
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,200
yay okay

1603
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
basically yeah like those

1604
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,240
those histories are almost like the most

1605
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,520
interesting the ones that sort of like

1606
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,359
speciate because of physical distance i

1607
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,640
think would be really fascinating

1608
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,960
hi do you have a question

1609
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,079
do we have a mic for this question or

1610
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,400
oh we have to can we ask one more real

1611
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,640
fast

1612
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,760
thank you very much we have to we have

1613
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,280
to cut for time

1614
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,880
um i really appreciate everybody coming

1615
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,079
here uh thank you so much

1616
00:52:36,570 --> 00:53:09,760
[Music]

1617
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,839
you
