protests and satire

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
we're going to tell you four stories

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
one about the world and three more

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
about epic pranks we pulled on

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
corporations and how we did it

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
but first we want to know where we are

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
and its history

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
we're here on land that continues to be

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
inhabited and cared for by the lenape

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,239
people

61
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,840
new york city has the largest urban

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
native population in the united states

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
and we're committed to overcoming

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
indigenous erasure and exclusion in our

65
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,590
organizations and communities

66
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,800

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
serious

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,599
situation here with the climate change

72
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,720
that i forget about um so before we go

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
any further here uh i just want to get

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
um a show of hands uh who believes

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
climate change is real

76
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,319
all right put him down

77
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,159
uh who believes climate change is

78
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
dangerous

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
all right put him down and who believes

80
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
climate change is significantly more

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
dangerous than the amount of attention

82
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
it gets in the media

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,720
okay i'm just going to be honest this

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
talk is only directed at the people who

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
can answer all three questions with a

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
yes um so if that's not you it's fine

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
you can leave now just want to let you

88
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,319
know we're not going to spend any time

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
at all trying to convince you of any of

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
those three points talk might not make

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,439
sense if you don't believe those three

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,319
things

93
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,680
um and no no offense at all no no shame

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
if if if uh if you want to leave at any

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,879
time

96
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
um so if you do

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
want to stay

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,798
let's get going

99
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,798
as you all know catastrophic climate

100
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,639
change is already here

101
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,080
and it's being experienced all across

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
the united states

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
people are dying in california

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
people are dying in texas

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
and yes people are dying right here in

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
new york city

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
this photo was taken after hurricane ida

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
caused a flash flood last fall

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
people driving on the highway drowned

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
trapped inside of their own vehicles in

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
broad daylight

112
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,960
and this is all happening at 2 degrees

113
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
fahrenheit of average warming but

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
between 6 and 12 degrees of average

115
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,440
fahrenheit warming is our current

116
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
trajectory

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,479
and just to be clear the average

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
temperature

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
actual temperature increases that you

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
experience on a daily basis when you're

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,039
sweating

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,320
your face off

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
can be as much as five times or ten

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
times as big

125
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
but wait

126
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,639
aren't there more important factors

127
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,520
going on here trade-offs what about big

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
business what about our quality of life

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
do we have to wear grass shirts

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
do i have to stop taking flights or

131
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
driving to cool conferences to learn

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
about hacker tech

133
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,479
the reality is almost all of the warming

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
is not produced by individuals

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
it's been produced by large corporate

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
corporations

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
and they've done an extremely good job

138
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
of making it seem otherwise

139
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,960
they spent tons and tons of money over

140
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
the past several decades to lie about

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
the impacts of their operations on how

142
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
it's killing all of us

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
you can learn more about it in a great

144
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
book called merchants of doubt there's

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
also a documentary about it and there's

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
also been a ton of investigative work

147
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
done by inside climate news about what

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
exxon knew going back all the way to the

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
70s

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
it's very well historically documented

151
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
and actually the oil and gas industry

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
paid the exact same scientists that lied

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
about the dangers of tobacco smoke to

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
lie about the dangers of carbon dioxide

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
emissions

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
so whoa

157
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,840
all

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,560
right let's take a breath

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
might be a lot of emotion coming up when

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
we talk about the end of the world

161
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
so let's just give those feelings a

162
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
moment to sit

163
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
to accept them

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
even to welcome them

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
this is what it means to be human

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
and millions of people

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
all over the world are feeling this with

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
you right now

169
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,639
but

170
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,000
that's not what we're here to talk about

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
we're not here to talk about despair

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,880
we're here to talk about tactics

173
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
particularly technical tactics

174
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,319
so we've got all these huge corporations

175
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,720
spending their huge profits literally

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
bribing scientists and politicians we're

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
up against a hugely well-funded group of

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,919
lies

179
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
about a crisis that's literally killing

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
americans here and now today

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
including in new york city

182
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,440
what are we going to do about it

183
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,479
tell

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,360
better

185
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
stories

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,919
that's it

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
that's the only way

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
we don't need more data

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
we need better stories

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
the magic trick of a good story is it

191
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
uses specificity specific people

192
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
specific places specific relationships

193
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,840
to evoke universal human feelings

194
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
we've been designed by evolution to feel

195
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
most intensely about things that are

196
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
close to us

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
within a time and space that's

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
understandable to us

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
we're not designed to feel anything

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
about a 50-year projected average

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
increase in global temperature

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,759
and that's what we're going to tell you

203
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,000
about today

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
think about greater tomberg who's

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
mobilized thousands of school children

206
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
and millions of people around the world

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
because she knows how to tell a great

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
story and she is a great story

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,479
this always cracks me up this poor polar

210
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,280
bear

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
michelle wants this little guy to work a

212
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
little harder every year

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
this is another form of storytelling a

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,000
parody a work of satire from a group

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
called the yes men that calls attention

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
to the lies the oil and gas industry is

217
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
constantly telling us and this is

218
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
exactly the sort of action that jim and

219
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
i and a group of activists have been

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
working on for the past three years

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
this is how it works

222
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
first

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,760
you pose as an entity and you make a

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,120
statement against that entity's

225
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,559
interests

226
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
then

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,240
you pose as the entity again

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,800
and you say that the other person was

229
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
doing a hoax

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
and then

231
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
you circulate a press release to reveal

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
that the whole prank was satire

233
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,279
and for anybody who has concerns about

234
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
fake news i want to be very clear here

235
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
we don't lie we tell stories we create

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
works of fiction

237
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
and our opposition spends millions of

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
dollars outright lying to the public

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
every year

240
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
the stories we tell are intended to make

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
them look silly for being such horrible

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
dirty liars and to push back on

243
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
corporate control of our information

244
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,360
systems

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
and the main avenue for distributing our

246
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,800
stories is the press

247
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
who the action is heavily but not

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
exclusively relied upon for distributing

249
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
the message

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
social media has changed a lot of things

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
but it hasn't changed the fact that to

252
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,480
get your story in front of lots of

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
people you need a really big

254
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,959
followership

255
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,720
and the mainstream press are still some

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
of the biggest still have some of the

257
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
biggest audiences in the world

258
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
and there's a lot of social engineering

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
tactics that we're going to go over

260
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
today to help sure to help make sure

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
that you do get that press

262
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
and now i'm going to pass it off to jim

263
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,010
to talk about uh our first story

264
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,139
[Music]

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
down arrow press play okay cool

266
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
so

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,880
our first action our first stumbling

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
little steps into this crazy world we

269
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
took about we took a few years ago

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
was an action against google so google

271
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
has a very well-known motto don't be

272
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
evil it's probably a motto they wish me

273
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,279
and all of you have forgotten about at

274
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,320
this point

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,600
um they also have some very public zero

276
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
carbon commitments out there

277
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
however it was revealed in late 2019

278
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
that google is making substantial

279
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,760
contributions to organizations that work

280
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
to

281
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
deny or block action on the climate

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
emergency so

283
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
a bit of a disconnect there

284
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,959
so to pressure to google to do the right

285
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,839
thing

286
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
we decided to announce that they were

287
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
doing the right thing

288
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,479
so at www.agree

289
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
we put up a notice a blog post from

290
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
sundar pashai that said they were going

291
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
to stop funding all these right-wing

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
lobbying groups seems kind of in

293
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
character right

294
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
not so much unfortunately

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
so

296
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
this got millions of twitter impressions

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
coverage from scientific american grist

298
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880
protocol and marketwatch who even ended

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
up falling for the hoax and printing a

300
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,079
retraction

301
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,240
margo watch is a publication that churns

302
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
out a lot of stories and they probably

303
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
just didn't look all that closely

304
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
so

305
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
how did this action effectively game

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
society's information system to spread

307
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,399
the message we needed it to spread

308
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
well first off we were working under the

309
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
umbrella of the new york city chapter of

310
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,399
extinction rebellion so what we did is

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,079
we circulated this notice on april 1st

312
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
tr hijacking their april fool's prank

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,839
asking people to post on social media

314
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,240
with a graphic with canned language and

315
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
a link to the site

316
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,959
something i'd like to point out here is

317
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
that the yes men's tactics

318
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,639
fundamentally at the end of the day are

319
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
about gaming the press it's a very

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
top-down model of ins information

321
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
distribution happens to be very

322
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,079
effective

323
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,040
this model of distribution is from the

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
bottom up we used a distributed system

325
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
of users through social media it's a

326
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
risky strategy but it is one that ended

327
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
up paying off in this case

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,480
for a few reasons

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
it comes to one of our best practice

330
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,240
leverage existing networks who have

331
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
buy-in to your project this is a big

332
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,000
reason this was successful

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,079
extinction rebellion activists had

334
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
buy-in to our project not only on an

335
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
organizational level but also on an

336
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,399
ideological level

337
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,920
another reason this was successful is

338
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,360
they were primed to participate prior to

339
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
prior to participating so getting that

340
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,639
notice a week ahead of time

341
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,639
let everybody know what was coming and

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
also let people get excited about what

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
was happening too

344
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,399
and lastly

345
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,320
just like doing things in person i know

346
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
everything seems you know easier to do

347
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
just because it's online but it's not we

348
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
have limited time and capacity and

349
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
attention as people and digital things

350
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,240
are very easy to ignore but at this

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
point in the movement it was during the

352
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
first wave of the coven 19 pandemic in

353
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,560
the united states everyone was at home

354
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,279
and everyone wanted to do something so

355
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,800
lots and lots of people posted

356
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
a critical thing that allowed us to use

357
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,320
this distribution model too is we

358
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
created a non-social media presence that

359
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
we owned and operated we had our own

360
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
website that this was situated at having

361
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
the deception actively be on social

362
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
media is a great way to get it clamped

363
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,399
down on really fast

364
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,880
and not have you not have

365
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,240
not have the platform be able to

366
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
distribute your message but we created

367
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
and distributed some distributed

368
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
something pretty quickly that people

369
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
could reasonably believe and could

370
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
reasonably buy into

371
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
another reason this bottom up approach

372
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
worked is google is one of the most

373
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
recognizable and most valuable brands in

374
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
the world

375
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,199
so

376
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,279
and it was also distributed in a way a

377
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
single standalone blog post rather than

378
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
a press release that made sense that

379
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
seems like something google would do is

380
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,360
just like hey here's a message with our

381
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
ceo with a bunch of

382
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
uh with a bunch of really well done

383
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
graphics and stuff like that

384
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,399
so anything google does is news so

385
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,839
being from such a large brand this

386
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
probably greatly increased the virality

387
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,199
and reach on social media same tactic

388
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,839
against a less recognizable brand like

389
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
synovus energy for instance who everyone

390
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,839
probably just asked themselves who's

391
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,800
that

392
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
um and the target of one of our other

393
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
actions this probably would not have had

394
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
the same effect

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
so an interesting thing happened when

396
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,560
google responded to this prank

397
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
they asked our dns provider godaddy to

398
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
take down the site but something

399
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,760
interesting happened then godaddy told

400
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,399
them that this was not such a good idea

401
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
now we don't know for sure why godaddy

402
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,040
said this but it's very very likely uh

403
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
that this was because godaddy was aware

404
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
of the streisand effect whereas a

405
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
clampdown on information unintentionally

406
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,639
amplifies it

407
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,240
so this is an image of barbra

408
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
streisand's house it was going to be

409
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
included in a coastal erosion study in

410
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,680
california this image was downloaded six

411
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
times

412
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
before barbra streisand's lawyers

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
initiated a lawsuit

414
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
two of those downloads were by her

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
lawyers point of fact

416
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,480
but after the lawsuit this image was

417
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
downloaded 420 thousand times

418
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
so why does this work

419
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
first off when large actors in our

420
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
society do anything

421
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
it it's news when barbra streisand sues

422
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,079
somebody that's news when google tries

423
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
taking down a website we can turn that

424
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
into news

425
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,279
and it also illustrates just a natural

426
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,839
tendency we have as human beings like we

427
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,320
want to know something that we we're not

428
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
supposed to know if we're told not to do

429
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,920
something

430
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
we want to do that thing it's just

431
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,639
natural like well why come on why not

432
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,040
so this

433
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
and this principle very much applies to

434
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
google anything google does was news and

435
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,120
them clamping down on a bunch of

436
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
activists who just publicly de-pantsed

437
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
them would only multiply this effect and

438
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,839
create a david versus goliath narrative

439
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,759
which if you're doing things like this

440
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
and you're doing anything as an activist

441
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
this is exactly the narrative you want

442
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,759
to create

443
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,440
on the other hand google could have

444
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
chosen to do nothing and let us continue

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,600
to publicize the fact that you know

446
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
they're cheerleading organizations that

447
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,279
are funding the end of human

448
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
civilization

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
this concept

450
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,199
that google was stuck in that of giving

451
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
your target no good options where

452
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
everything they could do serves your

453
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,039
cause is called a decision dilemma if

454
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,599
you're designing these things it is your

455
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,679
job to put your target in this dilemma

456
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,199
and this doesn't just apply to online

457
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
pranks like this this is a universal

458
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
thing that is always worth thinking

459
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,359
about with direct action and social

460
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,559
advocacy

461
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
of any kind

462
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,559
critically though both the decision

463
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
dilemma and the streisand effect

464
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
always remember you need an audience for

465
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
these things to work they are pointless

466
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
in a vacuum so always always always have

467
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,039
eyes on your project in the form of

468
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
bystanders or document everything so you

469
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
can use that later so you can tell your

470
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
own story through all this

471
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,960
all right

472
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
for uh um going through our next action

473
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,799
i'm gonna pass things back to sam

474
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,520
[Applause]

475
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
thank you jim

476
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,919
um so now i'm going to tell you a story

477
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,320
about an action called big tech gloves

478
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
big oil

479
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
the origin of this action was that

480
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
all the major cloud providers aws azure

481
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
and google had all made major zero

482
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
carbon or carbon negative commitments

483
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
in you know around about 2020 but at the

484
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
same time they were still selling their

485
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
cloud services including artificial

486
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,559
intelligence

487
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
to the oil and gas industry

488
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
which as we know both caused climate

489
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
change and continues to lie about how

490
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
serious the crisis is in order to

491
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,919
prevent action on it

492
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
so workers groups at google amazon and

493
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
microsoft had all put out demands that

494
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
their companies end the lucrative cloud

495
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
computing contracts with major fossil

496
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
fuel companies

497
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
so to support the workers

498
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
we built a meme generator

499
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
that hosted weekly challenges for each

500
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
company for workers and activists to

501
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
create memes mocking the big cloud

502
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,039
providers for their ridiculous hypocrisy

503
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,559
we posted an announcement on social

504
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
media that prompted people to sign up to

505
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
participate in the challenge and then

506
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,600
emailed users weekly to remind them

507
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
the goal was to use humor as kind of a

508
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
trojan horse to create water cooler talk

509
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
of the companies

510
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,720
especially since we thought memes would

511
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
be hard to censor internally

512
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
and thus would raise awareness amongst

513
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
employees about the evil work that was

514
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
happening at their companies

515
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,799
a lot of memes got created by a lot of

516
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,559
people both inside and outside the

517
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,679
companies

518
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,360
but it was spread out over a long time

519
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
frame three weeks and it only generated

520
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
one bit of press coverage so it wasn't

521
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
our most successful action but

522
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
they're still funny

523
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,799
so here are some of my favorite memes

524
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,919
that people created during the three

525
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,480
weeks of the challenge

526
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
first is a question i think we'd all

527
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
like to ask google

528
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
why are you helping accelerate climate

529
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
destruction

530
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,360
this one is an artist rendering we might

531
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,159
say

532
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,600
of google laughing all the way to the

533
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
bank while they trick us into thinking

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
they're all about doing good

535
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
uh and this was a video uh that a very

536
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,280
talented animator created for us it

537
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,360
shows the amazon logo leaking oil all

538
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
over the environment

539
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
um and then turns their logo into an oil

540
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
advertisement the winner of the caption

541
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
contest was

542
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
proudly offering free two-day shipping

543
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,200
of climate destruction

544
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,080
it'll come up in a second

545
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
oh it's not oh there we go

546
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
one of the more absurd things amazon has

547
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
done with their climate pledge is that

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
they're going to rename a sports arena

549
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,679
in seattle

550
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,919
after their very two-phase commitment

551
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
and of course some of the profits that

552
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,440
enable this kind of green washing come

553
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
you guessed it from working with the oil

554
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,918
and gas industry

555
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,440
and finally here's another favorite of

556
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
mine uh the blue screen of climate death

557
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
uh which says your planet ran into a

558
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
problem and our business needs to

559
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,440
restart

560
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
instead we're going to

561
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
keep working with oil companies to make

562
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,200
things worse

563
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
um so what did we learn from doing this

564
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
action

565
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,679
one of the key things was that press

566
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,880
relations really need to focus on

567
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,760
something happening right now

568
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
we made the mistake of spacing out our

569
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
action over three weeks which diffused

570
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,039
the energy that got put into it in a way

571
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
that made it less effective

572
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
our story to the press focused on worker

573
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,919
agitation

574
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,280
but many workers groups didn't actually

575
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
participate we only really got support

576
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
from the folks inside google

577
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,039
and so even though we were in direct

578
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480
contact with

579
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,320
environmental workers groups at amazon

580
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
and microsoft the conversations died

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,679
after a little while we think because of

582
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,559
the length of the action

583
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
but activists using different tactics

584
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
was ultimately the angle of the one news

585
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,480
article that got written about this

586
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,880
action from inside climate news

587
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
where it was compared to a greenpeace

588
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,240
report on the left

589
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,120
which was on the same topic um and since

590
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,240
the action took place in the midst of

591
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,679
the pandemic

592
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
it was it was focused on the result of

593
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,799
our having to take our activism online

594
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,400
and thus it became more newsworthy the

595
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
way we were doing it

596
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
even though the participation was less

597
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
than we would have hoped

598
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,799
uh another key learning from this which

599
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
we took forward into the next story that

600
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
jim is going to tell

601
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
is that specificity is key

602
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,679
focus on a single target a single

603
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,320
decision maker a single action they

604
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
should take

605
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,400
we targeted three different providers of

606
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
cloud infrastructure in this action you

607
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,919
know essentially letting them all off

608
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
the hook

609
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
contrast this with a greener google

610
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,039
success where we targeted a specific

611
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,200
company policy and a specific decision

612
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
maker

613
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,480
specificity of target and your ask of

614
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
that target will always make your

615
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,159
campaign more newsworthy

616
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
and create make it more effective at

617
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
creating the change that you want to see

618
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
now i'm going to pass it back to jim to

619
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,360
walk us through our most recent action

620
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
the biggest wham-bang of them all the

621
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
grand finale

622
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
all right thanks sam

623
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
so

624
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
this story starts in 2018

625
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,120
when the local oil refinery in superior

626
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,440
wisconsin creatively titled the superior

627
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,640
refinery

628
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
uh blew up

629
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,280
and the entire city a city of 26 000

630
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,320
people

631
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,200
had to be evacuated and the entire metro

632
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
area of superior wisconsin and duluth

633
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
minnesota were put in danger due to the

634
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,919
very near release of any a very very

635
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
dangerous lethal chemical used in oil

636
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
refining called hydrogen fluoride

637
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
so you think maybe maybe the company

638
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,559
would change practices after this maybe

639
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,880
you know after you know putting hundreds

640
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,279
of thousands of people in danger they

641
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
they do something

642
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
not really um so they're rebuilding the

643
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
refinery and they're still going to

644
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,080
continue to use hydrogen fluoride

645
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
so

646
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
how did the company make everybody okay

647
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,320
with this

648
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,679
well they didn't um so we decided to do

649
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,799
it for them uh we created a fake

650
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,320
community outreach

651
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,240
by husky energy the owner of the

652
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,600
refinery

653
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
and their parent company synovus called

654
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,039
husky friends

655
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,520
where for free if you signed up you got

656
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,679
sms alerts within 15 minutes of a

657
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
hydrogen fluoride leak

658
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
uh the fine print letting you know that

659
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
uh the danger was a full release in 10

660
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
minutes

661
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
and uh we offered to mail people a

662
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
neighbor compassion kit

663
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,279
uh this features a soothing burn cream

664
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
for chemicals for a chemical that kills

665
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,440
on contact and a hydrogen fluoride gas

666
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,799
detector that plays kids nursery rhymes

667
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
and a little husky scientist coloring

668
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
book it's all about it's all about the

669
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
kids

670
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,000
and we publicize this by sending

671
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,279
postcards to superior residents all of

672
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
them using different domain names this

673
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
will be important later

674
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
and in the days following the launch we

675
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,919
sent successive waves of postcards

676
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,440
so

677
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
this along with press releases is how we

678
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
announced it

679
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,080
and this is what happened next

680
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
four years ago it was chaos in superior

681
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,159
thousands of residents were forced to

682
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
evacuate after an explosion and fires at

683
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
the husky refinery now four years later

684
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
to the day there's more confusion in the

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,640
community this time over a campaign that

686
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
synovus energy is calling a total hoax

687
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
here's a look at a postcard sent by a

688
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,120
group calling themselves husky friends

689
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
they claim cenovas hired them to carry

690
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,000
out a safety initiative part of that

691
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
phony campaign included neighbor

692
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
compassion kits made up of things like

693
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
burn cream and information about

694
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
hydrogen fluoride husky friends

695
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
announced that campaign to the media

696
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
this morning shortly after cenova's

697
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,679
energy reached out to us denying knowing

698
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
anything about the group

699
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
eventually today husky friend's

700
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,240
so-called media rep told us he's a fraud

701
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,600
and this was a satirical attempt to warn

702
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
people about what they call the dangers

703
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,640
of hydrogen fluoride it's a chemical

704
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
housed at the superior refinery that

705
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
caused controversy after the 2018

706
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,919
explosion tonight cbs 3's larissa mill

707
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,840
is hears from both sides a superior

708
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,200
woman who received one of those

709
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,600
postcards and one of the people behind

710
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,080
this campaign defending his actions

711
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
diane grimala remembers the superior

712
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
refinery explosion like it was yesterday

713
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,080
i was in ashland that day and i got all

714
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
these calls from work

715
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
saying and they're sending pictures to

716
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,279
me lucky you're not here lucky you're

717
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,919
not here and it just all went downhill

718
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
from there that day monday she received

719
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
a husky check compensation from synovus

720
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
for damages caused by the explosion but

721
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
the same day grimala also received a

722
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,080
postcard from husky friends leaving her

723
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
confused about the validity of both i

724
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,080
thought it was actually just them

725
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
sending it out with this

726
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,799
i thought that it was for

727
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,399
just like to brush it over and saying

728
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,000
everything's going to be okay while the

729
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,399
checks are legitimate the postcards are

730
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
not they were sent out by so-called

731
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
husky friends jim haugen who says he's

732
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
part of the group says while they're

733
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,720
pretending to be part of synovus the

734
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
work they're doing is perfectly ethical

735
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,080
i would say that huffy friend an

736
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,840
accurate portrayal

737
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,559
of the disregard that husky and sonos

738
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,080
have so that they see

739
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,559
the communities of superior duluth so

740
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,200
we're using sapphire to illuminate

741
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
and

742
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
an essential truth of the situation but

743
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
for gramala the deception arriving in

744
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
neighborhood mailboxes on the eve of the

745
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,039
explosion's anniversary is something she

746
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,440
can't understand i mean

747
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
why would they do it around the same

748
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
time even if it is a legit company why

749
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,480
would they even do it around this

750
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
anniversary they have to send it out at

751
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
this exact day wow

752
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
haugen wouldn't tell us today who he

753
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,840
actually works for or where he lives he

754
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,399
also refused to say how much money husky

755
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
friends has spent on this and who's

756
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
funding it all as of just a few hours

757
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
ago husky friends remained active on

758
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
social media their twitter account

759
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,120
sharing what appears to be a promotional

760
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,000
video in that video husky friends reps

761
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
appear to pitch their campaign to

762
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,640
superior mayor jim payne the city of

763
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
superior rep told us tonight they showed

764
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,559
up to payne's office yesterday without

765
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,120
warning that spokesperson says they felt

766
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
like something was wrong during most of

767
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
the conversation sonova's energy

768
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
officials were not available to comment

769
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
on camera tonight they did insist they

770
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,559
have no connection to husky friends no

771
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
word if the company based in canada

772
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,080
plans to take legal action

773
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,950
[Music]

774
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
so

775
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,360
fun post script to that story also point

776
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
of order i did tell them i was from the

777
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
twin cities that was not accurate

778
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,039
also fun post script to this story is

779
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,159
after not only did the settlement checks

780
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
from a class action lawsuit show up the

781
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
same day

782
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,120
about

783
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,399
then we sent two more rounds of

784
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
postcards and then a huge investigative

785
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,799
piece about a whole decade of safety

786
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,120
failures at the refinery came out

787
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,320
and then after that synovus circulated a

788
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
mailer to the entire city of superior

789
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,159
reassuring denouncing our hoax and

790
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,720
reassuring uh everyone that the refinery

791
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
was safe so

792
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,640
baited them into her into a response to

793
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
this whole thing which was pretty

794
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,000
exhilarating but this news story

795
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
it illustrates one of the main points

796
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,039
about doing things like this the fact is

797
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
the prank isn't the story the fact that

798
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
you're doing the prank is the story

799
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
so

800
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,919
so we got this news coverage

801
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,640
but the news coverage isn't necessarily

802
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
about our cause

803
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
it's not necessarily specifically about

804
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
hydrogen fluoride or the explosion or

805
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
the danger or anything like that it's

806
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
about this insane stunt these activists

807
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,039
did it's got like a dog walking into the

808
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,279
mayor's office and a bunch of random

809
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,240
postcards showing up but critically

810
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
the media covering this aired our

811
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
message anyway they talked about the

812
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,120
danger of hydrogen fluoride they talked

813
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
about the explosion they showed images

814
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,159
of the explosion next to like the husky

815
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,679
friends logo

816
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,640
so so even though it wasn't necessarily

817
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,120
about what our cause was about by doing

818
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
this we effectively got them to re-air

819
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
our message

820
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
by our best estimates in terms of people

821
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,159
reached it was around 750 000 to a

822
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,600
million people

823
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
which leads to our next point the more

824
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,600
you tie your action to real world events

825
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,919
the easier it is for the media to cover

826
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,480
so not only did we have a website but we

827
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,640
had we sent thousands of postcards out

828
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,000
to these people which is just kind of

829
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
crazy to begin with and then the media

830
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,159
had someone to talk to to interview who

831
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
interacted with

832
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
who interacted with an aspect of our

833
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
action in addition to that we had a

834
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,840
whole bunch of video footage of this

835
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,159
mascot walking around superior in duluth

836
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,960
that they could air as well so we got

837
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,880
the reason we got this coverage is

838
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
is we handed them what they needed to

839
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,879
cover it

840
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,880
because it's tied to real world events

841
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
this at this adds layers of credibility

842
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
to what you're doing too

843
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,200
because the proper response to these

844
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,440
things that you really want it's not

845
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
like oh look at this cute joke somebody

846
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,919
made it's also not like oh total

847
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
misinformation because then you haven't

848
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
gotten your message across

849
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,360
the correct response is somewhere in the

850
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
middle it's like wait what

851
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,120
what happened

852
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,360
no that's not true really

853
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,799
these are the kinds of questions you

854
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,039
want people to be asking because it

855
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,279
plays on this tension of what's real and

856
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,600
what's not and that really helps drive

857
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,519
newsworthiness

858
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,840
and finally just in terms of a tactical

859
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
choices

860
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,679
activists superior wisconsin has roughly

861
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,840
12 000 addresses

862
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
and our initial round of postcards got

863
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
sent to 2500 of them that's just a

864
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
fraction of one neighborhood in

865
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
manhattan but that's about one-fifth of

866
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
the addresses in the entire town of

867
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
superior so this is targeted at a much

868
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,960
much smaller media market it can be very

869
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
unpredictable to get national news media

870
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,240
to cover what you're doing but this we

871
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,840
successfully got local news coverage and

872
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,320
and targeted specifically at a real

873
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,000
world piece of fossil fuel

874
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,480
infrastructure a real financial interest

875
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,279
of this company

876
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,279
so

877
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,840
moving on to domain names

878
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,720
so your domain is probably the biggest

879
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,919
weak point that your action will have

880
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,600
what a target will do

881
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,919
is they will file a complaint against

882
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,919
your domain at your dns provider

883
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,320
alleging that you are infringing on

884
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,919
their intellectual property usually

885
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,279
their trademark

886
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,399
you are not

887
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,399
this stuff is protected political speech

888
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,640
you are engaging in a parody you are

889
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,480
using trademarks under the fair use

890
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,799
exception this is very always bring this

891
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,720
up when responding to the complaints

892
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
because not only is it true but it's

893
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,000
very credible and sounding as well

894
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,360
first though

895
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,399
do not rely on only one domain

896
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,480
to put our website up we had just as

897
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,320
backups of the regular domain we had

898
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,639
huskyfriends.comhuskyfriends.net and

899
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,199
huskyfriends.co

900
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,199
because in case they take a domain down

901
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,399
we can easily just spin up a new one on

902
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,918
top of that to make sure people can

903
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,918
always make get through to your site

904
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,879
always use a domain shortener for every

905
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,040
link to your website and press releases

906
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,839
and on social media so it's always going

907
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,639
to

908
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,599
to an active and valid domain

909
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,079
third is distribute domains among

910
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,079
different domain registrars this can

911
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,639
make your action much more resilient so

912
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,639
for each of the rounds of postcards we

913
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
not only use different domain names but

914
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,679
we use different domain registrars

915
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,679
because we assumed that as soon as the

916
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
postcards went out they would file a

917
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,119
takedown order and the website would get

918
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,879
taken down

919
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,280
so and by distributing them on them

920
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,359
excuse me by distributing them among

921
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
different domain registrars what we did

922
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,599
is we effectively insulated ourselves

923
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,680
from complaints at specific registrars

924
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
and made sure our website could stay up

925
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,800
fourth is don't use prominent domain

926
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,359
name registrars bigger names like

927
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,240
godaddy have their brand to worry about

928
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
smaller ones don't as much

929
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
then this can create a set of incentives

930
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,200
that can be not advantageous for you

931
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,880
and fifth is always respond to a

932
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,960
complaint if they've taken your website

933
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,680
down respond immediately

934
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,000
if if it's still up maybe give it an

935
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
hour and you get your you get another

936
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
another hour of your website being live

937
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
a couple uh registrars we've had good

938
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,320
luck with our internet.bs and gandhi.net

939
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,599
critically it's not that these guys

940
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,680
don't care about intellectual property

941
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,520
or complaints just in our experience

942
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,960
they're more likely to hear you out

943
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,599
so the husky friends website collected

944
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,520
users emails this was a part of the

945
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
satire

946
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,720
where people could sign up for the

947
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,480
services offered because we thought it

948
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
more strongly emulated the company and

949
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,560
just made our action better in general

950
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,280
but

951
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
what this did

952
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,079
is it made our website easier to take

953
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,359
down

954
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,320
so

955
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,359
synovus filed complaints against our

956
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,200
both our server droplet and our dns

957
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
providers alleging phishing

958
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,720
despite the fact that we were doing

959
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
nothing of the sort

960
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
um

961
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
we were collecting email addresses

962
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
legally we did not ask anyone for their

963
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
login credentials or any personally

964
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,839
personally identifying information or

965
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,680
financial information but this stuff

966
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,079
doesn't matter once collecting personal

967
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,400
eq information enters the equation

968
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
you've moved the debate into a space

969
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
that you don't want to be in husky

970
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,520
friends stayed up through a combination

971
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,560
of just preparation and luck on our part

972
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
last bit of infrastructure to go over is

973
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
uh email so we used protonmail as our

974
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,200
service provider we had no issues we

975
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,119
successfully emailed approximately 600

976
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,560
journalists with our announcement our

977
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
fake denunciation and our reveal press

978
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
release however we ran into a bit of

979
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,920
trouble after the action proton banned

980
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,599
all of our accounts and additionally

981
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,000
banned two personal accounts of mine

982
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,520
that were not connected at all with

983
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
husky friends after saying we had

984
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
engaged in unlawful and fraudulent

985
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
behavior

986
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,760
which we're currently circulating a

987
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,839
petition about because

988
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,400
that's a bunch of crap um and we we've

989
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,160
transparently told them like hey this is

990
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
political speech hey um we legally

991
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
collected the emails and we got very

992
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,160
boilerplate responses um very unfair

993
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,720
responses in my view so

994
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,599
but the key thing to take away from this

995
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,920
is that um

996
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
the key thing to take away from that i

997
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
advanced the slide a little too early

998
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,119
apologies the key thing to take away

999
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
from that is always route your emails to

1000
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,280
a backup email address this way you can

1001
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,200
always keep records of correspondence

1002
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,720
and you can always keep up

1003
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,760
correspondence with people

1004
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,599
in case that email address you know goes

1005
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,760
down and if your email addresses go down

1006
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,119
they're likely not going to come back

1007
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,800
there's just too many they just have too

1008
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
much stuff to deal with you're not going

1009
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
to get any kind of complaint process

1010
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,560
like with a dns provider or

1011
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,680
or

1012
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,240
or a server

1013
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,320
and last one of the best practices this

1014
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,880
is a more of an overall contextual thing

1015
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
but if you're going to do these things

1016
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
plug it into a movement sustained

1017
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,440
pressure campaigns actually create

1018
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,079
change and as kind of fun and cool as it

1019
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,640
is to like punk corporations like this

1020
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,599
it's it's not these actions don't create

1021
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
change movements create change

1022
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,400
so just bring things full circle to

1023
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,119
where sam started us on climate change

1024
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,760
this is an image of the earth from space

1025
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,079
and i really love this because it really

1026
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,480
puts everything we're going through as

1027
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,640
people in context

1028
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
so i

1029
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,359
i think a lot

1030
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,520
about i think a lot about the drake

1031
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,119
equation about the overwhelming

1032
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,880
probability that there is intelligent

1033
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
life out there in the universe that can

1034
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
contact us

1035
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,400
but

1036
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
but we haven't heard anything

1037
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
and it's if the odds are so overwhelming

1038
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,079
why haven't we heard anything

1039
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,800
and so it means are we the only ones

1040
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
here

1041
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,160
and does that also mean like how

1042
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,839
infinitely precious is what we

1043
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,440
have and

1044
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,680
also the question comes to mind is it

1045
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,079
our destiny to destroy ourselves it is

1046
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,240
it the destiny of humanity to destroy

1047
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
itself

1048
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,800
so how do we stop this we have to tell

1049
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,480
better stories

1050
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,320
so when i became a climate activist i

1051
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
kept asking myself over and over and

1052
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,240
over what should i do about climate

1053
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
change what is my role to play in this

1054
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,839
and the thing that i kept coming back to

1055
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,000
over and over and over was we know what

1056
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
the solutions are

1057
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,839
all that's left is political will and i

1058
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,839
said well if that's if that's what it

1059
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,200
takes then that's what i'm going to do

1060
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,599
i'm going to help create political will

1061
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,680
and to create political will

1062
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,400
we need to tell better stories because

1063
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
narrative is the bread and butter of

1064
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,800
human consciousness it's about about who

1065
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,280
we are collectively

1066
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
our governments have narratives

1067
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,119
corporations have narratives they give

1068
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,440
you and on an individual level you all

1069
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,680
have narratives that you tell yourselves

1070
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,079
this is who we are as people and if our

1071
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,760
current narratives are driving our

1072
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
civilization to ruin we need to ask

1073
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,000
ourselves what not only what stories are

1074
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,400
we creating what stories are we being

1075
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,160
fed but how can we alter them

1076
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,240
what can we do to change them

1077
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
so that's that's the fundamental

1078
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,760
question how do we how do we do this

1079
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,760
thing

1080
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
so we've gone through a lot of things on

1081
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
this presentation but i hope one of our

1082
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,920
your biggest takeaways from this and

1083
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,680
something i want to instill in to

1084
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
everyone here

1085
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,880
is that

1086
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
you can do this

1087
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
like sam and i didn't know what we were

1088
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,240
doing when we did a greener google we

1089
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,920
didn't know anything of the yes men

1090
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
playbook but we just stumbled into it

1091
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,040
and we had this thing that blew up on

1092
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
the internet and we just kind of taken

1093
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,920
it from there

1094
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,079
and we continued to do this from

1095
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,079
learning from other people and from

1096
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,599
getting help

1097
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,400
from just like talking to people

1098
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,560
and doing this kind of work it takes a

1099
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,480
lot of the skill sets that i'll bet a

1100
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,560
whole lot of the people in this room

1101
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,079
have

1102
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,920
graphic design web design web

1103
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,839
development if you have experience with

1104
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,599
email and spam filters that is

1105
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,079
incredibly useful knowledge for us too

1106
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,000
but all of these things are useful and

1107
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,760
wonderful skill sets so if you're

1108
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,599
wondering what you can do you have

1109
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,520
skills that can get plugged in

1110
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,760
and go do these things yourself ask for

1111
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
help when you need it

1112

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,720
we're here for

1118
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,839
um

1119
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,359
one last note before we close i just

1120
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,599
want to say a special thanks to a mr

1121
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,280
jeff walburn of the fixers they're an

1122
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,119
affiliates of the yes men who helped

1123
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,119
create this presentation

1124
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,120
and thank you to all of you

1125
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:33,759
[Applause]

1126
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,440
maybe a couple minutes for questions

1127
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,960
hi thanks it's a great presentation so

1128
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,400
um it struck me while you were talking

1129
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,720
about the corporate response that you

1130
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,079
may

1131
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,720
depending on the sophistication of the

1132
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,079
corporate

1133
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,359
side

1134
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,040
you may have had to have a somewhat

1135
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
thick skin

1136
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,160
depending on what they said so can you

1137
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,000
just tell us a little bit about that and

1138
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,599
your own ways of supporting each other

1139
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
i'm not sure we have

1140
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,280
and sam feel free to chime in um

1141
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
i'm not sure i've heard that much

1142
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
back from corporations that we've

1143
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,440
actually done this to

1144
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,119
they

1145
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,599
both most of them have taken a very like

1146
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,800
they don't want to

1147
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,480
they don't want to do anything that'll

1148
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,640
help animate this um animate this at all

1149
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,400
however i will say

1150
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,680
i mean there are there are criticisms

1151
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,079
that i've heard from people who don't

1152
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,480
appreciate these tactics people that you

1153
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,359
know i wish we we could have won over

1154
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,400
um

1155
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,200
that sometimes are hurtful

1156
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,240
uh you know some people

1157
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,560
some people don't appreciate being told

1158
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,720
these you know they're well-intentioned

1159
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,400
lies

1160
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,480
they're ultimately aimed at revealing

1161
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
truth they're not permanent lies but

1162
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,760
they are

1163
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
uh you know they are deceptions at the

1164
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
end of the day useful deceptions but

1165
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,760
still deceptions

1166
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,240
um yeah and i might add that the the

1167
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,400
thicker skin i think that the that you

1168
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,480
need to have is um

1169
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,680
is more patience um it is about uh you

1170
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,040
know it's fun to think of something like

1171
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,800
this it's fun when it's over during the

1172
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,599
middle um it's mostly not fun at all

1173
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,520
um so

1174
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,040
you know being willing to work through

1175
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
the doubt and not not putting too much

1176
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,880
pressure on yourself to feel like you

1177
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,319
have to know what the outcome is going

1178
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,520
to be for it to be worth it um

1179
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,280
and you know being open to the fact that

1180
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,040
you can't predict the outcome

1181
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,640
um is is uh is really key in in keeping

1182
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,040
yourself motivated and and especially as

1183
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,480
we mentioned before staying plugged into

1184
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,720
the movement um can can really restore

1185
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,400
that faith

1186
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
um

1187
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,160
got one more there i think yeah um

1188
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,640
hello uh amazing presentation great

1189
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,880
knowledge super helpful i was just

1190
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,240
curious that uh like the greener google

1191
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,599
or even the husky friends did that

1192
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
impact like maybe their share price or

1193
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
something that might you know

1194
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,119
help them make a step

1195
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,480
in the better direction or something

1196
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
say it again last lesson uh like did uh

1197
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,440
did any of these movements affect maybe

1198
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,119
even a bit on their

1199
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,920
market price the share price

1200
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,800
that that you know it may help them move

1201
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,839
towards they may consider a

1202
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,599
better approach to it like

1203
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,680
move towards a

1204
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,330
i don't think any of these

1205
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,119
[Music]

1206
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
uh i mean it's always would be very

1207
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,720
difficult to

1208
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,560
to make a statement about a clear

1209
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,040
causation and you know share price

1210
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
changes um but

1211
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,240
uh i i think the um

1212
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
the value in this sort of thing is is

1213
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,800
about is about particularly morale uh

1214
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
among the worker base and and and

1215
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,760
support amongst uh regular people for

1216
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,000
what they believe like is okay for a

1217
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,920
corporation to do in our society whether

1218
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
it's okay for them to lie to us and have

1219
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,560
a whole team of people professionally

1220
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,839
lie

1221
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,560
i would say it sort of works more in the

1222
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,040
realm of public opinion than it does

1223
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,119
in the realm of

1224
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,960
of the financial markets

1225
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,040
but but certainly you could one could

1226
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,920
try to design an action to move the

1227
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,960
market

1228
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,599
um on a company and um and actually

1229
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,839
folks have um the yes men the folks we

1230
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,000
mentioned earlier when they did they did

1231
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,880
a major action focused on um

1232
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,079
uh

1233
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,920
union carbide

1234
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,160
chemical dow chemical um which which

1235
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,240
which had a massive um you know the

1236
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,599
world's biggest chemical disaster in

1237
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,680
bhopal and they they they made a

1238
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,480
statement that they were going to

1239
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,200
compensate all the victims um on the bbc

1240
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,680
pretending to be them and and i'm pretty

1241
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,640
sure their their share price crashed um

1242
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,440
so it you definitely can

1243
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,839
can do that

1244
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,720
so quick question for you um

1245
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,480
you said that you had issues using

1246
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
protonmail

1247
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
which i found surprising but are there

1248
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,079
any alternative providers that you're

1249
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,559
able to recommend

1250
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
uh i don't know that many um

1251
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,119
they all

1252
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,680
i did a lot of digging into secure email

1253
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,520
providers out there and there are there

1254
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,200
are a decent amount but a lot of them

1255
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,920
have caveats um protonmail for one of

1256
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,040
their big selling points is their

1257
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,800
servers are in switzerland

1258
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,920
um

1259
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,359
there are ones that have very good

1260
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,040
practices but they end up being in

1261
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,960
either

1262
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,319
i might get this term wrong but like a

1263
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,800
five eyes or 14 eyes country countries

1264
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,480
that share intelligence with each other

1265
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,119
in general

1266
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,280
point of fact though even protonmail

1267
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,559
even though they're in switzerland they

1268
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,720
were made to reveal

1269
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,880
an activist's ip address in france at

1270
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,480
the same time so even that hasn't been a

1271
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,559
huge protection

1272
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,319
i will say i know a lot of activists

1273
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,200
really like riseup.net but i think you

1274
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,119
have to be invited to that guy

1275
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,240
i don't know too much about their

1276
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,160
particulars but i know a lot of them

1277
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
like rise

1278
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,720
up yo

1279
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,119
uh so this is pretty interesting to me

1280
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,119
but how do you minimize

1281
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,000
uh people's natural sort of habits of

1282
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
having incomplete information and acting

1283
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,839
on it so for example you sent those

1284
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,920
postcards out right right somebody

1285
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,839
receives that information and they now

1286
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,359
they may think oh this is in the best

1287
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,559
interest of

1288
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,400
the company or whatever it is companies

1289
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,319
are in the best interest of me it might

1290
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,760
have the opposite effect of what you

1291
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,240
intend so how do you minimize that that

1292
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,079
sort of risk right if you're gonna

1293
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,920
acting on behalf of a company

1294
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,880
yeah totally i mean i think there's um

1295
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,480
uh there's always risk involved in uh in

1296
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,920
doing an action like this is it gonna

1297
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,760
have the intended effect that we want is

1298
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,280
it actually going to turn people against

1299
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
our cause um

1300
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,720
that's that is the risk you're running

1301
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
when you do this um

1302
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,960
but at the same time uh we're really

1303
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,119
running out of time uh we only have um

1304
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,160
i think seven more earth days until

1305
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,880
we're supposed to be at like 50 of our

1306
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,119
current emissions

1307
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,200
um so we're kind of in a like throw it

1308
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,359
all at the wall phase um

1309
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,119
and see what sticks

1310
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,760
uh i i think the um you know whether

1311
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,920
whether or not people act on it and and

1312
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,599
in fact like think better of the company

1313
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,280
which i think some people in superior

1314
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,040
did they got the they got that postcard

1315
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,119
and they were like wow they they care

1316
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
about us this is great

1317
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,400
um

1318
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,720
i i don't i don't see that as a mistake

1319
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
or an error that's like i think you know

1320
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,520
a feature not not really a bug um and

1321
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,040
it's just it's just that you know we

1322
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,880
hope that on balance the number of

1323
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
people who received that information and

1324
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,079
had that thought are much less than

1325
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,400
those who saw the news story for example

1326
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,200
the the postcard wasn't the 2000 people

1327
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
that saw the postcard wasn't the wasn't

1328
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,760
the you know key audience it was the 750

1329
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
000 to a million people that saw the

1330
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,839
news story

1331
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,880
thank you all so much thank you

1332
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,439
thank you yeah thank you so much
