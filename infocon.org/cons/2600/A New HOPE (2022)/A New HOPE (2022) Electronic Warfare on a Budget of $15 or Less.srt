1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,239
sunday

2
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
you made it to sunday

3
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,120
good program today right a lot of good

4
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
stuff going on

5
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,079
thank you

6
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,320
thank you

7
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,640
you're still here sleep deprivationists

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
set in pretty thoroughly at this point

9
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,880
might be a little bit of a hangover

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,479
experience for those staying off campus

11
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,200
be uh be careful with that um so so

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
welcome to sunday this is the third day

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
of a new hope we're going to have a

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
closing ceremony at 6 00 pm

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
and following the closing ceremony we'll

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799
do a lot of thank yous and sort of a

17
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
little summary of some of the stuff that

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,280
happened

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
there's going to be a band starting

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
right out here samba band they're going

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
to do a little processional maybe wind

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
out out front have a little bit of a

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,880
block party atmosphere so if you're

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
thinking of leaving early think of

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,759
sticking around

26
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
until then and after the closing

27
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
ceremony and block party thing or

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
actually even during it there'll be a

29
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
lot of cleanup a lot of volunteers are

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,040
needed we have some fairly heavy

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,399
equipment that needs to be moved from a

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
little theater up to our loading dock

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
getting ready for the trucks taking down

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
signs folding tables stuff like that so

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
please do consider sticking around for a

36
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,600
little bit because we can really use

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
that help and as i think you've heard at

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
this point a new hope the whole series

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
of conferences entirely volunteer driven

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
and we get a lot out of this and um if

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
you've been volunteering you know that

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,640
you're getting a lot out of that

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
experience and if you haven't yet you

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,239
still have the opportunity in fact you

45
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
have the opportunity going into tomorrow

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
morning because we've got to load up all

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
those big trucks so if you have

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
opportunity to help with that that would

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
be great you've seen on the rotating

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,959
screen we have some good stuff going on

51
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
in the fourth track so if you're not

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
sure what to do after this take a look

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
at the wiki and see what's happening in

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
the coffee house as well as workshops

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,800
other talks capture the flag talking to

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
vendors all kinds of great stuff so

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
without further ado let's uh welcome

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
lucas and we're going to hear all about

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
conducting electronic warfare on a

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
budget

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,360
[Applause]

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
hi and welcome to conducting electronic

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
warfare on a budget of 15 or less

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
so you are constantly being irradiated

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
by a plethora of gadgets and gizmos that

66
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,239
are firing photons at you from every

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
direction passing through your body

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
so today we're going to try and figure

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
out how to read those airwaves

70
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
uh i'm lucas rikers and i have a

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
background in physics and i've worked as

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
a satellite engineer at a space internet

73
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
company not elon musk's and

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
and also come from a

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
military background and i'm going back

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
to school to do more satellite stuff so

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
i've been informed that due to supply

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
shortages as of late uh some of the

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
equipment i want uh that i demonstrate

80
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
here is no longer available at 15

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,959
and so this talk really ought to be 50

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
or so sorry

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
so this lesson will be broken down into

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
three main parts and by the end of this

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,519
presentation you will know what radios

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,120
are and how they work though this will

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
be review for many of you you will know

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
and understand the tenets of electronic

89
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,599
warfare and their practical applications

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
so counter measures against them counter

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
countermeasures against those

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,239
countermeasures and so on this quickly

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
becomes an uh unending game of cat and

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
mouse as you will see you will also

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
learn how to apply this principles to

96
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
your everyday life to uh use uh

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,000
software-defined radio platforms to

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
listen to all those radio waves that are

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
constantly irradiating you

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,080
so first off what is a radio

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,960
so

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
uh

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
uh depicted on here

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
every photo on this page is radio in

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
fact so starting from the top left we

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
have walkie talkies that use the family

107
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
radio service band larger

108
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
there's a larger dish beside that

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
underneath there the on the tower are

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
cell phone antennas the long white

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
rectangular ones that you see that

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,639
provide cell phone service

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
and correspondingly inside of your phone

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
is the antenna that communicates with

115
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
that cell phone tower i've also included

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
an old fm dial

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
a more military looking radio and a

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
satellite because they have radios too

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
at the bottom there's a block diagram

120
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
that shows you how when a signal goes

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
into the radio how it's processed and

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
turned into something intelligible

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
i've also included on this a magnet and

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
a piece of copper wire

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,160
now the reason for this is from

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
maxwell's equations in the laws of

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
physics

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
we know that if you move a wire around

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
or correction if you move a magnet

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,759
around it will generate an em current so

131
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
if you jostle a magnet at a given

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
frequency you will be generating em

133
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
radiation and photons at that frequency

134
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
just extremely low power

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
similarly if you have a piece of wire

136
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
and you're in a magnetic field say the

137
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
magnetic field of the earth that we

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
experience and start shaking that wire

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
around you will also induce occurrence

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
in the wire and generate radio waves no

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
matter how small

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
so everything on here is a radio to sum

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
that up a radio is just a piece of wire

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
with an oscillating current or an

145
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
alternating current going back and forth

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
jostling radio waves out about out of it

147
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
these can be analog or digital and the

148
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
two main antenna types that we need to

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
concern ourselves with today are

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,840
directed and undirected ones directed

151
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,199
antennae points their field only at a

152
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
particular angle and have a farther

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
reached versus undirected or

154
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
unidirectional antennae spam it

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,759
everywhere but their range is lower

156
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,240
so going over the radio spectrum briefly

157
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
here it is sorted by frequency from high

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
to low

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
the general characteristics you need to

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
know is a lower frequency means longer

161
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,199
waves

162
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
which means more penetration through

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
services but less data throughput

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
and higher frequency means shorter radio

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,039
waves which means you can send a lot

166
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
more data on them

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
but it has less penetration and range

168
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
so

169
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,880
my

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
government gives up the

171
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
the radio spectrum in according to this

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
chart here so we've got starting from

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
very low frequencies at the top going

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
all the way up to uh very high

175
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
frequencies at the bottom this is the

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
usages that are allocated there i've

177
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,120
decided to highlight some of those bands

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
so in the low frequency in the hf range

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
there's the national research council

180
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
time signal

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
so this signal uh is sent out by uh

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
government stations is

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
to update the clocks of various uh

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
autonomous and uh

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
remote uh radio things that need to have

186
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,919
their clocks updated because they don't

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
have internet connections or something

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,479
uh also higher up here in the vhf range

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,800
is the fm radio band highlighted fairly

190
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
large going up uh in the frs span that's

191
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,919
the family radio service so any

192
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
walkie-talkie that you buy will be in

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
this band

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
going up there's the old cellular one

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
highlighted as well as 2.4 and 5

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
gigahertz wi-fi

197
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,560
and

198
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
at the top layer i've also highlighted

199
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
the ku band which is used in satellite

200
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
communications

201
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
due to its extremely high data

202
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
throughput

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
so

204
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,280
here is that spectrum broken again

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
showing you the frequency and the

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
wavelength for the different spectrums

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
so the frequency determines the

208
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
wavelength and this comes from the math

209
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,599
equation the physics equation you see on

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,479
the board where the frequency times the

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
wavelength of any given radio wave must

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
always be equal to the speed of light

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
so the frequency fixes the wavelength

214
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
but the wavelength tells you how long of

215
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
an antenna you'll need to receive that

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,559
signal so the ideal antenna is usually

217
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
the size of the wavelength but barring

218
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,760
that you want it to be half the size or

219
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
a quarter the size uh and so on

220
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
so this isn't just a physics equation

221
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
it's actually practical for soldiers in

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
the field who are often

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
deployed on an operation given several

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
mission specific frequencies at the

225
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
beginning and one general purpose

226
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
antenna that works broadly for a wide

227
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
range of frequencies however in the

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,800
field oftentimes those don't work so

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,480
well and you need to create your own

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
antenna in order to

231
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
receive the signal better so then that

232
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
is that process requires literally just

233
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,800
cutting coax cable uh taking rearranging

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
the equation from the previous page and

235
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
figuring out what antenna you need

236
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
strapping in a tree referred to as field

237
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
expedient antennae

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,519
so that covers what is a radio now we'll

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,000
move on to electronic warfare

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
part two

241
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,760
note this picture is not an accurate

242
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
depiction of modern electronic warfare

243
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
so

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
the tenants of ew invert the traditional

245
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
cia triad of information security so

246
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,920
instead of maintaining the

247
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
confidentiality integrity availability

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
of messages we instead seek to deny

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
service exploit and employ deception

250
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
against our adversaries

251
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
so

252
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
the doctrine of electronic warfare can

253
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
be broken down into three primary

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
branches electronic protection which

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
we'll start with

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
focuses on things like encryption and

257
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
protecting your forces from enemy ew

258
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
capabilities ew attack

259
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,160
seeks to disrupt and deny the usage of

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
the electromagnetic spectrum by

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
adversarial forces

262
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
using jamming or directed energy weapons

263
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
and like ew support is a far more

264
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
intelligence based focus but where you

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
try and gather everything that you can

266
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
every bit of info that you can based on

267
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
all the enemy radio traffic that you can

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
pick up

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
so why is this important because

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,920
communication matters if a battlefield

271
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
commander cannot communicate with their

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
troops they have a series of

273
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
functionally independent armies if

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,880
subordinate units cannot communicate

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
with their superiors then they are

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
unable to see the larger picture which

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
can result in drops of morale and

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
inability to act as a cohesive and

279
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
coordinated organization threat history

280
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
many a battle has been lost as a direct

281
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,640
result of severed communication lines

282
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
and the modern battlefield is chock full

283
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
of communication systems to exploit

284
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
so for the rest of this talk we'll be

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
starting to focus on the count measures

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
and countermeasures and counter counter

287
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,519
measures engaged starting with two basic

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,440
questions how can we listen to other

289
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
people's conversations and how can we

290
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
stop them from doing that to us

291
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
to start off the first thing you want to

292
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
do is encrypt your

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
traffic so that they can't hear it this

294
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
uh works much the same as

295
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
cryptography does in other information

296
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
security systems that you've seen

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but as a historical side note i would

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
like to bring up the first form of radio

299
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
encryption that was employed

300
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
uh so scrambling the airwaves you may

301
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
have heard of this before

302
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
in this picture the human voice spectrum

303
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
so this is audio waves not radio waves

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
goes from 300 hertz to 3 kilohertz and

305
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
in order to hide the traffic from people

306
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
who had regular radios what they would

307
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
do is just invert the uh powers of all

308
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
of the different frequencies so if you

309
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
had a signal that looked like this you

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
just literally flip them around a middle

311
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
axis

312
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,200
this sounds like demonic hissing if you

313
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
are listening to it on a normal radio

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
however this is of course insecure as

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
you only need to know three or so

316
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
parameters in order to undo all most

317
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
types of voice inversion

318
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,839
so

319
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
modern radio encryption works by

320
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
generally distributing keys at a

321
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
facility beforehand on all of the radios

322
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
and then they can be sent out into the

323
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,639
field and crypto material can be updated

324
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,360
on over the air afterwards

325
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,639
so

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
now we've done it we've encrypted our

327
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
traffic and we can freely and openly

328
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
communicate securely without anyone else

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
hearing us

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,320
but

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
now we're going to get to our first

332
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
electronic attack method

333
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
so jamming this is equivalent to

334
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,480
screaming uh at people who are trying to

335
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
have a conversation so they can't hear

336
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
you

337
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
so on the left here we can see

338
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
a unjammed signal which has a nice

339
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
beautiful waveform with all kinds of

340
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
crisp and rich

341
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
substructure and just visible peaks and

342
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,920
on the left we have that same signal but

343
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
being jammed

344
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
so there's a lot to learn from these two

345
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
diagrams the first being that jamming

346
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
can only occur at a particular frequency

347
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
you must know the frequency that yeah

348
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
you want to jam and that your adversary

349
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,959
is likely to use in order for this to

350
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,760
work

351
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
you can't just broadly dump energy you

352
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
can't broadly dump energy all throughout

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,920
the spectrum it won't work so well uh

354
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
and also so as a result of that the

355
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,279
noise floors on the

356
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
sides of these graphs go back down to

357
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,839
zero

358
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,680
so here's another analogy i love to

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,720
describe jamming uh and why just dumping

360
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,959
energy works it's kind of like driving

361
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
home on your commute uh if you drive

362
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
home towards the sunset it's very hard

363
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,800
to see when you're driving towards the

364
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
sun like that and there's lots of glare

365
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,560
and this like might not make sense at

366
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
first because you're you might think oh

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
but if you're adding more light to the

368
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,519
situation shouldn't you be able to see

369
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
more better but all of that light blocks

370
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
it uh as noise effectively and the glare

371
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
prevents you from seeing even though

372
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
things are more illuminated

373
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
i like this analogy because from a

374
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
physics perspective it's completely

375
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
indistinguishable from actual radio

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,880
jamming given that your eyes are radio

377
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,680
antennae that pick up only frequencies

378
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
in a certain band that we refer to as

379
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
the visible range

380
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,560
um

381
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
so broad jamming so you have to do a bit

382
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
of research beforehand of knowing your

383
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
enemy frequencies in order to employ and

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
jamming

385
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
and but you probably just don't want to

386
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
just uh jam the radio network as a whole

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
because then the adversary will simply

388
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,279
change frequencies and you have to keep

389
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,480
doing that

390
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
a then that also alerts them to the

391
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,160
presence of ew attack in the region so a

392
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
more

393
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
effective method is to use directional

394
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,600
jamming to only break certain key links

395
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
if you can figure out what those are

396
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
so

397
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,279
this

398
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
basically will just look more like an

399
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
individual's radio broke rather than

400
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,519
them being alerted that the entire

401
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
spectrum is being jammed

402
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
and can be turned on during critical

403
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,920
times to your advantage

404
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,959
so

405
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
we've encrypted our comms so now no one

406
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
can read them and now we can also

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
selectively jam our enemies to our

408
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,920
advantage

409
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,680
but unfortunately they can jam us

410
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
so

411
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,959
how do we deal with that direction

412
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,519
finding antenna if we can when someone

413
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
like i said this is like screaming over

414
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
people's conversations so if you can

415
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,959
just hear where that's coming from you

416
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
can send a missile that way and now the

417
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
jamming's dealt with

418
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
so this is done with direction finding

419
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
antenna using a one direction finding

420
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
antenna you can find what direction they

421
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
are with two or more you can start to

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
triangulate them as in this photo

423
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,079
and

424
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
here's a brief overview of how these

425
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
antennae work because a regular piece of

426
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,440
wire has no idea where the signal is

427
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
coming from it can only determine the

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,519
relative strength given how directed it

429
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
is so directional antennae will

430
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
generally have a series of antennae in a

431
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,639
circle

432
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,560
that are directed and just calculate the

433
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,680
relative signal strength based on that

434
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
so giving you the direction of

435
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
transmission so now we can talk with

436
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
encrypted comms and they can't

437
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
understand us we can jam them and they

438
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,440
can jam us but if they do jam us we can

439
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
find out where they are

440
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
how do we prevent

441
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
the adversaries from finding out where

442
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,959
we are

443
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,759
well don't stay on the same frequency

444
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,440
and change it hundreds of times per

445
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,399
second

446
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,279
so

447
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
this works against a variety of attacks

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
including jamming uh detection generally

449
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
and direction finding

450
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
how this works is pre-shared keys are

451
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
distributed on the radios that are

452
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
plugged into a cipher

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,440
that just generates the list of

454
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
frequencies that you want and there's

455
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
some time synchronization stuff i don't

456
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,320
fully understand

457
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
this is used also in

458
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
civilian applications lots and things

459
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,240
like cdma or

460
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,799
code division multiplex accessing a long

461
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
acronym but it is used in bluetooth to

462
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
help your bluetooth devices alternate

463
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
which frequencies they're using and like

464
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,760
lower interference with that

465
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,679
why does this work so well

466
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
one principle is that a radio can only

467
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,839
ever be tuned to a single frequency at a

468
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,720
time

469
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
so if you're searching for enemy

470
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
frequencies then you will generally

471
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
sweep starting from high to low tuning

472
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
your radio up and trying to catch bits

473
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
but if you're sweeping in a pattern like

474
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,280
this and they're dotting around

475
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
everywhere the odds that you'll

476
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
intercept any traffic become

477
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
increasingly low and even if they do

478
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
it's encrypted so that's good

479
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
so we've encrypted our comms we can jam

480
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,080
them direction finally enemies and now

481
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
we're now frequency hopping to hide our

482
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
own signal

483
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
but let's suppose that the adversaries

484
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
are also doing the same

485
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,000
what analysis can be done on those tiny

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
bits of encrypted radio traffic that we

487
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
do catch

488
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,039
uh

489
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,760
all kinds one

490
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
hot area of research

491
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
is

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,200
on focuses on the rising edge curves of

493
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
the radios so when a radio starts up uh

494
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
that process is depicted in this diagram

495
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
here on the left the rf level is at the

496
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
noise floor and as the oscillator turns

497
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,280
on we have this rising edge curve before

498
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
reaching the reference level sending its

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
signal and then turning off

500
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,760
when the oscillator starts turning on

501
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
there are all kinds of features of this

502
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,919
curve that are very unique to the

503
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,480
individual transmitter and putting this

504
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
into things like machine learning and

505
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
doing other analysis can allow you to

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
uniquely identify

507
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
transmitters so you can figure out is

508
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
this one guy driving around generating

509
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
the traffic of a convoy or is this a

510
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,360
bunch of

511
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
unique radio units

512
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,760
this process essentially measures the

513
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
engineering tolerances on the

514
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
manufacturing process of the radio

515
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
because you can often just with radios

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
that are produced on the same

517
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
manufacturing line you can uniquely

518
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,679
identify which transmitter is which so

519
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,280
there is still a bit of quite a bit of

520
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
information even if you can't get the

521
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
content of the message you can at least

522
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
figure out things like who's

523
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,720
transmitting and where are they moving

524
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,960
so let's say we want to prevent this

525
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,440
from happening at all how can we get

526
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
prevent the enemy from even getting

527
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,799
these tiny little blips of our encrypted

528
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,760
traffic

529
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
well the answer is to simply wish upon a

530
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
shooting star

531
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,720
really

532
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
so meteor burst coms probably one of my

533
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
favorite esoteric radio communication

534
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
methods involves waiting for a meteor to

535
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
come streaming down through the

536
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
atmosphere heating up and leaving in its

537
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
wake a large pile of ions leaving the

538
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,200
atmosphere electrically charged in that

539
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,320
region

540
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
so radio signals from someone who's just

541
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,559
waiting for shooting stars to fall can

542
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,440
be bounced off of this layer

543
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
at which point the signal goes up from

544
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
or from transmitter to the meteor to the

545
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
receiver and very low chance of

546
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
interception in between

547
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
this is primarily used by remote science

548
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,799
stations where they're just sending back

549
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,080
auto or

550
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
info autonomy or autonomously or by

551
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,679
operators who are working in places they

552
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,360
really don't want to transmit

553
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
for as many of you may know this

554
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
principle can be

555
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,600
generalized uh to give us hf radio

556
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
so the sun streaming down all of its

557
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,760
energy onto our planet

558
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,280
rips at a certain layer in the

559
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
atmosphere all of the electrons off of

560
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
there uh

561
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
creating ions and what we call the

562
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,240
ionosphere this changes its

563
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,679
characteristics and shape throughout the

564
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
day depending on how hot the sun is and

565
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
uh

566
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
different things about solar weather but

567
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
the basic principle is that you can if

568
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,280
you know your frequency and where you're

569
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
trying to reach you can bounce the

570
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,919
signal

571
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,760
right off of the ionosphere and it'll go

572
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
back down and reflect around the earth

573
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
several times generally allowing for

574
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,039
worldwide communications via radio

575
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,280
the problem with this include skip zones

576
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
as depicted here so when the signal is

577
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
going up and bouncing down there will be

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
skip zones where it's not

579
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
easy to pick up this makes hf

580
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,240
communications uh quite tricky

581
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,799
and i always found it to be a bit of a

582
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,720
black magic from my perspective to get

583
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
all of this stuff right

584
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
but the principle of hf radio can also

585
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,159
be applied to radar

586
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
so instead of for communications you

587
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,559
send a signal which bounces off of the

588
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,120
ionosphere and over the horizon and when

589
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
it comes back you measure the difference

590
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
and if you're doing this for long enough

591
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,080
you can see uh that aircraft the

592
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
aircraft will create particular shadows

593
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
in these images allowing you to detect

594
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
this is how uh certain uh norad systems

595
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,640
and

596
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
uh stuff work to detect planes over the

597
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,600
horizon this particular photo is of the

598
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
duga russia or sorry the duga radio

599
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
installation for over the horizon radar

600
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,360
in russia close to chernobyl i included

601
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
two photos of it because it looks really

602
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
fun to climb

603
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,080
so

604
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,880
uh

605
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
why haven't i brought up satcoms yet uh

606
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
because satellites can of course pass

607
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
overhead directly every 50 minutes and

608
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,360
give you high bandwidth and

609
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,159
transmission and can discretely get data

610
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,120
around plus the military uh created gps

611
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
and employs satellites all and all

612
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,799
throughout its operations for

613
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
communication purposes

614
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,679
however

615
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,520
there are lots of reasons that a

616
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
military would want to maintain their

617
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,320
high frequency radio capabilities

618
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,520
and one of them is kessler syndrome

619
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
the rundown if one tiny screw hits a

620
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
satellite it explodes into 50 pieces

621
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
those 50 pieces hit another 50

622
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
satellites which explode into 50 more

623
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,559
pieces each the end result is that the

624
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,480
exosphere becomes a spinning male storm

625
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
of space junk that entombs us in a

626
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
casket of jagged metal for decades

627
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
and this photo here is provided by the

628
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
european space agency and this shows

629
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
every single piece of space junk that

630
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,679
they are tracking that is greater than

631
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
one millimeter in size

632
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
so there are reasons that you would want

633
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
to maintain capabilities other than

634
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,480
statcoms

635
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,520
now going into more esoteric

636
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
communications methods

637
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,000
bringing up extremely low frequency

638
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
communications which are often used to

639
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
talk to submarines

640
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,240
so i've included a little clip of that

641
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
chart from the first page so if you look

642
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
that

643
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
vlf

644
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
uh very low frequency and elf extremely

645
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
low frequency uh

646
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,320
have very very long antennae so

647
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
setting up the antenna on the ground is

648
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
fairly easy you just string a wire

649
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
that's multiple kilometers long and pump

650
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
an ungodly amount of power into it

651
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
now on the receiving end the submarines

652
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
what they do is trail a cable behind

653
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,159
them with a boy that you can see

654
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,720
depicted there and then that generally

655
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
is designed so that it isn't picked up

656
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,400
by sonar and

657
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
since the submarines themselves can't

658
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
transmit well they

659
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,559
that is basically used as a signal for

660
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,320
hey come up to an area where we can talk

661
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,679
to you better

662
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,600
these of course

663
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
being low frequency have an

664
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
extraordinarily low data rate often

665
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
measured in baud

666
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
one bonus method

667
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
for encrypted for discrete radio

668
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
communications is number stations

669
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,799
so numbers this is when a

670
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,799
government organization will set up a

671
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,960
radio tower that is

672
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
audible and you can pick up the signal

673
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
from other countries and other places

674
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
and the only thing being broadcast is

675
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
usually someone reading numbers

676
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,120
very creepily in a voice 24 7 for hours

677
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,679
and these numbers are random mostly

678
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,559
maybe

679
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,679
um but in the host country the

680
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
clandestine operatives will be given a

681
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,039
code book and toe and told uh listen

682
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,400
start listening to the radio at these

683
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
times 10 a.m on tuesday morning start

684
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,559
just writing down the numbers and then

685
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
look that up in your code book and they

686
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,240
would distribute messages that way

687
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,159
before the internet

688
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,080
so that brings us to the end of part two

689
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
and for part three we'll start talking

690
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
about software defined radio here are a

691
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
bunch of them i know many of you in the

692
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
audience have these toys at home

693
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
but these are commercially available

694
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
ones and the one in the bottom right is

695
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,840
a few thousand times more expensive but

696
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
still an sdr

697
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,919
what is a software defined radio

698
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
it differs from a regular radio as

699
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,159
regular radio has custom-built circuitry

700
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
for its task and fm radio will have the

701
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
fm modulator built in the circuitry

702
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
however an sd-r will just receive the

703
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
signal and you write a computer program

704
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,440
then it allows you to simulate all of

705
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
that circuitry so although it's more

706
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
inefficient from an energy perspective

707
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
you the reprogrammability is very useful

708
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
uh on the left is just that radial block

709
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,799
diagram from the first page showing you

710
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
uh i think that's an fm demodulator and

711
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,360
then on the right is a gnu radio block

712
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,080
diagram where gnu radio is a program

713
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,559
that allows you to essentially build

714
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
these rf

715
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
circuits by putting all of the blocks

716
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,480
together as software

717
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
the sdr i'm going to recommend i've

718
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
heard that the prices have changed

719
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
recently due to supply chain shortage

720
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
and other corona issues

721
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
the this is a software-defined radio

722
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
that's extremely cheap

723
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,200
extremely accessible and has such a good

724
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
range of frequencies out of the start uh

725
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
500 kilohertz just can't quite get to

726
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,039
wi-fi but you can go even lower or

727
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,240
higher if you have an up or down

728
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,679
converter a popular one is the ham it up

729
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,840
uh this was made by a tv tuner and i'm

730
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
fairly certain that the guys just bought

731
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,840
the factory where this tv tuner was

732
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
being made and then uh altered the uh

733
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,120
design until and then just yeah started

734
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
just producing there to spot the factory

735
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
um so this is great because this is like

736
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
really the first entry in like the

737
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
actual real budget uh software defined

738
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,279
radio world because before this you

739
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,320
would have had to spend thousands of

740
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,279
dollars you would have had to get your

741
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,880
employer to spend thousands of dollars

742
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
on a usrp that you can maybe take home

743
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
sometimes

744
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,480
so you there are many many things that

745
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,240
are within that even though it's banned

746
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,159
is fairly limited there's all kinds of

747
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,919
stuff that you can listen to this is a

748
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,320
very plug and play thing you can uh most

749
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,600
once you get all the installing and

750
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
drivers done you can just start

751
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,480
listening to signals

752
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,279
so

753
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,720
going over some of those uh airplanes

754
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
have a lot of antennae on them too

755
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,840
the

756
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,760
boeing 747 has over 40 antennae on it

757
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,200
not all of them are listed on here

758
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
because there are some duplicates and

759
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
other ones

760
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,440
so

761
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
what signals can we pick up from an

762
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
airplane

763
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,880
uh ads and b is the first one this

764
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,320
stands for the automatic dependent

765
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
surveillance broadcast is broadcast at

766
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
1090 megahertz and this gives you the

767
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,799
gps coordinates of planes uh just let

768
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,000
they don't crash into each other in the

769
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
air traffic controllers knowing knowing

770
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,880
what's going on

771
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
but fortunately with all this data if

772
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
you live close enough to an airport you

773
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
can just plot it into a map there exists

774
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,279
many myriad programs to do so and one of

775
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
my favorite websites and community radio

776
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,880
projects for this is the dictator

777
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,679
tractor where they just track the uh

778
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,919
plate or they attract the adsb info of

779
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
known planes of dictators to just find

780
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,760
out what they're up to in the world

781
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,840
uh also from planes are pilot text

782
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
messages also referred to as the

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
aircraft communication addressing and

784
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,159
reporting system

785
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,880
these this is mostly uh routine boring

786
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,960
stuff but there's all kinds of

787
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
interesting special requests that you

788
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,799
can hear for example special requests

789
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
from particularly pernicious celebrities

790
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,279
onboard an airplane and other local

791
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,360
drama unfolding at the terminal

792
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
uh here are some a car's modulator

793
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
programs that

794
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,840
you can just get the output from

795
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
ais works like ads and b but is for

796
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,679
boats so all boats over a certain size

797
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,760
require the automatic identification

798
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,960
system tags even if they don't actually

799
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
have them this allows you to map out

800
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
fishing fleets and the like on maps very

801
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
similar to the planes

802
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,919
uh pager messages are very fun very

803
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,159
diverse in what you'll see uh the

804
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
protocols here are

805
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
the old classic one is called pog sag

806
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,840
but there's other protocols like flex

807
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,799
and tap

808
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
these this you'll get all kinds of

809
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,559
alarms from automated security systems

810
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,440
fire alarms for volunteer firefighters

811
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
uh pager messages for doctors and other

812
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,480
medical staff etc there is a wide

813
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
variety of things that still use pagers

814
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
very wonderful

815
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
if none of this stuff on earth is your

816
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,960
thing you can also use this 15 sdr to do

817
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
radio astronomy

818
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
although it did require the building for

819
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
the creator of this they had to build

820
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
that horde antenna that you see on the

821
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,679
left in order to listen to the astronomy

822
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,240
stuff they were able to with the 15 str

823
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,279
pick up the 21 centimeter hydrogen line

824
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
from the center of the milky way galaxy

825
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
with him

826
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
so if space isn't your thing and hacking

827
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
is you can also turn it into an mz

828
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,360
catcher which as many of you are

829
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,039
familiar with uh as lee device that

830
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,279
simulates the cell phone tower uh

831
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,600
man in the middle essentially to read

832
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,799
your text messages this uh if you

833
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
download this github repo that's linked

834
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
here this will allow you to track the

835
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,640
cell phones in your area and see who's

836
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
coming and going and when and where

837
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
however in order to decrypt text

838
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,399
messages such as your own you do have to

839
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,919
extract the key from your phone and put

840
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,760
it into the program it's a bit of a

841
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
hassle

842
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,440
so moving away from traditional hacking

843
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,159
to

844
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,039
more

845
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
uh governmental concerns

846
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
tempest is an acronym that stands for

847
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
telecommunications and electronic

848
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,679
materials protected from emanating

849
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,520
spurious transmissions

850
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,679
what this is saying is as i mentioned

851
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
before a magnet moving or a wire moving

852
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,679
and relative to a magnetic field is

853
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,240
radio and will generate a current so all

854
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,840
of the wires uh

855
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,440
coming out in and out of your computer

856
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
all of the even your monitor oscillating

857
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,720
at 60 hertz or 120 hertz refresh rate is

858
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,120
also a radio so

859
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,399
a good hacking question is what can be

860
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,720
learned from someone's computer by just

861
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
putting a radio next to it the answer is

862
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
a lot as tempest is also the name of

863
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,360
this person's github repo where they

864
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,760
show these principles with the rtl sdr

865
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,679
here

866
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
hooked up to that monitor with the

867
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,919
checker background and then the antenna

868
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,159
in the long

869
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,399
on the back there behind it on the left

870
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,399
screen is the signal

871
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,120
the reconstructed like monitor output

872
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,159
from

873
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,519
the sdrs received signal so as you can

874
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,840
see you can now with an sdr find out

875
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
what someone

876
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
what someone's monitor is saying and

877
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
also kind of scary given that

878
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,399
essentially your monitor is also

879
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,000
radiating what you see on the screen

880
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,519
behind it

881
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,399
uh

882
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
you can also do badge reading this

883
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,039
example was taken by uh from an edis

884
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,000
research

885
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
uh

886
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,760
this one you'll need a usrp or something

887
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,159
more expensive in order to do but you

888
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,360
can read

889
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,000
badges and potentially play them back

890
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,559
and intercept badge keys

891
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,320
but in order to do that in order to do

892
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
playback we have to transmit and

893
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,600
this is where it gets expensive so even

894
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,919
for the rtl sdr is great because the

895
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,720
next higher options start to uh just go

896
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,399
up in price although they do have

897
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,480
transmit capabilities

898
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
so instead of pointing you towards lowes

899
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
which you i'm sure that anyone

900
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,279
interested in sdrs can research in the

901
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,440
runtime i will instead

902
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
show you the cheap way

903
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,519
this is another github repo called

904
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,240
raspberry pi tx that allows you to use

905
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,760
the gpio pin to send signals from 5

906
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
kilohertz to 1.5 gigahertz

907
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,760
however this is uh extremely uh not a

908
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
good idea to necessarily do without a

909
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,039
bandpass filter and uh other precautions

910
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,000
to make sure that you're not

911
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,440
transmitting illegally as uh it does

912
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,799
spread a lot of energy all over the

913
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,360
spectrum despite its short range there

914
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,039
are lots of fun applications for this

915
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,279
including sending images over the

916
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,120
spectrogram as in the picture on the

917
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,159
right there and personally i use it for

918
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,320
my nephews just like taking over the fm

919
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,559
radio to say stuff to their parents

920
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
whenever i go home

921
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,120
so

922
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,000
the sdr software you can use there is a

923
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,320
plethora of that i've included just one

924
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
screenshot of one that i like called

925
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,480
cubic sdr

926
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
and they all basically look like this

927
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
different combinations of waterfall

928
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,919
diagrams and

929
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,279
they'll often have different built-in

930
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,760
demodulators and they allow you to just

931
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,679
start exploring the spectrum it's great

932
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,519
to just download all of these in any of

933
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,919
them and just start finding seeing what

934
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,679
signals you can find

935
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
also another good mention is the

936
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
universal

937
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
radio hacker resource so that is an

938
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,039
application that launched recently that

939
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,039
allows you to if you

940
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,120
don't know the protocol of a message you

941
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,679
can start to figure it out and decode

942
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,279
the protocol and write your own

943
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,080
dissector for it essentially so that

944
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,760
these all the other programs are

945
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,159
generally just uh

946
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:04,960
more

947
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,279
just straight receiving programs

948
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,239
so

949
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,479
any questions

950
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:23,299
[Applause]

951
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,560
there's a nice microphone back there

952
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
good lighting too

953
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,719
no questions explained everything good

954
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,719
nice

955
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,440
not that i would ever do this but

956
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,119
um is there a way to

957
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,760
hear what's happening on a

958
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,240
encrypted digital p25 system

959
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,640
not that you would know that

960
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,400
uh sorry p25 i forget which uh protocol

961
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,599
i know i've seen that before is that

962
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,640
like

963
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,960
is that related to dmr or no

964
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
yeah

965
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,320
yeah that's that's like a motorola one

966
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,839
uh yeah unfortunately i don't have

967
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,680
enough knowledge about that specifically

968
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
thank you

969
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,880
um

970
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
uh i just want to say that

971
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,680
there's a another sdr called hacker off

972
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
and there's a standalone like a unit

973
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
that makes it stand alone called the

974
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,040
porter pack and apparently a bunch of

975
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
chinese knockoffs came out and they're

976
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
really cheap they come with everything

977
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
together like you can find them like

978
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
aliexpress or something so if somebody

979
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
wants to mess with like and that

980
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,839
transmits as well but it's simplex so

981
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,599
it's you can't transmit and receive

982
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,560
simultaneously

983
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,960
well yes that's excellent suggestion

984
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,800
please or sorry what was the name of it

985
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,480
again you said it's a hacker a new

986
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
hacker uh hacker ref but don't look for

987
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,520
hacker wrapped look for portapak

988
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,160
p-p-o-r-t-a

989
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
pack p-a-c-k as one word

990
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,079
and uh the ones on like aliexpress

991
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,160
if it if it says that it's comes already

992
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,079
in the case that means it must already

993
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,599
come with a hacker off

994
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,040
scr and

995
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,200
usually with batteries already pre-built

996
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
and it's insanely cheap considering that

997
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,079
individually it'll cost around 500 bucks

998
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,320
but online is the cheap chinese

999
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,520
knockoffs which

1000
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
are it's an open source design so it's

1001
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
virtually the same uh it's like it's

1002
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
under 200 bucks which is insanely like a

1003
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
lower price so this is what i love is

1004
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
that this world just keeps getting

1005
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,240
better and better before this doing this

1006
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
hobby would have been extremely

1007
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,359
expensive for example 30 years ago but

1008
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,880
as time goes on we keep getting cheaper

1009
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
and cheaper and more fun toys

1010
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,359
sorry yeah are you familiar with the

1011
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,520
flipper zero and if so what's your take

1012
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
on it yeah yes i've seen people running

1013
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,200
around with those in the hat and the

1014
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,960
hardware workshop

1015
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
there'll be tons of radio stuff there

1016
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,640
all yeah lots of the radios i showed on

1017
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
this presentation people have these set

1018
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,320
up if you guys go to the hacker or to

1019
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,240
the hardware area and i'm sure they'll

1020
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,640
be very happy to show you

1021
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,520
hi i like silly stories so i was curious

1022
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,599
what is the weirdest or most unexpected

1023
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
thing you found that you're comfortable

1024
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
telling us about

1025
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
pardon

1026
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,520
uh

1027
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,839
found sorry like like listened to or

1028
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
heard or discovered uh honestly just

1029
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,520
doing uh setting up hf is just awesome

1030
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
like when you're trying to set up that

1031
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,320
and like communicate with someone

1032
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
because then you like wind up hearing

1033
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
well like i always wondered well how

1034
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
come hf is sort of like hard for the

1035
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,119
military it seems but then all the ham

1036
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,400
people have it easy cool because i think

1037
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
like they're just

1038
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,119
like largely talking to like kind of

1039
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,800
anyone they can so like when you pick up

1040
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
all of those stray signals like

1041
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
singaporean fishermen and stuff that's

1042
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,160
great so yeah definitely definitely all

1043
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,640
the random hf traffic that which is

1044
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
great because that traffic anyone can

1045
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,599
listen to if you just set the antenna

1046
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,200
out

1047
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
a quick question on just a practical

1048
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
application you did cover all the things

1049
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
involved but

1050
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,480
uh with say a 27 megahertz remote

1051
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
control car signal what what would you

1052
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,040
use to decode that or

1053
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
um

1054
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
figure out the what they're using as far

1055
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,960
as signal goes and then possibly use

1056
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,280
something generic to

1057
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
reproduce it

1058
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,240
uh so my preferred toolkit for

1059
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
demodulating signals and like figuring

1060
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
out their protocols and stuff is

1061
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,560
definitely universal radio hacker but in

1062
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
terms of the sdr just link whatever one

1063
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
i have on hand that works best like you

1064
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,079
know if you start getting higher

1065
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,000
sampling rates and stuff that obviously

1066
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,079
helps your case a lot more uh and like

1067
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,079
more expensive ones but

1068
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,280
often we are budget constrained

1069
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,119
thank you for uh sharing today i thought

1070
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,240
your talk was extremely riveting and

1071
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
constantly moving i was struggling to

1072
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,720
keep up a bit but i loved it and it's

1073
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
your teaching method is really great do

1074
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,119
you have a youtube channel instagram or

1075
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,079
anything where i can get more

1076
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,520
information from you because i like your

1077
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
teaching style

1078
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,839
uh

1079
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,320
no actually

1080
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,400
how can how can we reach out to you for

1081
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
questions or further stuff or are you

1082
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
just invisible oh jeez yeah is my email

1083
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
on here yeah i don't know you can

1084
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
probably email me or if you like google

1085
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
my name i'm super like unique last name

1086
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
uh so it's like there's like random arch

1087
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
linux commits and stuff that have my

1088
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
email

1089
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,320
right i guess i could put that up james

1090
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,040
yeah well thank you

1091
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,760
hey uh you talked about putting a

1092
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
bandpass filter on the output video of a

1093
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
raspberry pi

1094
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
can you say more about how you actually

1095
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
do that

1096
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,640
pardon me

1097
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
uh you talked about a bad pass filter

1098
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
for the radio output with the raspberry

1099
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,280
pi if i caught that right

1100
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,520
uh yeah sorry i was saying or sorry what

1101
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,359
i meant to say was uh

1102
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,640
you shouldn't operate it without a

1103
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,480
bandpass filter due to the spectrum

1104
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,760
leakage whether or not that's like

1105
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
feasible to add on to the radio and

1106
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,560
whether or not using a raspberry pi as a

1107
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
radio is

1108
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,280
legal i you have to check your local

1109
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,920
regulations

1110
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
but the range of it is like if you're

1111
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,880
broadcasting in the ism bands and like

1112
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,160
you're doing something to filter out the

1113
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
frequencies like the range of it's like

1114
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
10 centimeters so it's like not super

1115
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,359
powerful anyways

1116
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,319
yeah

1117
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,599
sorry that doesn't answer your question

1118
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
how do you pronounce your last name

1119
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,200
uh well so i think people in north

1120
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,440
america will say yeah like roy eckers or

1121
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,160
rue acres uh either it's fine i'm what

1122
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,480
goddard's law be conservative and what

1123
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
you send permissive and what you accept

1124
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,240
uh just whatever it's obvious you're

1125
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,640
referring to me

1126
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,770
cool well thank you so much

1127
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,869
[Music]

1128
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:23,330
[Music]

1129
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,319
hmm
