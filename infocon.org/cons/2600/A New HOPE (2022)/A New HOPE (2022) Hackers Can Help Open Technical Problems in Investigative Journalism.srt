00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
problems in investigative journalism by

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
brandon roberts brandon will be joining

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
us through a virtual zoom if you can

rest in peace you dirty mofo

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
okay um yes this is called hackers can

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
help open problems in investigative

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,239
journalism

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
i'm a data journalist my name is brandon

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
roberts

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
um i specialize in data heavy

64
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,239
investigative projects um i collaborate

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
with a lot of newsrooms i'm independent

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,800
so i don't have an employer but i do

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
work with a lot of

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
large and small news organizations

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
recent work i've done with propublica

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
newsday associated press and then also

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
some local organizations like

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
oregon public broadcasting

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,680
and seattle times i'm based in western

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
washington

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,159
um

76
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
yeah and basically i'm self-taught

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
i didn't go to school for any of this

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,080
stuff

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
for many years i i had you know i had

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
more computer skills and i had

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
journalism skills and i really wanted to

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
apply them to journalism but it took me

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
a really long time to figure out what

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,959
kinds of things are actually useful to

85
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,440
journalists and the way i did that was

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
trial and error um you know just

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,519
smashing my head against my laptop for

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,360
you know almost a decade

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
um this talk is going to

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
not prevent you from doing that

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
hopefully um i'm going to go through

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
problems that

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,120
journalists face

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
particularly data journalists

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
and

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,080
you know point out things that you know

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
if you have techno technical skills um

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
you'd be very useful

99
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,480
so and good ways to get involved in your

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,120
local journalism community as well

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
okay

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
okay so

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,358
when i was uh when i was started and

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,680
other people that i talked to a lot of

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320
like cs type things other conferences

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
non-journalism conferences and people

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
are doing something related to news

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,479
most of the time it's one of these

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,520
things

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,759
they're analyzing news they're building

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
bias detectors

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,759
um they're working with like you know

113
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,600
non-governmental data so like you know

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
like the rumor mill twitter data stuff

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
like that user generated content

116
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
and they're doing kind of like

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,360
simplistic um

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
simplistic analyses that just are not

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
useful um

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
yeah like

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
journalists we work with primary sources

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,639
um

123
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
we you know we we do records requests we

124
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
get data and we know what kind of data

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,880
we are

126
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
going to get because we typically know

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
what we're going to

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,039
like look for if we're doing police

129
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
investigations we're going to ask for

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
police misconduct data or use of force

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
we know what we're looking for and we're

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
asking for that so techniques that are

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,080
just very general and will tell you like

134
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
this data set is generally about these

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,800
things um usually not very useful

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
um

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
most journalists are looking for you

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,880
know that needle in the haystack or

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
um

140
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
just

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
you know looking for a really specific

142
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
kind of thing um so

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
a lot of these

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
um a lot of these technologies are not

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
useful um i have this example here

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
this little bias detector i see these

147
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
all the time i just think they're really

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
funny

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
um

150
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
because it's like this is like supposed

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
to be very neutral and then you know

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
it's annotated better than not reading

153
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,680
news at all which is like a very very

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
subjective thing

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
so this is the kind of stuff i did when

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
i got started

157
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
um this is not i don't do any of these

158
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
things anymore

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
um okay so

160
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
why this talk

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
i did a github search for news bias

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
detector got 23 repos you know a bunch

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
of random code snippets and search hits

164
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
basically related to this

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
um the thing about those bias detectors

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
too anything related to climate

167
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,639
instantly just goes straight over to the

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,759
left wing

169
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,759
extremism if you talk about budget

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
they're going to put that as you know

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,199
right-wing so it's more like i don't

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
know they're just it's not very useful

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
um russian troll this was a big thing a

174
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
few years ago people wanted to do a

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
russian troll detector

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,639
on 538 the newsroom they have their own

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
this is just absurd

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
what's the difference between a russian

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
troll and just someone who's like really

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
passionate about you know whatever

181
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,639
political thing

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
it's just it's very hard to to figure

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,599
that out

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
um particularly in an automated way

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
and then

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
yeah this like it's just it's not useful

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
um here's something that is useful

188
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,960
though records requests

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
foia tools that you know help

190
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,039
journalists do records requests and

191
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
manage foia

192
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
barely any repositories around this

193
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
and uh

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
every news room every journal is

195
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
technical or not has to do records

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,800
requests um that's like you know it's a

197
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,400
huge part of the game

198
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,080
um and the fact that there's just so

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
little on github about that just kind of

200
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
shows

201
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,599
um the lack of like literacy amongst

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,960
technical people

203
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
for journalists

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
um specifically

205
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
records requests within like the

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
journalism community it's like almost a

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
running joke

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
that like every journalist has their own

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,919
foia tool the new york times reportedly

210
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
had like four internal foia tools

211
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
so not only are we like reinventing the

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
wheel as an industry um individual

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
newsrooms are also reinventing the wheel

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
internally

215
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
okay

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
and these are the things that data

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
journalists actually do

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
we scrape data we request data we gather

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
data from government agencies and

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
corporations when possible um it's not

221
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
always possible but you know that's

222
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
where scraping comes in

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,799
and once we have our data

224
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
we need to extract um you know

225
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
meaningful machine readable information

226
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,440
from it so that's either extracting data

227
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
from a pdf it's doing something like ocr

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,040
or handwriting analysis

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,839
basically turning human readable data

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,240
into machine readable data

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
and then on the right here we have

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
building data sets it's kind of like

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
the final

234
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
thing the final step that you do

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
when you're uh gathering data and all

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
this um

237
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
these are what i call the tools of the

238
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
trade of data journalism these are the

239
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
things that we do these are the things

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
that we need help with

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
so

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,399
the rest of the talk i'm going to go

243
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,880
into these in detail and talk about the

244
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
problems

245
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
talk about our needs and you know if you

246
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
have ideas about this kind of stuff we

247
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
need you

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
okay yeah and like i said we need your

249
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
help so

250
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
data journalists you people who are like

251
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
the top of the game you know these are

252
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,680
the most technical people um in the

253
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,040
industry

254
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
not just like a random reporter from a

255
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
small newsroom who might not be

256
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
technical i'm talking about data

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
journalists who are like are supposed to

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
be pros

259
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,920
um amongst us you know we all have our

260
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,839
own

261
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
like cobbled together scraper scripts

262
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
they're trash trash code you know just

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
trying to get them done quickly

264
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
um

265
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
we all have our own like we manage our

266
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
own selenium stocks because we need

267
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
browsers automated browsers so like you

268
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
can't just uh

269
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
you need a headless browser so you need

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
to have a whole stack so we all have

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
that we all do that ourselves

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,600
um we all have like countless one-off

273
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,079
throwaway extractor scripts so i need to

274
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,560
get specific information out of this one

275
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
pdf i'm going to write a script for that

276
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
you know just thousands and thousands of

277
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
um code snippets just thrown away we all

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
do it

279
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
um and then we all participate in like

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
large amounts of manual tedious data

281
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
entry or transcription and stuff like

282
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,480
that and we're all reinventing the wheel

283
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
very little code sharing because the

284
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
code we're writing is so specific to the

285
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
problem

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
um

287
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
yeah so

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
there's just so much room for

289
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
improvement here

290
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
reinventing the wheel is going to be a

291
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
common theme that you're gonna you're

292
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
gonna see here

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
um

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,839
the reason why i think

295
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
our code is like this like why sloppy

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
why we don't share is because we're on

297
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
deadlines we're trying to get stuff done

298
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,480
fast and uh that's just not

299
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
you know it's not a great environment

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
for like writing like a great library

301
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
that everyone's gonna use and share

302
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
okay

303
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
all right so

304
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
data journalism

305
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,519
as a scientific-ish

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,040
process

307
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
um i just want to kind of sketch out how

308
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
how we do our work

309
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
um

310
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
you know like breaking news and other

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
forms of news it's a lot less structured

312
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
you know it's kind of like reaction to

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
an event you know you dig in you get

314
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
context erase stories whatever

315
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
data journalism works a different a

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,760
little differently it's a little slower

317
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
um you know so i'll break it up into

318
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
these three phases um hypothesis you

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
know uh what is our idea what are we

320
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
investigating can start with a tip a

321
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,839
rumor just a hunch you know i think oh i

322
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
think that certain people might be

323
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
evading campaign finance rules in a

324
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
specific way that's an idea that i can

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
test

326
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
once i have this idea you know i'll

327
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,079
gather data to uh to you know see if i

328
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,519
was right or wrong or see what's

329
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
actually going on um if i think that the

330
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
police in my area are like you know

331
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
beating people up

332
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
um i would gather use of force data if i

333
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
think police are arresting people

334
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
unfairly maybe i'll scrape the municipal

335
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
court um database

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
so that's where the web scraping comes

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
in

338
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,399
or you know request information from

339
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
them

340
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
then i would have to extract it get it

341
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
into something that i can use an

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,920
algorithm to uh to analyze

343
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
um and then

344
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
once i have the data you know i can

345
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,560
actually do an analysis on it then i

346
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,639
would check my hypothesis

347
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
are people breaking the law are the

348
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,880
police you know beating up people like

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
you know then i can test

350
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,200
so we gather data we use tools to

351
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
process that data

352
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
and then we check um check our you know

353
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
check our suspicions see what's up

354
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,440
and then you know that repeats itself

355
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
just because you're using data doesn't

356
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
mean that

357
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,120
your method is science it doesn't mean

358
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
that your method is flawless

359
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
all data has limits it's very important

360
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,519
to know the limits of the data that

361
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,279
you're working with

362
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,639
and

363
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,240
you yourself

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,279
can be a very strong and powerful source

365
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,639
of bias

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,279
it's very easy to you know when you're

367
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
going through files um

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
extracting stuff you know you can easily

369
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,680
you know put your finger on the scale a

370
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
little bit you know so it's really

371
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
important to be thorough and to be

372
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
honest and to do things in like a

373
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
repeatable way and that's why having

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
tools that are shareable

375
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
is important because then other people

376
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
can do the same

377
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,040
the same

378
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,320
experiment you know the same

379
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,680
investigation and get the same results

380
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,279
um just some definitions

381
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
a csv a comma separated values file

382
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,760
um

383
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
we love these as data journalists

384
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
basically the goal of most

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,920
investigations is take some data

386
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
somehow get it into a csv because once

387
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
you have it in a csv

388
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
then you can do all kinds of stuff with

389
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
it every language can read it easily

390
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
there's all kinds of awesome tools that

391
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
can help you do you know all kinds of

392
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
analysis on it just as a csv

393
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
we have this great tool called csv kit

394
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
it allows you to do joins on csvs do all

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
kinds of stacking and filtering and all

396
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
kinds of stuff it's amazing

397
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
so a lot of the stuff i'm going to show

398
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
you is

399
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
ways to turn

400
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,000
human readable data into a file

401
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,959
oh

402
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,279
skipped a slide okay first problem uh

403
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
webs

404
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,079
that is

405
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,120
bots and browsing the web

406
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
um

407
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
usually

408
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
when you're scraping it's downloading

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
html right

410
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,040
but not always um

411
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
sometimes it's

412
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
uh you know interacting with the when

413
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
you get downloading some pdfs

414
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,560
doesn't really matter the point is that

415
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
is interacting our web browser

416
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
interacting with the website

417
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
um

418
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
web scraping used to be like a part of

419
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
my work

420
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
recently like governments especially in

421
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
the local area have like becoming

422
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,240
they're becoming more technical savvy so

423
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,519
it's easier to get like an excel

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
spreadsheet from them but five ten years

425
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
ago that was not the case i scraped

426
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
everything so one of my largest scrapes

427
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,240
was i scraped the entire entire seattle

428
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
municipal core

429
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
database so i had like

430
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
nearly every misdemeanor going back to

431
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
the 1970s

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
it's really important

433
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
for us to be able to use a real browser

434
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,519
because most of the sites that we're

435
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,720
trying to scrape use a lot of javascript

436
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
uh like really old sites

437
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
using like old asp and dotnet stuff

438
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,279
just really you have to have a browser

439
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,079
so

440
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,160
that means that we're doing a lot of

441
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
selenium um

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
yeah

443
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,839
um okay so reason why webscript

444
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,800
there's a lot of ways to do one thing

445
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,199
these are the search buttons from all of

446
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,600
the canadian

447
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,399
search pages so for each province you

448
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
have like a way to search lobbyists to

449
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
see you know

450
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,839
lobbying for what um what companies are

451
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,959
paying basically you that all the

452
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,519
information is online each product

453
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
database and these are the search

454
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
buttons from each

455
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,480
um

456
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
code you can see the code from each too

457
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
the code is not always the same this

458
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
search button um it's you know it's it's

459
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
an high tag italic thing um

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
and it's in a button which is good but

461
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
anchor tag with an image

462
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
so your scraper needs to be able to

463
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
figure out how to submit you know how to

464
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
do a search

465
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
in a generic way is hard

466
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,160
so

467
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
right now there's not really any tools

468
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,919
out there that can be like hey

469
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,559
find a scraper at a site and

470
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,760
hit submit

471
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,119
hit hit

472
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,480
the search button you know even if we

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,400
just want a search button um that

474
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,799
doesn't exist

475
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,679
and that would be useful

476
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,600
okay so yeah scraping is hard because

477
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,240
you have to handle unexpected things

478
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
this site here

479
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
under certain conditions

480
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
will give you a search result but under

481
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
other conditions it'll give you an

482
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,640
old-school javascript alert box and you

483
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
have to click ok you got to make that go

484
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,720
away so if your scraper didn't know that

485
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
that was going to happen your scraper

486
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
would break so

487
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
having a robust web scraper tool is

488
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,240
it's really hard to build

489
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,320
just because you have to like know all

490
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
the different things that are going to

491
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,080
happen or have thought of oh alert what

492
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
if an alert pops up okay let's just put

493
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
some code in there hit a submit and then

494
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
if there's an alert click that um all

495
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
these things need

496
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
so if there was some kind of like you

497
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,720
know scraper library that did this it

498
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
would be super useful

499
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
okay

500
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
and here's the seattle municipal

501
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,120
quartzite

502
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,400
the load times on this are an issue

503
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,919
because they vary

504
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,360
you got to wait for that little scroll

505
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,640
thing to go away

506
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
and

507
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
like

508
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,679
knowing how to code for that is hard um

509
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
if if your scraper like hit submit and

510
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
then it looks through the page

511
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,400
immediately there's a chance the

512
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
document won't be loaded yet maybe that

513
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
little scroller didn't even load yet so

514
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
it's like

515
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,679
being able to figure out page

516
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
transitions that's super hard because

517
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
every page is different

518
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,559
um this is using like some old school

519
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
javascript stuff

520
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,679
sometimes this site just

521
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,840
really lags and takes like five minutes

522
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,480
to load a page sometimes it's super fast

523
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,440
um

524
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
you need to be able to all those

525
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
scenarios

526
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
um

527
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,880
yeah

528
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
and you know similarly when i was

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,919
looking through

530
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,640
the

531
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,760
the province lobbyist searches um one of

532
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
them's down so scraper needs to know

533
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,720
what to do when when the site's down um

534
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
or you know your script can just explode

535
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,440
but

536
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
if you're only scraping something once a

537
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
day and this happens like maybe you want

538
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
to wait i don't know

539
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,799
it would be useful if there was some

540
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,039
kind of like you know

541
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
library that helped these kind of things

542
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
okay so the existing

543
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
web scraping this is you know there's

544
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,039
there's something called uh scrapey

545
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,799
scrapey's cool

546
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
uh but you gotta write a lot of code

547
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
there's a lot of boilerplate um the more

548
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,679
code you write the more code you have to

549
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,880
maintain

550
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,280
and scrapers are super brittle often

551
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
they break a lot

552
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
and you know the more code there is the

553
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
more annoying it's going to be to

554
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
maintain

555
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
so writing less code is always best um

556
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
css selectors xpath that's like how most

557
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
like web scraping tutorials would tell

558
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
you to do things

559
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
like i said before super brittle um

560
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,919
susceptible to like small changes in the

561
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
page layout or like the design or

562
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
whatever the function of the page might

563
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
not change but you know maybe to change

564
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,240
the ids maybe the ids are automatically

565
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
generated the classes and ids that's how

566
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,039
facebook works um if your scraper relies

567
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,120
on the classes being the same

568
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
it's only going to work for a small

569
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,760
period of time

570
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,799
so

571
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
we need things that can be robust

572
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
um selenium talked about this but you

573
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
know working with selenium is super

574
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
tedious for both

575
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,480
you gotta catch every possible

576
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
issue

577
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
it's just super hard

578
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,840
and the reason i think it's hard is

579
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
because we're really lacking domain

580
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,120
specific languages around web scraping

581
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
we have one called hex for extracting

582
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
data from html and this is kind of cool

583
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
this is a hex template

584
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
so this is saying

585
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
for all anchor tags

586
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,320
um extract the href

587
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
as the link and the text of the tag as

588
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
title and then if we have some input

589
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
html we would get this um json back

590
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
so that's like a really cool idea

591
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,919
a domain specific language we're

592
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
extracting data from html i use this a

593
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
lot be awesome if there was something

594
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,120
similar for uh for web scraping

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
and there's i mean there's so many

596
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,120
things that we could do with web

597
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
scraping um

598
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
it's just a huge vest area

599
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,039
all right the next problem is pdf data

600
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,039
extraction pdfs are everywhere if you

601
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,640
request data from a clerk you're gonna

602
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
get a pdf like nine times out of ten

603
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,880
what a pdf

604
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
is is like an unstructured unstructured

605
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,159
view into some structured data

606
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
they're often not ocr'd

607
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
or they are poorly ocr'd

608
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,679
um clerks in a lot of places especially

609
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,360
like police departments they love doing

610
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
a print to a pdf for an excel

611
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
spreadsheet let's say that they do this

612
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
you can't change it but like if i was

613
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
going to change it i could do that

614
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
anyways

615
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,520
but you're good yeah so if you're a

616
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,400
journalist you're going to be working

617
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
with a lot of pdfs

618
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
uh we do have some tools to extract this

619
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,840
stuff um they're not perfect

620
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,880
um

621
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
yeah so here's like just an example pdf

622
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,600
this comes from this project called pdf

623
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,240
plumber written by a journalist i know

624
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,799
pdf is the portable document

625
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,559
what a pdf is

626
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,840
is it is releasing on displaying

627
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
information

628
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,360
on all the same way so you can guarantee

629
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
that if you have this pdf it's going to

630
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,600
look the same on all computers and that

631
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,320
was like kind of a revolutionary idea

632
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
you know a long time ago because you

633
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
know you're you're sending text files

634
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
around it depends on the font that the

635
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,400
person has depends on the font size that

636
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,679
the person has

637
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
this was like the best technology for

638
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
ensuring that a document looks the same

639
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,840
across you know a bunch of environments

640
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
um

641
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
yeah so

642
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
this is like a really good spreadsheet

643
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,480
because this one is ocr and you can't

644
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
see that but it has like these little

645
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
lines it's really cool nothing's cut off

646
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,720
this is like an ideal spreadsheet

647
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,640
um here's what a spreadsheet looks like

648
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
that same spreadsheet looks like

649
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
i've taken the raw data from the pdf and

650
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
turned it into a spreadsheet

651
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,640
and you can see

652
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,799
um this one this says notice date here

653
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,480
we have not i see notice date so each

654
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
thing on a pdf

655
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
each letter each line

656
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,600
it's

657
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,279
has a location

658
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,760
where it is what it looks like um all

659
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,879
that so it's like

660
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,279
there's no such thing as like a word

661
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,720
there's no sentence there's nothing

662
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
there's just individual characters

663
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,919
scattered all over on the page that's

664
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,919
what a pdf is

665
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,600
and that's why it's so hard to extract

666
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,520
data from it

667
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,720
um

668
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
yeah so here's another example this is

669
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,279
like a more realistic example of a pdf

670
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,279
you'll see this is from vancouver

671
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
vancouver police department this is

672
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
their use of force records so if they

673
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
use force against someone there's a log

674
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,559
of it this is that log this is just one

675
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,720
page of it this is like you know

676
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,240
obviously an excel spreadsheet of some

677
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,799
kind and they printed it to a pdf for me

678
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
um you know there's some problems here

679
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,159
it's cut off

680
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
um you know the the names are kind of

681
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
split up all weird

682
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,559
um this one here just

683
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
you know it's not even on the same line

684
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,919
anymore that's a problem

685
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,039
um

686
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,039
but this is still considered like a

687
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,760
really high quality pdf in terms of like

688
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
extraction um needs

689
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,440
we have a cool tool called tabula

690
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,400
um it can extract it can turn a pdf into

691
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
a csv file

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
it's awesome but it either works or it

693
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,360
doesn't

694
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,279
um

695
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,440
using this like all of us data

696
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
journalists like this is a right of

697
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
passage pretty much writing something

698
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
that works with tabula

699
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
um yeah if you look at the contributors

700
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,559
of this

701
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,400
um this project

702
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,159
most of the people

703
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
are like really highly skilled data

704
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
journalists

705
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
uh where it doesn't work is like right

706
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,799
here

707
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,880
so this this pdf this is another use of

708
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,480
force

709
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
oh sorry this is a complaints log from

710
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,520
police near me um you can highlight the

711
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,679
text here but if you do that highlight

712
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
it and you paste it you get this and

713
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,000
it's like not and you know it's not in

714
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
like a useful order so just because the

715
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
document is ocr it doesn't mean that

716
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
it's like

717
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,559
gonna be easier to extract it

718
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,039
necessarily um

719
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
we need a way to like be like okay i

720
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
need all of these blocks

721
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,679
column you know and something like some

722
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
kind of a structure to do this

723
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
it just doesn't exist um so what we do

724
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
as journalists we were

725
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,159
writing i have a one-off script that can

726
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,000
handle exact pdf

727
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,879
okay

728
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,279
all right so

729
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,960
more reasons why you

730
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,080
help extract data from pdfs um here's a

731
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,760
historic climate data record um this is

732
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,279
like some two data

733
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
um this is what it looks like it's got

734
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
this brown background that

735
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
has these weird symbols that's gonna

736
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
make it hard to extract but climate

737
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,080
science

738
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,880
information so by

739
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,480
writing tools that can do this you would

740
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
not just be helping journalists

741
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,520
climate science

742
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
and just here's another example of a

743
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
similar

744
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,720
format

745
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
um okay the next problem we run into is

746
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
ocr optical character recognition and

747
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,360
that is turning printed letters into

748
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
computerized text

749
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,240
this is like a fun little portable ocr

750
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
tool

751
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:22,960
um

752
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
and yeah

753
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,039
so

754
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,159
this

755
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,880
kind of shows here but it's often not

756
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,279
perfect we can see that yeah

757
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,960
oh there's a lot of problems a lot of

758
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
typos but it's pretty close you know we

759
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,919
got a little we got a squiggly brace

760
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
instead of a parenthesis

761
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
um why is ocr important have you ever

762
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,880
heard of the panama papers um

763
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
uh this was like one of the first like

764
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,799
huge ocr heavy and huge just data

765
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
journalism projects um there was really

766
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,520
good talk about this and a hope in the

767
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
recent past

768
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
um

769
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,120
long story short um an employee from the

770
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,919
panamanian um law firm

771
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,880
fonseca leaked data this is like the

772
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,159
chat log that they had with the

773
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,480
journalists

774
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,120
this law firm managed the money of some

775
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
very powerful organizations and very

776
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,039
very wealthy people

777
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,320
so this is like super rich

778
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,799
really important is being able to get

779
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,399
people places

780
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,399
from the data

781
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,000
um

782
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,960
yeah so being able to link and trace

783
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
people through this data um

784
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,520
yeah so

785
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
it was leaked to

786
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
deutsche zeitung uh the south german

787
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
newspaper or sc

788
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
it came in over time so eventually it

789
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,720
was 2.6 terabytes of data 11.5 million

790
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,080
files

791
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,760
and then here's kind of the breakdown of

792
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,919
all the types of files so there's emails

793
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,279
database entries pdfs a lot of pdfs and

794
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,960
images

795
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,840
so this is all places where ocr would

796
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,720
come and helpful come in handy

797
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
i talked to one of the journalists who

798
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
worked on this project they used a tool

799
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
called new x which is something that

800
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
like police and like homicide

801
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
investigators and you know

802
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
those kinds of higher level law

803
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
enforcement agencies use to um go

804
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,480
through like evidence logs and stuff it

805
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
allows people to search it does like

806
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,039
some rough um entity extraction so it'll

807
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,600
like identify people's names and like

808
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,880
places and

809
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
the names of things

810
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,320
um proper nouns you know that kind of

811
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
stuff and allow you to search them and

812
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
be like okay give me all the

813
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,720
give me all the documents um talking

814
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,960
about the queen or something like that

815
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,240
um you can do that with nuix it has

816
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,720
a poor ocr engine

817
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
so if there was any kind of

818
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
a problem with the scan of the of the

819
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,919
document you know some dirt on the xerox

820
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,240
copier or whatever um

821
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,159
maybe the person's name you know got

822
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,520
messed up a little bit and now they're

823
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
not going to be in the search results

824
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
because no one's going to read 11.5

825
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,000
million files to find it

826
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
i talked to him i said i was like hey

827
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
what if someone um developed a better

828
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,080
ocr engine for new x would you

829
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,600
re-re-run all the data and he said he's

830
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,039
like yeah we would definitely redo it

831
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,039
we'd probably get like you know a lot

832
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,720
more leads out of it

833
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,799
um so like being able to do better ocr

834
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
would have real world impact

835
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,080
so

836
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,559
this here is a file that i requested

837
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
from a police department this is a

838
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,120
complaint log against police officers

839
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
and it's in handwriting this is how they

840
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
keep track of complaints against police

841
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,480
officers

842
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,159
um

843
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
i i'm involved in a project where i'm

844
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,320
like investigating police misconduct in

845
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
my area and you know here we go

846
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,799
favoritism striptease dance enticing

847
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
female inmates who expose their breasts

848
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
just handwritten record um if i hadn't

849
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,679
just stumbled across this

850
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,960
probably no one would ever know about

851
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
this

852
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,159
um and there's really no good tools

853
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,200
um to do this kind of stuff uh there's

854
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
you know there's research papers there's

855
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,080
machine learning techniques that

856
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
supposedly can do really good on

857
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
handwriting but

858
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,159
you know there's no easy to use tools um

859
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,760
something like this would be just so

860
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,760
helpful

861
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,120
okay the next problem here is form data

862
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,799
extraction this is kind of similar to

863
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
pdf

864
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,519
here we have romney for president um

865
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
placing an ad on first coast news first

866
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,640
for you i don't know this this is a tv

867
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
station so 150

868
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,679
dollars we're going to run some airtime

869
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
ads between

870
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,480
july 30th to august 7th 2012. so

871
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,279
um being extracted data from this it's

872
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,480
not like in the pdf spreadsheet example

873
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,799
where everything's in nice rows you know

874
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,279
this data is um the fields for this data

875
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,840
they're scattered all over the page

876
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,240
so being able to turn a form into like a

877
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,200
row in a spreadsheet would be very very

878
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
useful um

879
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,960
what this is is the government does

880
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,399
require

881
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,080
political action committees and other

882
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,799
political actors to file

883
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,799
you know documents

884
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,039
i'm saying that they've purchased ads um

885
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,240
the agency sorry the um the broadcasters

886
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,279
file these but there's no standard form

887
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,240
so here's two different forms from

888
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,840
different

889
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,080
different media organizations

890
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
and

891
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
you know they have similar information

892
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
they look pretty similar but they are

893
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,360
slightly different

894
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,240
here's another example you know this one

895
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
is completely different and this one's

896
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,320
you know more similar to the others but

897
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,200
again different

898
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,200
um

899
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,399
yeah so

900
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,000
this problem is huge you see this

901
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,919
everywhere a lot of campaign finance

902
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,360
data has stuff like this um

903
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
often a pdf is sometimes just images

904
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
i describe them as like visually

905
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,240
structured so like you know there's

906
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,399
lines there's kind of loose structure

907
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,640
and it's organized like in a block kind

908
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,600
of visually um

909
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
propublica did a huge project a

910
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,159
crowdsource project to um free the files

911
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,200
as they say

912
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,559
they uh

913
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,159
built a web tool where you could go in

914
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,760
you could pull up one of these and then

915
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,960
you could

916
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,440
annotate one you can like oh this is a

917
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
product field this is

918
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
the amount right here the rate um you

919
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
could do that so what they were trying

920
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,880
to do is have people

921
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,559
call these

922
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,600
and then

923
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
the hope was that they would build a

924
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
machine learning tool or you know some

925
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,840
algorithm that would be able to look at

926
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
this specific form like this kind of

927
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
form and pull out all the fields they

928
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
need

929
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,080
um

930
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
it worked pretty good but it's

931
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
it's nowhere near perfect and this is a

932
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
problem that a lot of um people active

933
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
in journalism machine learning research

934
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,440
this is like one of their good data sets

935
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
that we

936
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,760
models and stuff

937
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,840
um

938
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,040
so

939
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,719
together yeah

940
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
all the techniques that i listed

941
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,759
extracting data from pdfs scraping

942
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,719
one investigation will typically use all

943
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,480
of them

944
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
so this is

945
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,079
panel my papers um there's a lot of

946
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
really good information

947
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,679
investigation if you're interested you

948
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,480
can search for it

949
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,679
yeah they they had to turn pdfs and this

950
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
raw data into something something

951
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,839
unreadable because like i said before it

952
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,520
was generated

953
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,639
but it needs to be machine readable so

954
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,679
they

955
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,280
are talking about how the compute

956
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,560
hardware

957
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,639
using the technology at the time used

958
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,879
more than 30

959
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,679
um and it took them two months the first

960
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
data is ready for reporters to even

961
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,160
start to analyze

962
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,240
there's a really good talk about this um

963
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,400
one of the reporters was saying like

964
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
describing how they had to constantly up

965
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
their servers

966
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,599
um

967
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,440
uh this was at a point of doing the

968
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,760
cloud but when they found data

969
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
they had to keep it in a room and make

970
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
sure that nobody else had access to

971
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,599
control access to it so they couldn't

972
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,760
just put it on amazon

973
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
because they didn't want the government

974
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,400
to seize it or someone just sees it

975
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
because it was stolen property

976
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,760
so

977
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,480
yeah scaling up this one server you know

978
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
using the technology at the time took a

979
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,640
long time so tools to make this easier

980
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
to make this faster um it would just be

981
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,320
so helpful

982
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,720
and would really just unlock a lot of

983
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
investigations that aren't really

984
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
possible right now

985
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,720
okay and

986
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,119
why do all this the point of doing all

987
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
these things scraping extracting is to

988
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,119
build data sets

989
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,280
data sets are like the bread and butter

990
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,599
of data journalism

991
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,480
and um we need to build our own data

992
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
sets because most of the questions that

993
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
we're interested in there's no data set

994
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,280
for that

995
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
um if you want to know

996
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,280
like i don't know like a lot of climate

997
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,960
stuff hey pipelines across the country

998
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
how many abandoned pipelines are there

999
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,480
in the us

1000
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,640
the answer is there's a lot because you

1001
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,160
know we've been mining in this country

1002
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,680
for a long time um and drilling um and

1003
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
there's no

1004
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,880
one nationwide data set describing that

1005
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,760
same thing with police misconduct

1006
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,520
newsrooms across across the country are

1007
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,119
building their own data sets trying to

1008
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
answer the question of you know what

1009
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,839
happens to bad cops

1010
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,359
what causes police to be fired

1011
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,000
how many use of force events are there

1012
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
does my seat have more than other states

1013
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,680
these are not questions that you can

1014
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
answer right now

1015
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,680
because there's no data set for it

1016
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
so

1017
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
if you want to help journalists the

1018
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
single most helpful thing you could do

1019
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,200
would be to build a data set

1020
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,079
um

1021
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,760
but that's not easy you know that's hard

1022
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
that's a long haul that requires

1023
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
dedication

1024
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,920
but it can have huge impact

1025
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,440
i have this example here this is the

1026
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
california reporting project started in

1027
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,560
2018

1028
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,839
they

1029
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,280
gathered

1030
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
basically like anytime an officer got in

1031
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,320
trouble they got that record they

1032
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
requested that record and they tried to

1033
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
request it from

1034
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,520
as many police departments across the

1035
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
entire state as they could and that was

1036
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,720
like a uh

1037
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,359
a team of 50 newsrooms across the whole

1038
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
state and

1039
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
they were using very low

1040
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,040
low technology methods to do that

1041
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
so if you had you know some technology

1042
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,119
some scraping some requesting

1043
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
ways to automate records requests and

1044
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,359
manage those and pull in the data you

1045
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,599
could do really great work

1046
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,200
um and you could do it on any subject

1047
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
you're interested you know i just talked

1048
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
about client because that's a big one

1049
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
but you know anything related to

1050
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
criminal justice

1051
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
would be huge campaign finance there's

1052
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,079
campaign finance um data like all over

1053
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,880
but bringing it all together um in you

1054
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
know specific way always helpful

1055
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,560
um advertising information you know um

1056
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,400
google facebook

1057
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
these companies are not transparent

1058
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,720
about advertising

1059
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,160
um you know

1060
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,560
you can help build a data set about that

1061
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,359
um and you know

1062
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,720
these things would

1063
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,400
just be so important so so useful

1064
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,960
um okay so i'm going back to like the

1065
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,920
science process of data journalism um

1066
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
this is the data set building process

1067
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,599
you're gonna prepare so you're gonna do

1068
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,520
some research you're gonna figure out

1069
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,800
who or how to get the data you need

1070
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,760
who you have who do you have to ask

1071
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,359
where do you find it

1072
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,200
things like this

1073
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,680
you want to do this in like a

1074
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
repeatable

1075
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
and

1076
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,800
reproducible way

1077
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
so that if you need to gather more data

1078
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,599
later on you can do it in the same way

1079
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,640
so yeah you just really want to be

1080
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,560
systematic and you know what you put in

1081
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,160
in the beginning in the preparation

1082
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,119
phase i'll just pay dividends later on

1083
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,720
the gathering phase you know that's

1084
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
where these tools come in you know

1085
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,920
extracting

1086
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,800
forms getting stuff out of pdfs

1087
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,200
gathering you know scraping tools this

1088
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,800
is a very tool based part of the process

1089
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,640
and then once you have it you also need

1090
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,240
to process the data that's where more

1091
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
tools come in

1092
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,160
these two parts of the process very tool

1093
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
heavy and this is the area where

1094
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,680
journalists need help

1095
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
right now the the machine learning tools

1096
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,240
that we have

1097
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,720
though oriented towards the needs of big

1098
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,520
tech

1099
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
so you know recommenders yeah if you

1100
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,640
need a recommender there's so much

1101
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
technology available for you if you need

1102
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,720
to analyze handwriting from a

1103
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,800
handwritten police report you're out of

1104
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,720
luck because google and facebook aren't

1105
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
going to make money off that so there's

1106
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,280
just not as much research into that area

1107
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
so yeah once you've gathered and

1108
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,359
processed the data

1109
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,839
analyzing it that's your next step you

1110
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,560
need to turn your data into a story you

1111
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
know computers understand data

1112
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,800
humans understand narratives um and you

1113
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
know cause and effect that's that's what

1114
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,720
humans understand

1115
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,960
um and that's not always easy for for

1116
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
technical people

1117
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,560
um so once you have the data like i said

1118
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
the data is not the story you can share

1119
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
the data but that's not a story

1120
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,800
um you need to know your data

1121
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,599
read read read so you know you've done

1122
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,040
all this work you've built this amazing

1123
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,440
data set you need to understand it now

1124
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,800
you have a good idea of where it came

1125
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
from and how it was built so you might

1126
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,640
know the pitfalls of it and what it's

1127
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
not what it doesn't contain but you

1128
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,440
really do need to read it to understand

1129
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
what it is what it is you've collected

1130
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
gathered

1131
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
um

1132
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,640
to go beyond the the data phase

1133
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
and start publishing i recommend that

1134
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,119
you partner with a local news

1135
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,440
organization

1136
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,359
that's going to be your best bet they

1137
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,280
don't have the resources or the know how

1138
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
to build data sets to do

1139
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
these advanced scrapes to build these

1140
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,079
tools to extract stuff out of pdfs

1141
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,000
chances are they don't know how but they

1142
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,560
do know how to build stories

1143
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
they do know the context of the thing

1144
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,400
that you have most likely

1145
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,880
they do know like what kinds of things

1146
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,960
are important politically in your area

1147
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
that you know would have ramifications

1148
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,760
for your data

1149
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
so it's potentially a very mutually

1150
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,560
beneficial um

1151
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,160
partnership

1152
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,440
you can also reach out to academics

1153
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,280
academics are kind of in a similar boat

1154
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,720
you know

1155
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
can always use help on with technical

1156
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
type things and obviously a combination

1157
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,760
of the of the the two academics and um

1158
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,200
reporters

1159
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,880
that's even better

1160
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,200
i helped with a story

1161
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,280
propublica and the palm beach post did

1162
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,440
something called black snow

1163
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,240
it was about sugarcane burning so in

1164
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,079
florida they allow

1165
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,960
sugar cane farmers to burn their crops

1166
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,680
and they do it in an area only on

1167
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,359
certain days when the wind's not blowing

1168
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,800
it's blowing towards like where rich

1169
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,440
people live basically and the whole

1170
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
industry was just saying well

1171
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,400
uh it's fine it's not toxic even though

1172
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
there's black smoke and people get

1173
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
hospitalized they're like no no that's

1174
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,359
unrelated um

1175
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,520
we have it tested we're fine there's no

1176
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,000
problems here um

1177
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
local people didn't believe it

1178
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,520
scientists didn't believe that so they

1179
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,000
actually partnered with academics you

1180
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,640
know pollution like um air

1181
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
air scientists whatever

1182
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,720
and they put out sensors and you know

1183
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,640
they did the science that the epa wasn't

1184
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,480
doing um

1185
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,079
yeah so that's a case where partnerships

1186
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,319
news and academia

1187
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,760
could be very very fruitful

1188
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,920
yeah

1189
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,079
something i like to tell people is like

1190
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,599
if you're interested in news and

1191
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,000
reporting and investigative stuff

1192
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,760
there's a place for you in the industry

1193
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
there really is

1194
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,440
it can take a while to get involved but

1195
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,400
the journalism scene is changing um

1196
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,040
collaboration and cooperation amongst

1197
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,680
people is um becoming increasingly

1198
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
embraced

1199
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,160
um

1200
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,640
yeah in local local local like

1201
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
if you're gonna reach out to someone

1202
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
find your local newsroom

1203
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,680
it might be small you know a lot of

1204
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,640
local newsrooms are only like two people

1205
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,040
three people i live in the the capital

1206
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,079
of my state and the local newspaper here

1207
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,480
is three reporters that's it

1208
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,280
so

1209
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
local news is shrinking and it needs

1210
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,880
your help

1211
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,079
um and like i said collaboration um you

1212
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,520
know

1213
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
it just you do so such good work when

1214
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
you collaborate so the more people that

1215
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,119
you can um you can talk to the better

1216
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,800
if you are building a data set about

1217
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
something find someone who covers

1218
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,599
what you are like interested in you know

1219
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,040
find if you're looking into criminal

1220
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,160
justice type stuff find a a police beat

1221
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,880
reporter um figure out who covers the

1222
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
thing that you want to work on and talk

1223
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,319
to them because that's going to be your

1224
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,760
best bet

1225
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,960
um

1226
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,520
a budget might be a problem though news

1227
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,800
you know they only have a few people

1228
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,319
working they probably don't have a huge

1229
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,400
budget so they might not be able to pay

1230
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,160
you very much

1231
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,839
that's just one of the sad realities of

1232
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,839
the industry right now

1233
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,440
there's just not a lot of money in it

1234
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,160
especially smaller smaller organizations

1235
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,200
like a lot of them don't have a

1236
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,680
freelance budget

1237
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,560
so

1238
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,280
what i do find is like if you work with

1239
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,920
them they will try to do their best to

1240
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,440
compensate you

1241
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,520
um but you know you can't do it for the

1242
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,359
money for the most part

1243
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,079
um conned potential kinds of

1244
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,680
you know working with other newsrooms is

1245
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,400
uh they might ask for exclusivity you

1246
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,560
know they might want to say hey um can

1247
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,800
we not share this with anyone until we

1248
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,400
publish our first report

1249
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,079
that's gonna be half that's gonna um be

1250
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,359
something that you're gonna have to like

1251
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,560
really consider and say is that i'm am i

1252
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,920
okay with that

1253
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,200
um

1254
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
and

1255
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,680
that's you know it's always a trade-off

1256
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,319
because people want to release data now

1257
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,480
but by holding on to it and working it

1258
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,000
as long as you are actually going to

1259
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,640
share it you could increase the impact

1260
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,640
that you could have by you know kind of

1261
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
carefully crafting your story and doing

1262
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,119
a thorough investigation rather than

1263
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,560
just gathering some data and just

1264
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,800
spitting it out there which

1265
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
you could put a lot of work into it and

1266
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
that can have very little effect because

1267
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,599
uh you know the signal-to-noise ratio

1268
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,280
there's a lot of noise out there it's

1269
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,280
hard to find the signal so your your

1270
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,680
data could get lost

1271
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
the other thing is bias

1272
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,119
really really um try you have to try to

1273
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,480
not be biased not appear biased

1274
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,119
if you are scraping police sites and

1275
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
somehow getting let's just say use of

1276
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,319
force data and you've built this huge

1277
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,800
database if your twitter feed is

1278
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
cops cops spell the whole time no

1279
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,640
one's gonna want to work with you

1280
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
because they're not gonna necessarily

1281
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,079
know that they can trust you

1282
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:20,880
um

1283
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,040
i don't believe that impartiality is

1284
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,440
like you know a real thing like everyone

1285
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,040
brings their own bias to whatever they

1286
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,720
work on but

1287
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,599
trying to um you know trying to like

1288
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,560
really try to be as neutral as possible

1289
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,040
goes a long way and particularly stuff

1290
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,839
about that affects you personally

1291
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,000
when i was working at a newspaper in

1292
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,119
texas

1293
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,720
i would have people all the time come up

1294
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,240
to me and be like hey

1295
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
i got this story i gathered all these

1296
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,079
documents they're going to build this

1297
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,160
bridge in my neighborhood and it's going

1298
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,079
to allow poor people to come over here

1299
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,680
and here's all the reasons why it's

1300
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,440
 up but none of the reasons were

1301
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
the real reason that you knew they

1302
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
didn't want it so it's

1303
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,240
things that affect people very

1304
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,640
personally um it's just hard not to be

1305
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,400
you know biased in your own favor

1306
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,200
so uh just be mindful of these um

1307
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,880
pitfalls

1308
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
okay and then resources if you want to

1309
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,520
get involved in data journalism um these

1310
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,640
are resources that you can reach out to

1311
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,960
look into nycar and ire ire is the

1312

doing journalism with computers which is

1321
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,960
not something everyone does um but

1322
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,839
there's an amazing conference

1323
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,839

small news

1346
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,720
you might be able to

1347
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,440
hook up with um

1348
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,880
through them

1349
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,760
um the iwl society

1350
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,680
cool organization they have trainings

1351
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,839
and stuff um

1352
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,240
around kind of like

1353
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,559
um helping non-representative people

1354
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,040
kind of journalism

1355
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,119
and then city bureau

1356
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,960
a really cool example

1357
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
of what can be done

1358
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,880
they hired like just average people

1359
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,520
like go and sit in on council meetings

1360
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,640
and my meetings at the school um

1361
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,599
just training people to get in their

1362
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,480
local

1363
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,240
um their local

1364
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,319
basically and they have like a subgroup

1365
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,920
called city scrapers

1366
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,599
you let people scrape data from their

1367
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,559
local governments and and gather it

1368
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,880
um so yeah these are resources that

1369
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
you should look if you're interested in

1370
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,720

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,480
want to try to find

1374
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,759

1380
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,839
if you think you have an awesome tool

1381
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,920
that journalists will need

1382
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
to me

1383
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,440
i would love to chat with you all

1384
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,599
and that's what i got for slides

1385
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,599
so if any questions i would take mine

1386
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,440
all right we have time for just a couple

1387
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,839
we've got like two minutes for q a so we

1388
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,359
have one live q a question here

1389
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,040
how much time do you spend scraping

1390
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,400
social media

1391
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,079
sites looking for

1392
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,280
data about individuals

1393
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,160
uh data on individuals i don't do at all

1394
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,680
data on what youtube recommends me

1395
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,160
well actors are advertising on facebook

1396
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,119
um i don't do that very much now but

1397
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,200
that sometimes when i'm especially when

1398
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,440
i'm doing research into like

1399
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,280
and stuff i want to see what they are

1400
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,839
paying people to see

1401
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,839
like that and a related question how

1402
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:54,720
much

1403
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,640
uh effort do you spend looking at the

1404
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,000
wayback machine

1405
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,599
i work at the internet archive so in

1406
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,960
particular oh

1407
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,240
i love the pain uh i use it like every

1408
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,880
day probably

1409
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,400
yeah

1410
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
all right one more question from a

1411
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,520
speaker here in the audience and i think

1412
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,319
we're going to be a time okay so um i'm

1413
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,400
an editor with ieee spectrum so it's

1414
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,920
great to see you looking at these tools

1415
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,599
instead of us one thing i would also

1416
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,880
make an appeal for is maybe a a regex

1417
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
helper so these are data sets as you

1418
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,160
know they're we can't use machine

1419
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
learning on them they're not really that

1420
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,119
big enough but something if i'm

1421
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,640
searching for say let's say scheme

1422
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,640
programmers job listings for scheme

1423
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,000
programmers just

1424
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,760
and then i don't want to pick up ads

1425
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,839
that are pension scheme but i don't want

1426
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,680
to have this i want a scheme programmer

1427
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,920
i'm offering you a pension scheme so

1428
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,400
tools that would help people build regex

1429
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,240
and also journalists i think trust regex

1430
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,359
more because they feel more

1431
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,000
deterministic than than ml so i would

1432
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,319
just add that to your pile of wish wish

1433
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,520
lists

1434
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,440
right yeah i think that's a great one um

1435
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,240
regex you know super um

1436
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,680
use it way more than machine learning

1437
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,200
because

1438
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,880
it's understandable you can explain it

1439
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
to people and you know how it's going to

1440
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,319
work every time

1441
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,520
