6
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
all right welcome everyone to our four

7
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
o'clock session

8
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,960
just want to remind everyone put your

9
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
phones on stun or vibrate

10
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
um stay hydrated it's hydrated it's hot

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
today and i know there's no bottled

12
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
water so there's water fountains around

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
the corner there

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
again if you have any issues medical or

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
otherwise look for someone with a radio

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
or a

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
a staff shirt

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
so i have the pleasure of introducing

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,240
julia corona and alessandro podoro

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
and they had the most creative title of

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
i think that this the whole day today

22
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,439
um

23
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
porn flap porn platforms hate them for

24
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
exposing their mischief with these two

25
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,758
weird tricks welcome

26
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,800
hello everyone hello

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
thank you we are alessandra and julia

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
alessandro is a lawyer i'm a

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
communication designer and data analyst

30
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
and we are part of this european

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
organization called tracking exposed

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
who does

33
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,920
algorithmic auditing

34
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,440
algorithm accountability and focus on

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
digital rights

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,920
uh in this talk we will present you our

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
research on pornhub

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
and

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,800
we also investigate tiktok and youtube

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
currently

41
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
uh so check it out at

42
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,879
tracking.expose

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
what we do

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
basically we um

45
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
we analyze platforms

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
uh not people

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,360
we want to collect data to understand

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
the property algorithms uh for public

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
interest

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
in this example

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
we use the

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
pronoun tracking expose

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
browser extension

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
and

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
the idea is that

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
platforms can conceptualize

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
gender

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
and other social constructs

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
and can

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
verify

61
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
conceptions about it

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
and can shape

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
affect maintain

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
status quo and general

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
identities

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,760
so why porn and why pournam porn because

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
we can consider internet as a

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
pornographic technology

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,560
if we think about uh football

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,900
or

71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,400
[Music]

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
how they are made now to

73
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
let's say uh

74
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
get your attention visually and uh

75
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
stimulate your gaze

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
why for now for now because it's uh the

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
first and the biggest uh of the

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
pornographic platforms uh yet at the

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
moment

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
um

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,919
it is a platform because first

82
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,520
there is identification of the user

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
they have content and there is a

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
standardized

85
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
based on popularity and predictability

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
and they also have

87
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
targeted content and ads

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,400
third

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
they have this data porn so they use

90
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
their blog year in review

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,600
as a

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
communication strategy and

93
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
form of advertising because they claim

94
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
this is a transparency

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
tool but actually they decide what to

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,039
tell you and what data they can share

97
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,680
and what data they cannot

98
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
so

99
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,120
we know that algorithms are black boxes

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
and

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
there is

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
no knowledge about

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
how

104
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,800
fair and unbiased algorithm should look

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
like we don't even know if it is

106
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,919
possible

107
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
we know that

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
automated

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
surveillance

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
is something related with the

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
conservatives

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
but now

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
we give it for granted and we just think

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
that it's biased and there is a

115
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,160
universal truth but

116
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
we are not sure about it

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,530
and

118
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,759
[Music]

119
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
we

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
cannot think about a different uh word a

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
different

122
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,560
alternative to this system and to

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
surveillance capitalism

124
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
so what we do

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
we do scrappyism is web scraping but for

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
artistic emotional or critical answers

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,560
this is what sam lavina says so we find

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,080
ourselves in this

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,600
we have html websites and pages with

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
non-structured data all nested around

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,479
and we created this extension to extract

132
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
parse them and do scraping

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
then we have a structured json or csv

134
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,680
that we can analyze and compare

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
to also document what's happening with

136
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
the platform

137
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,280
our methodology for this paper was

138
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
actually considering

139
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
one sexual interest over the three

140
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
pernap allows us to have so we can be

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,759
interested in girls guys or girls and

142
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,319
guys but then we can

143
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
have different gender gender identities

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
this is all in the

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
registration process

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
so there are 10 general identities and

147
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,599
we had

148
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,360
we

149
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
decided to focus on 10 accounts

150
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,880
we got like 1 600 on pages and there

151
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
were like 46 videos per page but we

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
understood that unique videos were

153
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
far away less

154
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
118

155
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
for this study

156
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
how does it look like this is one video

157
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
one entry for one video on the page so

158
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,039
we have a different metadata

159
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
title author name author link and the

160
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,759
size whatever we focused on section name

161
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
because we wanted to analyze the home

162
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,199
page from a section point of view

163
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
because there were

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,199
there are different sections

165
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
as you may know

166
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,879
or not i don't know

167
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,240
now i will show you how personalization

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
can look like from um

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
from a visualization point of view and

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
the graphs were made with the open

171
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,879
source tool gefi so check it out and

172
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,080
this is how

173
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
content that is not personalized look

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,560
like it looks like

175
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
we have the 10

176
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
triangles here that are

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,599
our

178
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,840
our accounts we created

179
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
and the videos in the middle so shared

180
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,320
by everyone

181
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,599
and these were

182
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
this was the case for hot phone videos

183
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,320
in your country most viewed videos in

184
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
your country so a geographical

185
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
personalization

186
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
uh um our bots were all from the same

187
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
country so that's why you see it like

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,360
this and recently feature videos

189
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
uh as well

190
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
but what happens when you

191
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
give a look to another section like

192
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
recommended category for you there is

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
different

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
uh

195
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
and it can also not be present for

196
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
different gender identities so we just

197
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
got it

198
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
in six

199
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,399
accounts

200
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,839
and

201
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,560
we can start to see um

202
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,839
that there are

203
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,480
protoclusters

204
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
so um some accounts that share a lot of

205
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
videos and others that

206
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
uh don't

207
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
um

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
in the last and in

209
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
the individualizer

210
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,360
personalization

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,839
in the recommended for you category so

212
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
for you section sorry

213
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
we can see two different clusters and

214
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
they are really uh well defined so we

215
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
found found out that there was a

216
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
heteronormative

217
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
cluster so male and female together

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,880
um in a more standard

219
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
cluster because they were they were

220
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,160
sharing like a lot and then there was

221
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
another cluster but

222
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
always depending on on the

223
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
um

224
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
on the main one um

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
there is a

226
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,720
less

227
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,440
heteronormative but puts all together

228
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
and is the case of trans men non-binary

229
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
same-sex

230
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
couples so female so lesbian

231
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
and trans woman

232
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
the curious thing is that

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
in the gender normative

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
we had the

235
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
models channel and porn stars

236
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
but

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
in the other we

238
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
were not able to find channels and so

239
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
production companies there are

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
uh

241
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
for

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
property uh as well so this uh was a

243
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
little bit uh

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
tricky we don't we still don't know how

245
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,040
to

246
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
give a meaning to this

247
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,360
um

248
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
but basically our main argument is that

249
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
the platform

250
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
and the algorithmic suggestions were

251
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
fostering a heteronormative perspective

252
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
on sexual desire

253
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,519
and

254
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,360
they were typical of a

255
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
heterosexual white and demonic

256
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
masculinity

257
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,440
so what comes next to this um

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
we would like to raise awareness about

259
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
topics like the gdpr like we are doing

260
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
here i don't know uh all the algorithms

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
uh consent and especially desire

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
we would like to

263
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,320
hold more the platform accountable for

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
the lack of transparency

265
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
with the respect of the tracking so

266
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
we also decided to proceed in a

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
different way and

268
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
to give a better look at

269
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,240
cash and

270
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,279
cookies

271
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
and then we would like to do some more

272
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
color for

273
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,079
action through our tools

274
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
so the next step was actually to create

275
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,000
this

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
new software called guardoni

277
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,839
because

278
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,120
we

279
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
understood that gaining data from

280
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
volunteers is great to have an empirical

281
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
first

282
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,680
example of what's happening and some

283
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
anecdotal evidences

284
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,959
but then to prove them and to say okay

285
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,519
we saw them we need to have a

286
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,000
clean environment and

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
a sort of a clean setup

288
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
even a small browser history can buy us

289
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,880
everything

290
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,519
so what are we now looking for we are

291
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,279
looking for third-party trackers and

292
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
how they relate to recommended content

293
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,959
and basically okay porn and how it uh

294
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,360
how it works uh how the rabbit hole can

295
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
be

296
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
can

297
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
make people become more

298
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
sadistic or

299
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,680
stuff like that

300
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,480
so this tool is

301
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
is available on github and

302
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,440
you can find it

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,160
in the methodology

304
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
directory

305
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
what can it do for us so it's a

306
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,760
laboratory setup

307
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
it can help us installing the

308
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
the extension on a clean browser because

309
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,680
it's directly installed

310
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,870
initialize a new uh

311
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,600
[Music]

312
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
chromium in this case profile

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,560
a new user data directory

314
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,079
um it can automatically navigate through

315
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
the website and

316
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
and gain some tracking data and

317
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,560
screenshots

318
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
we can have a look at the

319
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
the code it's basically a node library

320
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,120
with javascript extensions

321
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
and

322
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,480
the apis are quite

323
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
simple you can

324
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
launch the browser

325
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,399
wait uh

326
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,920
go to

327
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
a precise url take a screenshot and then

328
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
close it this is a simple example but an

329
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
experiment uh

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,079
that we do can be

331
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
exactly looking

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
like this

333
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,120
the experiment is a set of comments

334
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,279
uh we create a json with a list of url

335
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,560
we want to

336
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,160
access and uh for how much time uh if we

337
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,639
want to screenshot it's all defined in a

338
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
json you can create it with a

339
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
gist on github

340
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
and

341
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
when you give it to the tuerdo ani

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
iguadoni automate automatically

343
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
navigates through this

344
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
comments and instructions

345
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
the other thing we are doing is to

346
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,320
collect

347
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
the cookies in the local storage local

348
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
storage is a cache again

349
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
on your browser

350
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,320
it is different from a web storage

351
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
of cookies because it's a permanent you

352
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
have to uh

353
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
the cookies don't expire

354
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,160
so um as you can see we we collect the

355
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
cookies but also

356
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
we are

357
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
creating a sort of white list of

358
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,240
the domain pronable.comcdn.com

359
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,639
so we know it's

360
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,360
it's their cookies and okay but then we

361
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
are also extracting the third party

362
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,519
trackers

363
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
and um

364
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,279
yeah parse the the domain

365
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,759
so we can know who is

366
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
behind this cookies because

367
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
in the porn industry

368
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
online there was a

369
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,399
bubble and

370
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,560
no one wanted to

371
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,480
advertise on on porn platforms so

372
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
basically there is

373
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,639
a different uh

374
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
a different

375
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,320
market and a parallel ecosystem

376
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
of third-party service providers and

377
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
we would like to know more because it

378
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,360
has not been scrutinized yet but by

379
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
regulators or

380
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
[Music]

381
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,759
research community academics and policy

382
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,800
and

383
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
now alessandro will

384
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
talk to you more about the legal

385
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
perspective perspective

386
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,040
thank you thank you

387
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,900
[Applause]

388
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,919
sorry

389
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,520
okay can you

390
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
hear me all right

391
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,640
so yeah uh hello thank you for being

392
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,079
here thank you julia for the

393
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
presentation of our tools and the

394
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
research we have done with attracting

395
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,760
expos in the past years

396
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,000
so yeah

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,559
basically

398
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,000
my role here

399
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
role here as as a lawyer is to try and

400
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,039
answer uh to the following question so

401
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,960
how do we get here

402
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
how did it happen that

403
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
such a huge and invasive

404
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
market that deals with an incredibly

405
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
sensitive aspect of our culture our

406
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
society

407
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,679
how did it happen that this market is

408
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
basically growing unregulated

409
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,880
unsupervised

410
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
and

411
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
sometimes even

412
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,880
just

413
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,120
being a mockery of actually of the

414
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
principles that should uh inform the the

415
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
the digital sphere

416
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,640
we've seen that uh

417
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
especially when we investigated pornhub

418
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,720
we realized that on one end we have a uh

419
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
official and formal

420
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,799
statement of acknowledging different

421
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,880
gender orientation different sexual

422
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
preferences uh with the nine

423
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,880
possible categories of

424
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
of sexual orientation that a user is

425
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
allowed to uh

426
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
express

427
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,600
to the platform before navigating it but

428
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,160
in fact the algorithm is biased in the

429
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,360
sense that basically gives you either

430
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,679
straight heteronormative

431
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
content recommendation or the weird

432
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
counter recommendation you know

433
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,000
um is this even legal

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
how does it work right this is the the

435
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
the starting point of what i'd like to

436
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,200
discuss with you today um

437
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
and

438
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
the answer is not

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
that simple and this is especially

440
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,440
because of this word that you see right

441
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
here this legal vacuum

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
concept that uh may be not too familiar

443
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
for most of you for uh

444
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,000
legal for us legal people dealing with

445
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,080
the digital world it's actually the the

446
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,799
norm it's our everyday life is this a

447
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
legal context in which things are not

448
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,520
clear there is no applicable law or in

449
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
which some injustice

450
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
is uncorrected

451
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
this has been for a very long time the

452
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
as i said the general norm for the

453
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
digital world we are slowly trying to

454
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
fill up the void to

455
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,000
put

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
new solutions new ideas into this vacuum

457
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
of course

458
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
i can speak for the european

459
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
legal

460
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
context and many many step forwards have

461
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
been done but in the us is the same i

462
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,640
think for instance at all the new acts

463
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
that came out in california with the um

464
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
california consumer privacy act and the

465
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
california privacy rights act if i'm not

466
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,720
mistaken

467
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
so yeah

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
we are slowly and

469
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
slowly as a double meaning in this

470
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,720
context because it's the usual slowness

471
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,080
of the legal world and also the

472
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,919
the fact that the digital world is by

473
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,760
nature very very fast compared to the

474
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,360
other things of the world we we see it

475
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,080
every day and and so uh when you think

476
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,919
of the fact for instance uh julia

477
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,080
mentioned gdpr which is the general data

478
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
protection regulation in its force in

479
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
europe since 2018 well it took 20 years

480
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
to to to come up uh with that because

481
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
the the law that was existing before

482
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,320
that

483
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,960
was from 1995 and um

484
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
and yeah you see

485
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
i will talk more about it in the

486
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
upcoming slides but i'm what i'm trying

487
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
to do here is to give you the the

488
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,919
feeling of

489
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,880
uh the the different uh

490
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
uh pace different speed uh that

491
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,120
that you can experience in the digital

492
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,400
world and in the legal world uh compared

493
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
so about this legal vacuum legal vacuum

494
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,919
is a

495
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,919
it's a catch-all term we can actually

496
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,720
divide it a little bit more and try to

497
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
understand it and understand it a little

498
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,640
bit more of course it's the lack of

499
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,360
norms in general uh it's that's quite

500
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
intuitive but um in in this case um we

501
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
can think of it at every level every

502
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,039
kind of norm so it can either be actual

503
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,200
law like so

504
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
international conventions or national

505
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,480
law you name it uh or also other kind of

506
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
rules other kind of norms let's think of

507
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
internal policies of these platforms i

508
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,320
mean

509
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
maybe we don't even have

510
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
to talk about these

511
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
problems if only the pornographic

512
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
platforms were to have uh

513
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,280
decent policies of content moderation

514
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
and that

515
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,080
and protection of personal data of their

516
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
users but

517
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
here we are so apparently something

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,559
didn't work out as planned and um the

519
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,760
problem is that

520
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
that's not even the only thing that

521
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
we're lacking right here because lack of

522
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,360
concept

523
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,960
is also a huge component of this legal

524
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
vacuum

525
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
because you see

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,320
there is um

527
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,360
so lawmakers are basically people and we

528
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
are people too so we can somehow imagine

529
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
to be lawmakers ourself and if if we if

530
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,880
we try and imagine ourselves having to

531
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
create new rules

532
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
for the digital world especially when it

533
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,520
comes to the pornographic uh word

534
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,960
we actually don't have categories we we

535
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
we would uh immediately uh

536
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
meet a lack of principles um think of

537
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,080
revenge porn uh you might you may have

538
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
heard about this this very problematic

539
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
practice that is happening the it's the

540
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,760
proper term for it would be

541
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,480
non-disclosure dissemination of intimate

542
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
context basically is when

543
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,080
some somebody is sharing the uh a naked

544
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,559
picture of somebody else without uh his

545
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,799
or her them consent their consent and um

546
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
it took so long

547
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
to the legal community to start

548
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,159
acknowledging the concept of uh actual

549
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,720
actually the intimate material the idea

550
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,520
that a photo a video can actually be not

551
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
only just a good that you trade an

552
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
exchange an inter source of

553
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
entertainment but it can also be a mean

554
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
of sexual expression of an individual

555
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,360
and actually sexual expression is

556
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,240
another principle that it's not really

557
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
clear in the in the in the legal world

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
think of uh of that think of the gender

559
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,440
expression i mean it's a huge topic

560
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
right now and and

561
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,960
there are

562
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
of course uh everybody should have the

563
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
freedom to express themselves there is

564
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,799
the right to self-determination that

565
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,840
appears here and there in uh

566
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,200
everywhere

567
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
especially in the

568
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
western

569
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
judicial

570
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,440
cultures but um

571
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
we don't really have a legal theory that

572
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
encompasses all the aspects of what we

573
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,960
could understand as gender expression

574
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
and so this is this makes it even more

575
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,559
difficult and

576
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,240
of course

577
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
as if this was not enough already there

578
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,440
is also a serious lack of political will

579
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
to tackle these problems to to tackle

580
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,960
the legal vacuum especially in the

581
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,240
pornographic sphere online pornography

582
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,559
but also in the digital world in general

583
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,039
right now this last part that i just

584
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
said is changing because of of course

585
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
how catchy the the all the digital

586
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,279
topics are but imagine

587
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,679
again put yourself in the lawmakers

588
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,799
dress right in in in their shoes and try

589
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,279
to imagine going to your electoral uh

590
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,000
base to to to do the people that support

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
you and say that tomorrow you want to

592
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
dedicate your work and your time in

593
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
protecting the right of i don't know on

594
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
online pornography models or uh people

595
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
who want to

596
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,919
just access these

597
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
porn platforms right it's it's not

598
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,440
exactly the most appealing thing

599
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,679
given also the cultural taboo we will

600
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,740
get back on it very very very soon

601
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,400
[Music]

602
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
so

603
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,760
questions like uh

604
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
i don't know like

605
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
is it convenient for

606
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
a political figure to address the kind

607
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
of topics can actually be a slippery

608
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,919
slope and at least for sure it's one of

609
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,720
the main problems that is

610
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,039
making the filling up of this vacuum

611
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
very very difficult and now uh you see

612
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,039
at the bottom of this slide i i'm

613
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,120
quoting ludwig van der rohe the famous

614
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,679
architect with this very famous sentence

615
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,159
less is more because we may think that

616
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,400
actually um

617
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,360
sorry

618
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,039
we may think that actually

619
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,000
less

620
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
rules less norms especially i guess the

621
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,600
most uh libertarians anarchist people in

622
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
in the

623
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
in the room today may probably agree

624
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
with this uh not always too many rules

625
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
means less problems

626
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,880
but is it is it is it the case for us

627
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,720
right now

628
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
so let's talk about the

629
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
the european context again this is

630
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
probably a bit far away from i don't

631
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,320
know is there any person from europe or

632
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,559
is there is not from the us in the room

633
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,960
oh okay

634
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
okay so um but don't worry american

635
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
friends this can actually be a huge an

636
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
interesting perspective for you as well

637
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
um so um

638
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
you see i mentioned gdpr you see it in

639
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
the first line general data protection

640
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,000
regulation um this this has been a huge

641
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
thing for for us in europe but not only

642
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
for us because the gdpr applies to any

643
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,200
subject who is running business in the

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,279
eu so even if you're not european

645
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,279
citizen but you want to run business in

646
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
eu you still need to uh take care of

647
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,679
this uh

648
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
and and be careful uh not to violate

649
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,840
this rule so because the fines are very

650
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,960
very high

651
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
and

652
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,520
this rule

653
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,240
this this regulation specifically

654
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,640
as the merit to have introduced a

655
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
beautiful concept that

656
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
was discussed for a very long time but

657
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,679
it took very long to appear in a legal

658
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,840
text which is the concept of privacy by

659
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
design

660
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,200
as opposed to privacy by default so that

661
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
at some point um

662
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
platforms had to realize that to ensure

663
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,159
privacy of their users would not uh is

664
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
was not enough to just promise that they

665
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,080
will do it

666
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
it's not enough to just say don't worry

667
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
we will take care of it you have to

668
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,440
prove that the design of your platform

669
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,279
the cyber security measures that you put

670
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
in place the the the whole architecture

671
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,480
of your algorithms is actually

672
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,600
privacy oriented there was a huge

673
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
step forward for the data protection law

674
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
community and it only happened

675
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
four years ago let's say six because the

676
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,600
regulation was approved in

677
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,120
2016 but uh

678
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
still it's i mean computers have been

679
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
around for a bit longer than that

680
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,799
um

681
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,120
again going back in time we have the

682
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,440
privacy privacy directory the privacy

683
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,279
and electronic commerce directive that

684
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,080
you see since 2022

685
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,679
that was actually also very important

686
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,760
because it introduced concepts like data

687
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,159
retention uh the the limits to data

688
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,080
retentions and also was one of the first

689
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,600
attempt in europe to uh regulate cookies

690
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
that was a it was a huge topic back then

691
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
it is still now and also the e-commerce

692
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,039
directive the e-commerce directive as

693
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
the merit of introducing one of the

694
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,520
first attempt to categorize digital

695
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,919
platforms in the text of the norm they

696
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,919
are called intermediary service

697
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,360
providers

698
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,919
or isp also called internet service

699
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
providers if you like and they

700
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,480
introduced a brilliant idea of dividing

701
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,159
them in three categories three

702
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,360
categories

703
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,320
one

704
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,960
well not that it matters but one is

705
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,679
mere conduit one is a cash provider one

706
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
is hosting provider funny thing about

707
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,679
this categorization is that eventually

708
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,799
uh the last one the the hosting provider

709
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
category uh have become the the main one

710
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,399
and which is good for for for many

711
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,159
reasons because um

712
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
it's actually a gradual uh

713
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,120
increase of norms and regulation coming

714
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,399
from the first one that i mentioned the

715
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
mere conduit

716
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,760
going through the cache and then the

717
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
hosting provider so hosting providers

718
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
have to abide more rules than the others

719
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,679
that i've mentioned and right now maybe

720
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,919
some of you have heard about it uh the

721
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,679
digital service act and the digital

722
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,060
market act in europe these two two

723
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,679
[Music]

724
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,279
new

725
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
regulations that are about to be

726
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,039
put in place a couple of years hopefully

727
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,399
we'll also

728
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,039
implement even more this concept so i'm

729
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,919
i'm trying to give you some very basic

730
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,799
uh not even legal tools but just uh

731
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,440
juridical uh

732
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,320
ideas to play with uh

733
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,039
because right now uh we will start now

734
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,919
uh

735
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
diving into the any possible legal

736
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
solutions or at least a legally informed

737
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
perspective to this pornographic uh

738
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,240
word the online pornography where they

739
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
were trying to understand a little bit

740
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,440
better so

741
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
legally speaking what about porn

742
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
platforms

743
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
the first sentence that i decided to

744
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,520
mention here in the in the slide is from

745
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
potter stewart american uh legal scholar

746
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
judge and a lawyer um well this this

747
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,600
sentence is out of context but it was

748
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
during the trial he was trying to

749
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
express

750
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,159
uh what um what the pornographic content

751
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,640
is what what a paranormal parliamentary

752
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
material is i'm sorry for the loss in

753
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,559
translations we are not english native

754
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,799
speakers so sometimes i can get clumsy

755
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,039
anyhow he was talking about this uh

756
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,679
pornographic image and he said i shall

757
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
not today attempt further to define the

758
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
kind of this kind of materials but i

759
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
know when i see it

760
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
so you see when he used this sentence

761
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,039
well it was long ago i think in the 60s

762
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,240
or even late 50s anyhow when he used

763
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,320
this sentence um

764
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,600
he gave the perfect example of what's

765
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
the difficulty of wanting to talk about

766
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
something that we can't even define

767
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,279
and even more than that we don't dare to

768
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,399
define because of the cultural taboo

769
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,960
again we will get to it just trying to

770
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
plant a seed right now

771
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
[Laughter]

772
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,679
but yeah we still have this problem

773
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,200
nowaday it's it's still a a way to to to

774
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,399
giggle to to to think that it's uh

775
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
a bit of a

776
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,159
naughty thing to talk about pornography

777
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,760
right even though it's in the everyday

778
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
life of uh the majority of the people we

779
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,320
know especially the younger the the

780
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
younger generations

781
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
and and we can already see the the the

782
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,640
consequences of that so uh the idea is

783
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,760
to uh

784
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
the the the reason why i decided to to

785
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,039
start with this uh uh quote is because i

786
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,720
think that there is a

787
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
clear mistake that we should uh surpass

788
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,799
uh we should try to there and define

789
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,720
what we're talking about uh when we talk

790
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,039
about porn

791
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
producing selling and possessing porno

792
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,760
is still in legal in many nations

793
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
this is funny right because raises a

794
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
question when we want to find legal

795
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
solutions or any kind of solutions to

796
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,919
the pornographic word we still have to

797
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
worry if uh i mean is this a first word

798
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
problem

799
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,039
if you allow me this clearly uh joking

800
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,840
expression

801
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,360
um i don't think so

802
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
but in a certain sense it is uh for sure

803
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,200
uh when we when we look at the at the at

804
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
the

805
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,399
data when we look at the at the map of

806
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,120
the globe we see that uh porno is

807
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,519
illegal in most of the countries that

808
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,840
don't belong to the western bloc the

809
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
western quarter of the

810
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
of the planet

811
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,279
uh

812
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,200
nevertheless we can't deny that the

813
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,360
industry affects the whole planet

814
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
especially considering that many of the

815
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,559
actors

816
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,360
voluntary or involuntary actors that end

817
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,240
up on these platforms come especially

818
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,880
from the other parts of the world so um

819
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
so the problem is global but there is

820
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,440
probably a clear power dynamic going on

821
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,799
this is uh

822
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,120
also a way for us to be a bit more aware

823
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,480
of uh the the colony colonial

824
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,080
implications of of yet another part of

825
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,240
the world and not the digital world

826
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
and um

827
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,039
there has been a significant effort to

828
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,159
stop child pornography and

829
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,760
non-consensual pornography so the reason

830
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,679
why i mentioned that here in the in the

831
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,279
third point is because um after making

832
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,960
you feel guilty and making you feel a

833
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,199
bit worried probably about how big this

834
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
uh this issue is how big the problem

835
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
that we're trying to solve is um there

836
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
are actually already some very relevant

837
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,119
and actual uh

838
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,918
effective solution in place they are all

839
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,119
very uh

840
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,000
narrow in their focus given the the the

841
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,399
the huge dimension of the problem uh at

842
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,119
the end uh but yet the the they are

843
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,040
they're focused and partial uh to this

844
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,199
specific topic but yet very important i

845
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,639
think as i i was mentioning

846
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
non-consensual pornography but child

847
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,079
pornography is also very obvious in

848
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,159
these cases uh of course um it's easier

849
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,800
for a lawmaker to imagine a solution

850
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
first off because creativity apparently

851
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,679
they say works better when it's limited

852
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,440
in a specific context and also because

853
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,719
it's not only the sexual expression of

854
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,839
those who make porn porno or

855
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,119
consume porno but it's also

856
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,720
a matter of protecting the rights of

857
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,200
other people that may get hurt in the

858
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,400
transaction in the in in this in this

859
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
dynamic so what we can see

860
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
we can see a growing effort in

861
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,760
preventing underage users to access

862
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,520
online pornography

863
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
this is a this is another thing that uh

864
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,920
for instance right now in the uk

865
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,240
well right now a couple of years back

866
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
started maybe a little bit more but also

867
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,839
in other places of the world that's

868
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,520
that's a that's uh that's a topic that

869
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,119
it's interesting because it i mean

870
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,320
of course of course we we we want to to

871
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,480
imagine a a a safer way to to

872
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,720
to protect the the underage the most

873
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
sensitive people those who are still

874
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
maturing and creating their own their

875
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,560
own sexual uh

876
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,599
persona uh from uh an unlimited and uh

877
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
uh reckless access to these sometimes

878
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,440
even uh difficult to to digest to

879
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,520
understand kind of contents but on the

880
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,119
other end think of the solutions that

881
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,400
have come out

882
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,280
uh

883
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
when thinking of how to prevent underage

884
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
users to access online pornography the

885
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,320
idea of requiring an id when you connect

886
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,599
on the internet

887
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,400
that's that's that's even worse i mean

888
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,160
of course the the the problem of uh

889
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,079
miners watching porns can be very uh

890
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,560
upsetting but we always have to be

891
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
careful when we think of solving a

892
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,720
problem not to solve it with an even

893
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
bigger problem right because i don't

894
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,119
think that anybody here would be happy

895
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,240
with a

896
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,839
computer that asks you to show your

897
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,320
driver's license before you log into

898
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,880
whatever you want to log into that day

899
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,320
and yeah

900
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,079
an interesting debate has also sparked

901
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
over the addictive nature of mainstream

902
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
pornography content that's also very

903
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,920
interesting and and recent and again

904
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,760
talking about solutions um

905
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
well

906
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,040
imagine a word

907
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,680
where like for cigarettes or well

908
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,359
usually in

909
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,880
i mean

910
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,000
some of these

911
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,599
cigarettes is a good example actually

912
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,359
imagine a word where where you have to

913
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,200
show a banner that says porn is

914
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,359
addictive every time

915
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
you access uh

916
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,119
any video or any content that may

917
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,240
involve uh explicit uh display of a

918
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,359
human body it's actually display of

919
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,359
human body uh that that's a that's

920
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,119
another kind of solution that can be

921
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,280
that's that's a word we don't live in

922
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,160
that we can imagine and um

923
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
but then again it's uh

924
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
it can also be

925
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
give specifically when recognizing the

926
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,040
addictive nature of this uh of this kind

927
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,960
of contents it can also be yet another

928
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,480
way to to to create dystopian and creepy

929
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,640
uh solutions think of all those who just

930
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,720
would like to ban pornography all

931
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,320
together from the internet because it's

932
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,640
obscene because it's wrong because

933
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
it's not uh

934
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
it's not clean it's dirty right and and

935
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,680
so people would just like to suppress

936
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,800
that and think of all the people that

937
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,320
work in the industry and maybe have this

938
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
as the only source of income think of

939
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
all the people that just like to do it

940
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
can we really make that illegal this is

941
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
a question that i'm raising because we

942
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,359
will carry it with us to the next part

943
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,520
and the final part of this uh

944
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
conversation that we're having today by

945
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,599
the way in case you want to interrupt

946
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,960
ask questions

947
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
i don't know raise the point feel free

948
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,079
that there is a microphone over there

949
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,440
you can just raise your hand interrupt

950
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
me whenever you want

951
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,240
and just to i was just checking the

952
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,000
bible okay

953
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,680
some open issues

954
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,000
of course there are the the the the

955
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,359
issues that i just described are

956
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,520
actually issues where i could if you

957
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,119
want later on because we don't have time

958
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,119
right now point you some solutions

959
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,119
somewhere in the world where legal

960
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,280
people or lawmakers are trying to tackle

961
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,800
these issues but there are still some

962
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,119
other open issues such as this of course

963
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,440
is not a complete list sex worker and

964
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,119
prostitutes rights

965
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,599
we still have to remember that

966
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
again talking about pornhub for instance

967
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
it's very recent their decision to

968
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
remove from their platforms all the

969
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,240
non-consensual material that was still

970
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
there and think of all the people that

971
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,079
ended up without their will because they

972
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,560
were unaware of it or also those who

973
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,480
were forced to end up there what's

974
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,839
what's with these people what what's

975
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,520
with the sex workers

976
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,599
uh of course uh it this is yet another

977
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
huge topic uh and we don't we when we

978
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
think about the rights of sex workers we

979
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
always have to remember in my opinion

980
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,720
that most of them work mainly online

981
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
nowaday

982
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,880
what about the privacy both of of these

983
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
workers and the users

984
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,680
specifically this topic is uh is very

985
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
dear to me

986
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
also given the research that we have

987
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,040
conducted with trucking expos that julia

988
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,420
was telling you about earlier on um

989
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,520
[Music]

990
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,280
there is a lot of data going on in this

991
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
market i mean

992
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,680
this raises many questions for instance

993
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,720
is uh my search history on a porn

994
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,839
platform

995
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,240
sensitive data

996
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,920
that's that's a question but it sounds

997
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,560
very legal like this i can also rephrase

998
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,079
it in a different way would you share

999
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,319
your search history on your favorite

1000
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,520
born platform with the with a friend or

1001
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,160
an acquaintance or anybody or would you

1002
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,079
actually think that that's um that's

1003
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,119
part of your very intimate life i don't

1004
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,960
know i'm asking you these questions

1005
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,400
because i know the answer actually i

1006
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,680
don't think that anybody can know an

1007
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,119
answer that fits for

1008
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,119
to all but because

1009
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,240
we should

1010
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,359
start

1011
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,040
this conversation

1012
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,440
we should try to ask ourselves if we

1013
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,720
don't want

1014
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,160
other people lawmakers figure powers

1015
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,400
power figures to

1016
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
decide for us we should start asking

1017
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
ourselves what's the solution that i

1018
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,119
would like to see in the world and

1019
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,560
what's the role of pornography in our

1020
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,119
society that's that's the question

1021
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,000
i mean

1022
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,720
is it just wrong

1023
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,119
is it

1024
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,400
is it maybe

1025
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,839
natural or i don't know is it a business

1026
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,599
that it's still worth preserving i don't

1027
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,920
know these are all questions that

1028
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
we should ask ourselves a little bit

1029
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
more often i think

1030
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,119
uh also because you see when we this is

1031
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,720
the final part of the presentation by

1032
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,839
the way when we when we think of

1033
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,680
solutions when we try to uh harvest

1034
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,440
do you want to ask a question at some

1035
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,359
point

1036
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,800
do you actually know about the

1037
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,839
discoverability and retention period

1038
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,720
of uh search logs import hubs properties

1039
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
um i mean i know that they're that it's

1040
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,560
written in their privacy policy but

1041
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,800
there is no way for us to know actually

1042
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,960
what's happening in their company's

1043
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,480
server so

1044
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,839
i think it's four years

1045
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,680
was it the right answer

1046
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,170
i don't know

1047
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,000
[Laughter]

1048
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
i mean their transparency report mostly

1049
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,119
talks about their reports to the nick mc

1050
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
and their content moderation policies

1051
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
and not their privacy policy as far as i

1052
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,640
could tell

1053
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,839
yeah i'm looking forward to see their

1054
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
transparency reports especially when the

1055
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,760
dsa the digital services act will come

1056
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,680
into force because there is an article

1057
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,480
that will force uh large online

1058
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,400
platforms to make yearly transparency

1059
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,319
reports which we which not all of them

1060
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,520
do right now

1061
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,760
and also not only that they will have to

1062
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,079
apply to very strict criteria so it will

1063
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,240
not be your own made transparency report

1064
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,119
will be much more well full of stuff

1065
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,920
hopefully we will see

1066
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,440
i don't know if i answer to your

1067
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,680
question i have a larger question i i

1068
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,800
fail to understand what your problem is

1069
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,680
with pornhub's recommendation system

1070
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,560
and

1071
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,079
you know what the expectations of

1072
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,960
pornhub users are about

1073
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,839
what

1074
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,119
kinds of videos are suggested to them

1075
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,040
you know i can i built recommender

1076
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,839
systems and i can understand how they

1077
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,119
might be better at doing the

1078
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,640
heteronormative

1079
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,359
recommendations and categorization than

1080
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,480
doing the kinky side of the the house

1081
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
because there's much less history much

1082
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
less tagging much less

1083
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,599
crowdsourced information and metadata

1084
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,920
about that kind of content so it

1085
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,480
wouldn't be that easy for them to

1086
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,920
categorize

1087
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,000
people's kinks you know especially when

1088
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,599
they're

1089
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,480
you know they might cluster in strange

1090
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,720
you know less traditional ways

1091
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,880
so i'm not sure what your problem was

1092
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,119
with them to actually go back to the

1093
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,119
initial talk i mean i don't know if

1094
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
julia wants to pick this one yeah but

1095
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,760
it's not just our problem i mean since

1096
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
the 80s feminism

1097
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,359
has

1098
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,040
if you could take your mask off it might

1099
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,280
be better

1100
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,359
i forgot about that

1101
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,599
um i mean it's not just

1102
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,560
our problem with that

1103
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,200
it's a feminist problem since the 80s

1104
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,319
there was

1105
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,440
there were there were on pornography so

1106
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
the idea that

1107
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,240
these recommender systems can now

1108
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,530
radicalize people and

1109
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,760
[Music]

1110
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,920
has i mean if you

1111
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
see that

1112
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,040
facebook

1113
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,160
or instagram can

1114
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,319
shape your reality

1115
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,599
why

1116
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,079
this platform shouldn't

1117
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,040
shape your sexuality because a lot of

1118
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,560
videos in pornhub are abused

1119
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,160
are just uh i mean it is paid paid a

1120
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,520
price film filmed the prostitution

1121
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,960
so

1122
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,240
i'm sorry

1123
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,800
what were your findings that people's

1124
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,839
sexuality was being steered in a way

1125
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,920
that was inappropriate or wrong we are

1126
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,040
not at that point yet because

1127
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
there is a lot of work that has to be

1128
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,240
done first and to

1129
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,880
identify how this can

1130
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,760
affect the population

1131
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,080
as

1132
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,680
[Music]

1133
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,520
a sociological

1134
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,200
problem

1135
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,400
i mean uh can't be

1136
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,079
technical

1137
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,520
the solution

1138
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,880
of a social problem no don't you again

1139
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,599
if i may step in um

1140
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,520
beside the fact that the that

1141
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
you you you're perfectly described in

1142
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,920
your own questions uh question the the

1143
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
the main problem of it right you said we

1144
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,359
have less less data for this uh outs

1145
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,720
outskirt fringe of uh sexualities and

1146
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,960
gender orientation so our algorithms

1147
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,440
cannot be very uh

1148
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
like as as precise as for the let's say

1149
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,160
main

1150
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,480
mainstream basic sexual orientations

1151
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,079
right and um

1152
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,920
wouldn't it be already enough to ask

1153
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,560
ourselves if we uh are fine with making

1154
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,960
these kind of algorithms and

1155
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
just to answer the question of we don't

1156
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,839
have evidences of the actual change of

1157
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,480
sexual orientation or

1158
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,760
any other empirical uh

1159
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,680
measurement of the impact of this

1160
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,079
content recommendation but if we want to

1161
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
keep it a bit more simple it's quite

1162
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,040
intuitive

1163
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,560
we can imagine that

1164
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,040
especially a young

1165
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,599
person that is accessing a platform

1166
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
without knowing how the algorithm works

1167
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,079
without knowing how the content is

1168
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,040
recommended to the to them well the the

1169
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,760
these these young people will just you

1170
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,839
know consume what they see and what they

1171
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,520
have and what if the algorithm has

1172
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,839
decided that you are heterosexual or

1173
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,680
homosexual when actually inside of you

1174
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,800
you are still

1175
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,640
forming a consciousness about it what's

1176
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,880
going to happen with you and we can we

1177
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,119
we could still say that it's

1178
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,800
their fault because they decided to do

1179
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
that they decided to access the platform

1180
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,400
they decided to expose themselves to

1181
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,520
this influence of the algorithm

1182
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,000
we could say that or we could not and

1183
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,240
realize that this is still part

1184
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,040
of of a societal problem this is still

1185
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,400
part of something that we should not

1186
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,119
turn our head away from

1187
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,440
it sounds like no algorithm can do a

1188
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
satisfactory job given the absence of

1189
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,599
uh expectations and norms so i'm not

1190
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,400
sure

1191
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,000
i i think that many people would agree

1192
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,280
with you i i i for one vote and i don't

1193
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,079
know

1194
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,440
could it be a reason to to to re imagine

1195
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,359
these algorithms to i don't know

1196
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,280
introduce a bit more of privacy by

1197
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,480
design or uh i don't know respect by

1198
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,720
design i don't know i i don't know if i

1199
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,319
managed to answer your questions but we

1200
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,559
can continue afterwards thank you so uh

1201
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,440
that

1202
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,960
dovetails nicely into this online

1203
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,119
question traditionally the porn industry

1204
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,200
has been the technology leader pushing

1205
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,400
vhs over betamax dvd protocol selection

1206
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,880
streaming technologies do you see them

1207
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
leading in solving

1208
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,280
this uh bias algorithm i'm sorry i i

1209
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,040
didn't quite grasp the the

1210
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,240
so

1211
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,800
the porn technology porn industry has

1212
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,720
traditionally been the leader in

1213
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,559
technology selection

1214
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,319
for social for for our media formats um

1215
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,520
do you see them

1216
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,000
being a leader in technology in building

1217
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,960
and solving this uh bias issue

1218
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
that was actually part of the final

1219
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,240
slides that i wanted to to show

1220
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,079
i i will try to answer this question

1221
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,599
also i don't know i don't know how much

1222
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,760
time web left five minutes okay let's

1223
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,800
let's try

1224
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,240
um

1225
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,000
so yeah because the question was about

1226
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,960
solutions and my final slides also so

1227
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,359
what a nice coincidence

1228
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,800
um as

1229
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,119
as you see here um possible approaches

1230
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,800
possible solutions i think that there

1231
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
are at least three one is policy one is

1232
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,280
advocacy and one is litigation that i

1233
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,359
kept for last um

1234
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,160
so policy uh currently most of the power

1235
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,760
and agency over this field is in the

1236
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
ends of the private sector so in this

1237
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
case the the the platforms itself

1238
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,680
and um

1239
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,520
there are many projects to try and offer

1240
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,119
alternatives to mainstream online

1241
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,200
pornography embedding values like

1242
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,359
feminism not conformity of gender sex

1243
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,440
workers empowerment and more

1244
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,040
these are all uh

1245
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,839
interesting projects uh still niche

1246
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,280
still uh

1247
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,240
smaller than the mainstream platforms

1248
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,839
and um and the problem is that the

1249
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,079
public of or at least for what we have

1250
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,920
seen is that the public opinion does not

1251
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,040
seem to see this issue as a priority

1252
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,160
also to this cultural taboo so

1253
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,200
again

1254
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,920
we are as i said before we should always

1255
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,680
remember that we are not talking about

1256
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,160
an emergency in the sense of a priority

1257
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,960
that we have to address we can also

1258
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,520
decide all together as a society or

1259
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,160
individually speaking just to ignore it

1260
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,559
but we've seen all the monsters that are

1261
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,400
coming out of this problem if we don't

1262
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,280
tackle it we have seen what happens when

1263
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,760
we don't

1264
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,040
care about the safety of those who are

1265
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,200
exposed in these videos if you look of

1266
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,119
all the hate that there is online

1267
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,160
against uh well women

1268
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,800
in

1269
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,359
most of the times when they try to to to

1270
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,599
express themselves to show

1271
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,559
their body or also to all the non-uh

1272
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,359
heteronormative orientations whenever

1273
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,839
they show themselves online

1274
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,119
there is

1275
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,520
hatred there is tension and this could

1276
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,880
also be part of the consequences of this

1277
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,040
huge communication machine these

1278
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,280
algorithms that we try to build as good

1279
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,119
as we can apparently

1280
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,440
that still only reiterate the same

1281
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,720
models

1282
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,319
over and over again

1283
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,119
in an incredibly loud

1284
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,839
way some extremists would even call it i

1285
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,079
don't know means of a

1286
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,040
dissemination of rape culture but not me

1287
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,119
another solution could be advocacy

1288
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,040
advocacy is

1289
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,559
of course a way to go to institutions

1290
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,680
and ask for

1291
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,599
for them to solve the problems and uh

1292
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,280
this topic is often not welcomed by

1293
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,599
these political institutions uh pushing

1294
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,280
for openness on these issues may

1295
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,839
escalate in a moral panic as i said

1296
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,680
because on one end you have people that

1297
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,119
are trying to climb this mountain of the

1298
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,720
cultural taboo and on the other end you

1299
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,280
have people that want to push them and

1300
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,000
actually stop it all together from

1301
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,079
from the start and and

1302
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,280
in a

1303
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,520
blind fight against obscenity and other

1304
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,920
forms of extremism just there is a

1305
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,559
toxic debate it's always very difficult

1306
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,160
to actually talk about these things

1307
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,680
because sex has always been an

1308
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,160
incredibly powerful uh

1309
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,559
core element of our cultures or our

1310
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
societies or our history and so it's not

1311
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
going to be easy

1312
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,400
um oh and sorry i forgot to mention you

1313
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,559
see that there is in a yeah up left

1314
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,280
reactive and proactive the policy and

1315
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
advocacy solution can be both reactive

1316
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,839
so you use them after there is a problem

1317
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,599
or proactive you can actually decide to

1318
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,240
try and prevent problems from happenings

1319
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,440
from happening

1320
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
and then there's litigation which is of

1321
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,599
course only reactive when somebody

1322
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,079
violates a norm you can try and and you

1323
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,160
know make them accountable for that and

1324
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,520
it seems to be the most reachable

1325
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,160
approach at the present time is the low

1326
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,079
hanging fruit at least for for our

1327
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,000
experience allows to bring together law

1328
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,359
and technology

1329
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,160
uh

1330
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,880
especially so yeah law exp legal experts

1331
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,720
and i.t specialists can have very

1332
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,000
interesting conversations uh about uh

1333
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,160
about many things apparently with this

1334
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,400
um and involves judges data protection

1335
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,599
authorities and so uh somehow closes the

1336
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,240
gap between people and institutions

1337
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,359
also

1338
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,440
in this and sets very important judicial

1339
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,200
precedents

1340
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,640
but what about you

1341
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
if we still have time to talk about it

1342
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,720
do are you aware of any issue what would

1343
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,400
you like to investigate

1344
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
how which methodology would you use if

1345
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,880
you see any problem in the first place

1346
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,680
but

1347
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,520
i don't know

1348
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,880
if you do

1349
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,160
and and

1350
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,800
and you would like to to the to discuss

1351
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,960
it with us we'll be more than happy to

1352
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,319
to to know what you think uh you can

1353
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,960
again find a lot of material from our

1354
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,960
project on our website attracting

1355
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,240
exposed

1356
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,319
tracking.expose is the main website the

1357
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,520
for the porno project is for

1358
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
