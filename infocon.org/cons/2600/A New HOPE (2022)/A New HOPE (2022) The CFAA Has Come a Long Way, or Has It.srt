with that i want to jump into the panel

and and also level set here for a second

118
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,400
because uh

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
the next panel had cancelled so we don't

120
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
really have a time limit we're gonna go

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
on for a little while longer hopefully

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
and and be able to take more questions

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
and hopefully have answers to those

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,560
questions so let's jump right into it

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
on the 19th of may

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
this year there was a major development

127
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
with the department of justice they had

128
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
revised their guidelines for the

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
computer fraud and abuse act where

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
prosecutions with regard to the computer

131
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,600
fraud and abuse act and

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
to my knowledge i think this is the

133
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
first time that they have revised those

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
guidelines in about 10 years

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,120
and

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
what

137
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
was a major change here was that now

138
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
accessing a computer for the purpose of

139
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
good faith security research

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
was no longer is no longer to be

141
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,319
considered a prosecutable offense so

142
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,840
this is a major

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
and

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
development and could have a huge impact

145
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
on our community

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
ranging from how we collect cyber threat

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
intelligence to how we go about

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
defending our networks and and how we

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
research and even remediate security

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
vulnerabilities so there's some really

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
exciting stuff we're about to dig into

152
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
and we're going to have some really

153
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,319
interesting hypothetical scenarios in

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,800
which we'd all like you to participate

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479

156
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
from your perspective as a lawyer and as

164

is has multiple parts but really is the

172
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
primary tool

173
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
used to counter hacking activity

174
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
a primary tool used by the federal

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
government fbi others

176
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
to uh

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,520
to uh enforce um or to pro to counter

178
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
hacking activity so

179
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
it has an interesting legislative

180
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
history

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,599
um for those of you who have seen

182
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
the film

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
war games going back to 1983 i'd ask for

184
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
a show of hands but i don't think i'd be

185
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,199
able to see that

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,000
um

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,759
matthew broderick high school student

188
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
stumbles upon

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
an enclave

190
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
the war gaming dod enclave and all kinds

191
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,880
of chaos ensues well

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
the then president at the time ronald

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
reagan

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
saw the film

195
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,759
and was so concerned with this kind of

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,879
activity

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
that he implored congress to act

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
and to pass a bill to criminalize

199
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
this activity a bill that he would later

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,280
sign in 1984.

201
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
so

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,039
um

203
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
reality in some cases is a bit stranger

204
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
than fiction and that was the impetus

205
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,639
for the passage of of cfaa

206
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,879
in in 1984

207
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,039
and significantly and we'll talk about

208
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
this throughout our session here

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
there were or there are a couple of

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
terms that are not defined in the

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
statute

212
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
uh and that's

213
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
two significant terms unauthorized

214
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
access

215
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,719
and exceeds authorized access

216
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,159
so neither of those which are key

217
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
components of the statute

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,839
are defined and that's led to really

219
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,799
almost

220
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
40 years or so or so of split authority

221
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,279
and and confusion that has been

222
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
addressed recently through this doj

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
guidance and some supreme court action

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
fantastic thanks jay joel what about you

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
as an active fbi agent your experience

226
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
with the cfa anything to add to what

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
jade mentioned so yeah so first i just

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,519
want to say thank you for for having me

229
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
um i am spot the fed on easy mode with

230
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
my suit jacket but surprisingly no one

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
came up to me and said hey you know

232
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
you're the fed i win the prize um so

233
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
maybe maybe after the talk now that i've

234
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
outed myself i'm expecting people to to

235
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
approach me um so cfaa so a little bit

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,279
of inside baseball with the fbi we don't

237
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
call it the cfaa we call it 10 30 10 30

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
is the actual

239
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
part in the u.s code that if you want to

240
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
find the language that was enshrined

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
with the cfaa it is section 18 usc

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
1030. um

243
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
i work cybercrime

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
and 1030 is one of the basic tools that

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,200
we use that

246
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
gives us authority from congress to

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
um investigate network intrusions

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
and as a

249
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,920
investigator the types of things that

250
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,000
i'm concerned about with the with uh you

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
know interpreting

252
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
1030 is um there's certain elements you

253
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
need to hit so for instance um protected

254
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
computer

255
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,839
if a victim or a complainant comes to us

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,959
and says hey uh we've been affected by a

257
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,320
network intrusion i've got to think to

258
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
myself is this a protected computer

259
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
under the statute and then if that

260
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
element is is

261
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
met then i move on and um

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
i have to look well was did someone

263
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
exceed the authorization they had if if

264
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
the the target had authorization to be

265
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
on the computer did they actually exceed

266
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
it and then the third

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
major prong is um did someone

268
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
not have authorization to access the

269
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
computer and that's basically like how

270
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
detailed we get i'm not an attorney and

271
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,560
so my job is just to bring the facts of

272
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,959
an incident and then let the

273
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
attorneys and the prosecutors do their

274
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
job to interpret what prongs of

275
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
10 30 are actually met for a um

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
for charges so also i'm i'm the only

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,200
non-attorney that's on stage here so i'm

278
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
kind of i see myself as the foil um

279
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,399
so i have a copy of 18 us code 1030 here

280
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,680
and

281
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
i'm reading it and i'm realizing that

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,079
when it was originally written it was

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,880
probably written by people that

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
had never used a computer

285
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
and so you get some really interesting

286
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,160
terms and definitions and you go through

287
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,519
it and there's

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,959
it's it's pretty long and you see that

289
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
there's indentations and you go through

290
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
it and it says if this you know then you

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
know skip to here and there's lots of

292
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
like ands and ors like if this and this

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
or that and then for definitions you

294
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
have to go to a separate part of the us

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,959
code to find definitions of stuff and

296
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
and it's confusing reading it and but

297
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
going through it as a layperson

298
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
i had a very similar feeling to when i'm

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
reviewing like code like like like

300
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
python or c

301
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,360
um and i came to realize that you can

302
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
read 1030 it has if statements

303
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,079
it has um lots of if else else if and

304
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
then it has the variables in the the

305
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
actual definitions um

306
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,360
so

307
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
just in general when i think about 10 30

308
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
it's confusing it's kind of like i would

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
refer to it as a spaghetti code that was

310
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
written in

311
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,800
1980s um

312
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
i i wish it was a little bit more more

313
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
clear for for the purposes of just

314
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
allowing people to understand what is

315
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
across the line and

316
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
easier for someone like me that has to

317
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
actually gather the facts and and

318
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
present them to prosecutors to

319
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
understand better um what actually meets

320
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
the the illegal conduct um

321
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
so my day-to-day focus though

322
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,839
a lot of the things i investigate it's

323
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,839
ransomware it's things that are very far

324
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,560
across the line um with loss amounts in

325
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,440
the

326
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,959
you know tens of thousands of dollars if

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
not the millions of dollars and so we

328
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
don't really have very much gray area

329
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
with with 1030 there isn't a whole lot

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
of debates about whether or not um

331
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
someone interfering with an election

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
system is actually um in violation of 10

333
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
30. so

334
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
like i said my job is just to gather the

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
facts and 1030 is just the tool given to

336
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,600
us by congress

337
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,959
to help us investigate network

338
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,880
intrusions

339
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
i love the analog that you made between

340
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
coding and the conditional statements

341
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,920
that were found in in 1030 and cfaa is

342
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
fantastic sagar i want to pass it over

343
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
to you to talk about any any kind of

344
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
lingering issues with the cfaa that you

345
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,959
want to bring up

346
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,880
thank you and thank you for

347
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
you know to the to hope to having me

348
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,720
here really appreciate it the

349
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
opportunity to speak with you all i do

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
have to make a little copy at the

351
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
beginning which is something that is

352
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
very lawyerly but although i do am an

353
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
employee of the department of justice

354
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
my statements here today are my personal

355
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
opinions and do not represent those in

356
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,399
the department so with that i can talk

357
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
freely

358
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
so um

359
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,320
you know the so as a prosecutor so i'm

360
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,800
thankfully jay uh joel has my help when

361
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
he's interpreting

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
the section 1030 here uh but he's right

363
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,079
you know it is a very complicated

364
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
statute criminal law you know generally

365
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
can be

366
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,639
very complicated but i think on the

367
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
spectrum of complicated statutes 10 30

368
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
certainly is on the kind of more

369
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,959
complicated area

370
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,839
and

371
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,000
it has a complicated history right think

372
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
about this it was written in 1984 right

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,519
there hasn't been any technological

374
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
advances in computing since then right

375
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,639
so

376
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
it is a statute that we are applying

377
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,959
sitting here you know

378
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,160
more than 30 40 years later

379
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
and to apply to

380
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,120
you know hackers today who are causing

381
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,959
you know real harm and my job is to you

382
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
know is generally

383
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
applying the statute i think you know

384
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
joe is right in that

385
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,079
every day in terms of the conduct that

386
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,120
we're investigating in terms of the

387
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
calls that i get that we need to

388
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,680
investigate with the fbi it's it's not

389
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
really

390
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
um

391
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,839
it's not such a fine line between kind

392
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
of what's clearly legal and what's not

393
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,880
the statute is clear on a few things

394
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
they define something as what's a

395
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
protected computer and all that means

396
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
it's a computer that is connected to

397
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,639
interstate traffic which is almost every

398
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,720
computer these days right

399
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
um

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
but the exceeding authorized access and

401
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,480
what is acting without authorization was

402
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
very complicated

403
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,279
and

404
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,880
you know just last year the supreme

405
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,519
court actually ruled in a case uh kind

406
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
of explaining what is the exceeding

407
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
authorized access language

408
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,720
explaining what it was and i'll just go

409
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,759
in that briefly i think it might be

410
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
helpful i think so that was a that was a

411
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,720
case where you know prosecutors charge

412
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
uh effectively a law enforcement officer

413
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,360
who um has access to look up kind of

414
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
criminal history records of individuals

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,399
uh that's part of their general access

416
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
on their computer

417
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
however they were kind of paid on the

418
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
side to look up

419
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,959
uh the same records uh as a personal

420
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,480
matter for someone that they were kind

421
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
of doing a favor with

422
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
uh and so there are the prosecutors kind

423
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,880
of

424
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
working within the law of their circuit

425
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
which is the 11th circuit there's uh

426
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,800
more than a dozen circuits here in the

427
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
united states so each one has its own

428
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
kind of law that is binding on them and

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
working within that case law

430
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
that they decided that because

431
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
even though he had access to do this

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
because he was doing it for a personal

433
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,839
matter not for a law enforcement matter

434
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,399
that he was exceeding his authorized

435
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
access and therefore

436
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,880
violated the statute and so

437
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
prosecutors tried to bring that case

438
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
and i believe he was convicted at trial

439
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
so a jury of 12 found him guilty of that

440
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
statute of this statute

441
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
and it was appealed to the circuit court

442
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
and the circuit court affirmed based on

443
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
that but then the supreme court came in

444
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,959
last year and reversed

445
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,360
basically explaining that if you already

446
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
have access to something uh

447
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
and you're in even if you're not

448
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,440
supposed to look at it right for example

449
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
if you're at work

450
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,519
and you're using computer for work

451
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,120
but you decide to check your personal

452
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
bank account arguably that is also

453
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
exceeding

454
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
authorized access because you're only

455
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,959
supposed to be using your computer for

456
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
work based on your employment contract

457
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,359
but i think ultimately the supreme court

458
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,760
decided that that

459
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,720
conduct can't constitute a crime

460
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,959
under section 1030

461
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
because

462
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
you already had access to it i think

463
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
what the supreme court envisions would

464
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,520
be a violation of the exceeding

465
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,760
authorized access is if you have access

466
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
to a computer but you're blocked off for

467
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
example from a specific drive or a

468
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
folder

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
through technological means

470
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
and if you decide to somehow get around

471
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
that using someone else's passwords

472
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,440
using you know whatever tools you might

473
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,520
have available to you

474
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
through technology if you're able to get

475
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
past that and get into that folder or

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
that drive that would be exceeding

477
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,679
unauthorized access so authorized access

478
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
so that's so it is a very complicated

479
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,679
area supreme court came in and explained

480
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,919
it and we'll talk about that and the the

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,600
regulations and the policies that come

482
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
out but that's where it stands yeah

483
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,720
absolutely and i think also in the

484
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,919
supreme court that you know the

485
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
analogies that they made for things that

486
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
would not violate the cfa in this case

487
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,919
were really interesting i think didn't

488
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,559
they also mention like lying on a dating

489
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,640
profile you know would not violate the

490
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
cfa because there were circuit splits

491
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
about this

492
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
if i recall correctly that established

493
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
that you could violate 1030 if you

494
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
violated terms of service under certain

495
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,080
circumstances exactly so on your

496
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
match.com profile which i'm sure many of

497
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
you might have um

498
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
uh you know if you

499
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,400
lie about yourself technically under the

500
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
the the contract you sign with match

501
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
which is very fine print

502
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,120
and you kind of click in order to

503
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,559
actually get access to it no one

504
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,799
actually reads that we all know but

505
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,160
technically according to that if you lie

506
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
on your profile

507
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
you are automatically

508
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,919
violating their user terms and therefore

509
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,600
you no longer have should have access to

510
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
the website so there is a was a kind of

511
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
aggressive reading of the statute where

512
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,799
if you line your profile you therefore

513
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
no longer have access to

514
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
the site but if you continue on it

515
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
you're exceeding authorized access and

516
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,240
that was kind of something that the

517
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
supreme court kind of shut down uh with

518
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
its opinion yeah i mean it was a

519
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
fascinating case but still so many

520
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
things i think remain unanswered about

521
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,559
it now with this background about cfaa

522
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,320
out of the way i want to

523
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,559
keep with you for a second sagar and ask

524
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,000
you to talk about

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
what what are the role of guidelines in

526
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
the department of justice and and and

527
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,600
jay feel free to chime in here as well

528
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
because you might have some

529
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,679
familiarity with this so can you tell us

530
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,520
about the guidelines how do they bind

531
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
you where do they come from

532
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
yeah so the uh the guidelines come from

533
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
the office of the

534
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,679
deputy attorney general which is you

535
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
know effectively the person sitting

536
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,039
under merit garland but ultimately it

537
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,240
comes from the department of justice

538
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
that very head

539
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
and it's they all the guidelines it's

540
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,000
very long

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
if you want to search you can search for

542
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,200
the basically the justice manual if you

543
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
search google search for that you'll

544
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,280
find

545
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
all of the guidelines that are issued

546
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,480
and that provide what are uh you know

547
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
what they are which are policies to

548
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,360
guide prosecutors and the government um

549
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
as to how we should be exercising our

550
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
discretion when it comes to prosecuting

551
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
these types of crimes so you know they

552
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,960
are

553
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
what they are their policies we do look

554
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
at it very carefully they're very

555
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
important to us and they provide

556
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
guidance in exercising our discretion um

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
you know and we're we are required to

558
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,679
follow them

559
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
that said you know just to be very clear

560
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,559
there's language at the end of every

561
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
single guideline that explains that

562
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
these are internal procedures they're

563
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
intended solely for the guidance of our

564
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
attorneys and they're not intended to

565
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
and may not be relied on to create any

566
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,159
sort of right benefits substantive or

567
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,960
procedural that's enforceable at law uh

568
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
in any litigation

569
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,840
but it's important so let me let me

570
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
interrupt you there for one second

571
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,679
soccer too so so with that in mind the

572
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,880
guidelines

573
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,799
they're not necessarily binding

574
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
on any of the us attorneys any of the

575
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
prosecutors federal prosecutors and i

576
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,679
guess it's an important distinction you

577
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,360
made there too is that they don't

578
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,840
actually change the law right so this

579
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
the computer fraud and abuse act is

580
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,799
still the computer fraud and abuse act

581
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
10 30 is still 10 30. it's just how you

582
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,000
interpret or the facts that would give

583
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
rise to a crime correct and you know we

584
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,159
are the you know where department of

585
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
justice is part of the executive branch

586
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
like you know we're under the president

587
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,919
of the united states technically but the

588
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
courts are not bound by these guidelines

589
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
in any way

590
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,720
uh

591
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
and and neither is congress in any way

592
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,000
this is simply something in the

593
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
department of justice

594
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,320
uh that we have to follow great so so

595
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
alex

596
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
go ahead jay i was just about to bounce

597
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
over to you too

598
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
yeah yeah

599
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,919
one second if we could just interrupt

600
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,159
you we is it possible for you to switch

601
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,799
the hdmi input over to uh

602
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,720
to the laptop here for a second is we

603
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,320
actually have the guideline there we go

604
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,440
split screen all right fantastic jay

605
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
right what i was going to relate because

606
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,520
we're here in new york is an example

607
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,039
that really puts

608
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,799
this struggle to interpret those

609
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,799
guidelines and to use 1030 as a tool

610
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
in in context so

611
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
many of you may remember the cannibal

612
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
cop case yes

613
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,400
in new york gill valley gilberto valley

614
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
uh nypd officer i i think he was a

615
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
sergeant or a detective if i recall and

616
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
in his personal life he was engaged with

617
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,280
a couple of dozen others on a dark net

618
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,400
forum

619
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
that was focused on cannibalism

620
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,039
basically they would talk about it how

621
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
they would how they would like to find

622
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
people to eat

623
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
and it's really strange

624
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
to to even talk about something like

625
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,880
this but it turns out that after years

626
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
of engagement in this forum

627
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
his wife found

628
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
a trove of documents and communications

629
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
that indicated that by the way she was

630
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,159
on that list to be

631
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
captured and eaten at some point and she

632
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
was so concerned about it that she

633
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
reported it to the fbi

634
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
and after a long investigation it turns

635
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,000
out that gill valley the nypd police

636
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,120
officer

637
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
had used

638
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
some of the tools given to him

639
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
access to which he uh

640
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
he was entitled through nypd

641
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,039
to

642
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,799
identify and and run license plates uh

643
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,679
queries uh motor vehicle records for an

644
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,520
individual that he and his

645
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,960
co-conspirators had planned to

646
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
kidnap and and rape and torture and kill

647
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
and ultimately eat

648
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
so a really bizarre case but the

649
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
relationship to 10 30 is that

650
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
that by the way that woman ended up

651
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
being an undercover fbi agent so that

652
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
didn't work out so well for gil

653
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
but he was arrested and charged with

654
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,279
conspiracy to

655
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
commit kidnapping

656
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,480
and the violation of

657
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
title 18 section 1030

658
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
for his misuse of the computer uh

659
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
systems

660
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,000
and running those queries and you know

661
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
on the one hand and this i think is the

662
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,400
the teaching moment on the one hand

663
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
you would say wow well he was entrusted

664
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,960
as a new york city police officer to use

665
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
those systems to further his job and

666
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
fight crime i can't think of a better

667
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,520
case where he's exceeded

668
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,960
his authorized access to use that

669
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
those tools to find someone to kidnap

670
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
and torture and eat

671
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,559
but after being found guilty

672
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
by a jury after deliberation

673
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
that jury that verdict was set aside

674
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
for a number of rounds but regarding

675
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
1030

676
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,360
uh the second circuit and soccer you

677
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,039
mentioned this that the circuits were

678
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,279
split and that's the struggle that we've

679
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,840
had with 10 30. the second circuit felt

680
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,080
that no basically in essence shame on

681
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
you if you authorize someone you give

682
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,720
someone access to a computer system

683
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
if they use it for a purpose that you

684
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
didn't intend

685
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,320
well that's on you you know be more

686
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
careful with who you entrust with access

687
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,159
that's not the intent that wasn't

688
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
congress's intent in passing 1030 it was

689
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
more to prevent people from accessing

690
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
systems that they had absolutely no

691
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,039
access to not for those that were going

692
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,880
to misuse the access

693
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
and interestingly in the case that we're

694
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,480
talking about here the supreme court

695
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,080
case

696
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,919
uh just decided last year the facts are

697
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
very similar right another

698
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,320
law enforcement officer using a system

699
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
he was entrusted to for a purpose

700
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
that wasn't intended and this time the

701
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
supreme court said in in the decision

702
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,080
that uh basically you

703
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,919
what the intent of that statute was

704
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,440
means that you have to access something

705
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
that

706
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
was entirely off limits off limits was i

707
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
think the term used in the majority

708
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
decision that

709
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
it's not that you were you entrusted

710
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
with access and you misused that access

711
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,720
it's something that you were never

712
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
intended to have

713
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,279
you know it's fascinating so many

714
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
presidential cases involve law

715
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
enforcement officers tangled up with 10

716
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
30 or the cfaa

717
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,799
i wanted i want to shift here and dive

718
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,039
right into the actual guidelines

719
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,440
themselves now let's read them

720
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,039
for the benefit of those all the way in

721
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
the back there so the new guidelines and

722
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,080
this is a small excerpt but i think

723
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
a relevant excerpt that we can focus on

724
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
here in terms of our analysis so the new

725
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
doj guidelines that came out on the 19th

726
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,600
of may

727
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
say this they say the government should

728
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
decline prosecution if available

729
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,760
evidence shows that the defendant's

730
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
conduct consisted of and the defendant

731
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,400
intended good-faith security research

732
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
now farther down the guidelines it also

733
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,000
defines good faith security research as

734
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
accessing a computer solely for purposes

735
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,760
of good faith testing investigation and

736
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,559
or correction of a security flaw or

737
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
vulnerability now remember these words

738
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
because they're going to be very

739
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,279
relevant to our hypotheticals that come

740
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
up a little bit later so and or

741
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
correction of a security flaw or

742
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
vulnerability that's an important one

743
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
where such activity is carried out in a

744
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,240
manner designed to avoid any harm to

745
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,720
individuals or the public and where the

746
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
information derived from the activity is

747
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,880
used primarily to promote the security

748
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
or safety of the class of devices

749
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
machines or online services to which the

750
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
accessed computer belongs or those who

751
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
use such devices machines or online

752
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,760
services so jay

753
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
can you can you keep going a little bit

754
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,080
here and talk to us a bit about

755
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
these guidelines how they would relate

756
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
to the private sector and then i want to

757
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,799
pass it back to to joel and saga

758
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,159
yeah so

759
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,320
you know as as the threat landscape has

760
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,600
grown here

761
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,559
and uh the threats are coming from all

762
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
sides they're financially motivated

763
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,279
threats

764
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
their nation-state threats there's a

765
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
whole community that's developed around

766
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,679
the response to these threats

767
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,559
so

768
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,600
we have security researchers we have

769
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,360
digital forensics folks incident

770
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,799
responders i'm sure many in the audience

771
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,880
touch

772
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,799
operate within those circles

773
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,919
and

774
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
the ability to lean forward let's put it

775
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
that way to lean forward to investigate

776
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,559
and engage and understand the adversary

777
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
is impacted by 10 30

778
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
because

779
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,360
there's been that lingering specter or

780
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,559
that concern that if i'm engaged

781
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,279
and

782
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,760
investigating a bad actor

783
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,480
and and on a network or a system

784
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
it the potential for me to run afoul of

785
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
section 1030 and you never know who who

786
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
is on the line so to speak there can be

787
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,880
undercover law enforcement officers and

788
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,919
there could be members of the

789
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,240
intelligence community or other security

790
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
researchers that report on me

791
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,320
as though i'm an active participant and

792
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
a bad actor so

793
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
i think that's the concern that for

794
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
years folks that are operating and

795
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,720
trying to be aggressive and understand

796
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,799
the threat landscape are concerned that

797
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,360
their activity could be construed as

798
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
exceeding authorized access

799
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,720
or

800
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
being unauthorized in some way

801
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,799
and and joel i want to pass it back to

802
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,640
you now what about

803
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
these guidelines has changed the way you

804
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,399
do your business or your viewpoints

805
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,240
so not much has changed to be perfectly

806
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
honest with you

807
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,679
first i just want to say

808
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
if you have an opportunity and if you're

809
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
interested i would seriously check out

810
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,840
the doj prosecution manual it goes into

811
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,600
great detail about the things that

812
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
prosecutors need to think about when

813
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,640
they're

814
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
negotiating a plea agreement or when

815
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
they're determining whether or not

816
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
someone

817
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
deserves to be charged with a felony or

818
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,559
a misdemeanor and it's written in simple

819
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
language unlike the the statutes

820
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
themselves and it's really descriptive

821
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,279
and

822
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,840
it's a level of transparency that um

823
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
they offer that in practice when we're

824
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
sitting when i'm sitting with

825
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
prosecutors and they're explaining to me

826
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,039
why they're going to allow someone to

827
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,559
plead to a misdemeanor or something but

828
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,320
i see them actually go through the steps

829
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,840
so it's not just something

830
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
in writing that is performative it's

831
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,600
something that they actually adhere to

832
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
and um

833
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
it's it makes it

834
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,559
really clear when you have when you

835
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
wonder um like why why did they why did

836
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
the department of justice choose to

837
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
prosecute a certain crime and not uh

838
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,840
some other crime um but in terms of the

839
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,559
guidance itself so after a careful

840
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
reading of the the recent guidance i

841
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
think i think it does two things

842
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,799
first it it codifies uh the van buren

843
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,559
decision that sagar talked about and

844
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,039
basically it it mirrors the language

845
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
that justice coney barrett writing in

846
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,399
the majority

847
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,200
um

848
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
talks about in in the supreme court

849
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,399
decision that

850
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,159
effectively narrows the cfaa and

851
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,240
clarifies some things it turns

852
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,840
it turns 10 30 into a um

853
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
a trespassing statute it's not just a

854
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,240
a break a policy statute you actually

855
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,919
need to trespass into somewhere that you

856
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,000
don't belong and so i think it gives a

857
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,720
lot of clarity

858
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
the other thing that it does is i

859
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,679
it gives comfort to security researchers

860
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,440
who are acting in good faith who are

861
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,760
doing their job and incident responders

862
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,000
who might be afraid of crossing some

863
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
line and exposing themselves to criminal

864
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
culpability

865
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
um yeah there's a lot of attorneys that

866
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,360
usually get involved when there is a

867
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,039
network security incident

868
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,000
and

869
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
in my experience incident responders

870
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,840
they they're hard chargers they're

871
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,840
aggressive they're trying to um

872
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,000
expel the attacker from their network um

873
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,120
they're trying to get their data back

874
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,799
they're trying to mitigate um

875
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,799
and a lot of times they they might come

876
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
up with ideas that are excessively

877
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,080
aggressive and then they they talk to

878
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
their their attorneys and the attorneys

879
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,760
will will talk them down and explain to

880
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
them why you need to be a little bit

881
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,519
more circumspect before you um hard

882
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,240
charge one example and

883
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,600
some of the some of the questions that

884
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,840
get risen are pretty silly like

885
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,960
for instance if an attacker creates a

886
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
dummy account on a linux machine that

887
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
they use for persistence

888
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
um

889
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,080
is the owner of that computer allowed to

890
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,480
go into that account and

891
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
look at what's actually in there or are

892
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
they breaking 10 30. now

893
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,960
for me and i'm like well that's like a

894
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,559
silly question if i go home right now

895
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,919
and i see that someone has created an

896
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,080
account on my computer that like it's my

897
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,840
computer i'm going to i'm going to

898
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
investigate i'm going to wipe that

899
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,799
account but those are the types of

900
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,240
questions when corporate attorneys get

901
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
involved and they start raising these

902
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,159
types of issues where they're really

903
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,000
worried about the

904
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,320
any liability that a company might face

905
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,360
so when i read the part about good faith

906
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,200
security research and good faith

907
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,679
investigation i like to think it's the

908
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
department of justice messaging to

909
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,519
corporate attorneys and and the folks

910
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,360
who are involved in these types of

911
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
matters and saying hey look

912
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
you're not going to be charged for this

913
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
you're not going to be charged with a

914
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,519
felony for

915
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,679
doing something in good faith in fact my

916
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,000
understanding of criminal statutes is

917
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,279
you actually have to have criminal

918
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,640
intent in order to be charged with a

919
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
crime doing something in good faith is

920
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,360
usually the antithesis even if you meet

921
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
all the other technical elements of the

922
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
statute if you're doing something in

923
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,880
good faith it's really hard

924
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
to prove that that person

925
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,799
actually committed a crime

926
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,600
so

927
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
um

928
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,200
i think the guidance is helpful i think

929
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,559
it's helpful for the general public but

930
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,159
it doesn't really change anything that i

931
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,559
do uh just because we're not we're not

932
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,240
interested and and

933
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
we're busy we're very very busy we're

934
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
turning down cases

935
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,679
um where there's real loss amounts and

936
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,840
real victims we're referring those cases

937
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,679
to

938
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,360
state and local law enforcement because

939
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
we just we don't have the resources to

940
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,559
address them and we certainly don't have

941
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,519
the resources nor do we want to pursue

942
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,200
anyone acting in good faith to include

943
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
investigators security researchers and

944
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
the like

945
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
now it's interesting you say that too

946
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,359
because there also seems to be a little

947
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,280
bit of push and pull here

948
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,239
because

949
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,399
you know sagar you mentioned

950
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,879
the deputy attorney general lisa monaco

951
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,639
she's the one that promulgates these

952
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,040
guidelines right so they filter down

953
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,199
now what she had said specifically about

954
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,440
these guidelines are that they are

955
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
intended to quote

956
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,119
focus the department's resources on

957
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,440
cases where a defendant is either not

958
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
authorized at all to access a computer

959
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,480
or despite knowing about a restriction

960
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,639
accessed part of a computer to which his

961
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
authorized access did not extend

962
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,320
so why so if joel if it was the case

963
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,280
then

964
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,879
that we're turning away cases where

965
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,320
there isn't the mental element or

966
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,359
there's there there was uh or rather

967
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,200
there wasn't an absence of good faith

968
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
there's real cases that you're turning

969
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,079
down

970
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,839
why then did these new guidelines have

971
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,760
to come out why did the attorney general

972
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,599
have to do that i guess maybe it's

973
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,359
perhaps because there's differences

974
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,440
between jurisdictions when when it comes

975
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
to the investigation of these types of

976
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,200
crimes so i'm not sure i suspect

977
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
i suspect it was twofold it was to

978
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
codify ban bureau and just formalize

979
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
that of that hey this is the new policy

980
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,040
now uh it's been the law of the land for

981
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,800
over a year but now we just want to make

982
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,440
it clear that it's also doj policy um

983
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,839
and i think the other reason is just uh

984
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,359
to message

985
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,599
uh from the top

986
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,480
that

987
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,880
we're not interested in going after good

988
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,359
faith researchers that like

989
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,320
that isn't as far as i know

990
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
there's been no targeting of good faith

991
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
security researchers now

992
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
there are bad faith security researchers

993
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,040
for sure

994
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,760
um

995
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,880
but there really hasn't been any

996
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,400
targeting it but they just wanted to be

997
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
very explicit when they when they

998
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
message um

999
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
what what prosecutors are supposed to

1000
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
calculate when they're thinking about

1001
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
whether or not there's criminal

1002
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
liability yep and sagar i want to pass

1003
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
it to you for comment on that too yeah

1004
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,040
so i think that look after the supreme

1005
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,119
court decision came out on the exceeding

1006
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,880
authorized access issue i think there

1007
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,560
was an opportunity

1008
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,640
to take a hard look at these guidelines

1009
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
and

1010
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,359
revise them

1011
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,960
excuse me and

1012
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,040
i think you know really the good faith

1013
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,119
researcher

1014
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
language that was just stated is very

1015
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,480
different than the exceeding authori

1016
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
those are two different

1017
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
entirely different issues and i so i

1018
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,040
think

1019
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
the fact that they were revising the

1020
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,079
guidelines anyway they felt you know

1021
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,000
again i cannot speak to why they

1022
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,560
included at that time but i think it was

1023
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,520
a recognition that good faith security

1024
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
research is is really helpful to the

1025
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,119
community

1026
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,560
and in fact you know

1027
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
the lisa monaco the deputy attorney

1028
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
general said quote

1029
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,119
computer computer security research is a

1030
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,560
key driver of improved cyber security

1031
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
the department has never been interested

1032
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
in prosecuting good faith computer

1033
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
security research as a crime

1034
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,000
and today's announcement promotes cyber

1035
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
security by providing clarity for good

1036
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,240
faith security researchers who root out

1037
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
vulnerabilities for the common good end

1038
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,680
quote so

1039
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,839
um and i think she's right i i don't

1040
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,720
think

1041
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
if you look at kind of history of all

1042
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
the crimes that have been prosecuted

1043
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,880
under 10 30 i think there's a couple

1044
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,960
that where you know it's arguable that

1045
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
it was a

1046
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
good faith security researcher who was

1047
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,640
prosecuted this is not an area where we

1048
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,079
are spending a lot of our time and

1049
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,599
resources at all

1050
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,359
right again i think as joel mentioned we

1051
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,440
have more than enough nation state

1052
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,359
actors

1053
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,760
extremely malicious actors to deal with

1054
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
we don't have the resources to go after

1055
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,000
good faith security researchers it's not

1056
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
a priority and and this kind of is a

1057
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,960
recognition of it and just to add to the

1058
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
you know i don't think that these

1059
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,400
guidelines changed anything

1060
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,720
from my perspective because

1061
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,119
again it is a defense under the law if

1062
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
you're acting in good faith uh that's a

1063
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
standard jury strict instruction that is

1064
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,640
kind of given in every jury trial and so

1065
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,839
this just

1066
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,640
is messaging to the public that this is

1067
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,119
something we value and in fact we

1068
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,800
oftentimes look at

1069
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,720
you know threat security reports and

1070
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,320
things like that when we're trying to

1071
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
also do our investigations of various

1072
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,400
apts and things like that

1073
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,079
so a lot of the information that's out

1074
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,839
you know public publicly sourceable

1075
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,359
information is very helpful in our

1076
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,599
investigations and i think

1077
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,760
it shows we value it but ultimately it

1078
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
doesn't change anything what matters is

1079
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,880
um you know what someone's intent is

1080
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
which is kind of what the guidelines go

1081
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,599
to and i think it's also helpful to

1082
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
mention you know

1083
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
the section 1030 prosecutes kind of

1084
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
generally real harm right it's not just

1085
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,000
accessing a computer without

1086
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,040
authorization if you go through there

1087
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
you have to

1088
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,160
obtain information

1089
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,800
you have to cause damage you have to

1090
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,240
have the intent to defraud and obtaining

1091
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,079
something of value of more than five

1092
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,160
thousand dollars we have to recklessly

1093
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,280
cause damage um causing loss

1094
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
trafficking and passwords things like

1095
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,359
that you know these are real

1096
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,480
it's not just

1097
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
accessing computer it's much more than

1098
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
that so there's actual harm that needs

1099
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,720
to be done and and your position and and

1100
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
it seems like joel's too is that because

1101
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
of this mental element what we would

1102
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,160
call a law the men's real right you know

1103
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,800
the

1104
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,160
the mental thing

1105
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,560
uh that has to be present

1106
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,400
these guidelines don't really change all

1107
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,640
that much would you agree jay

1108
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
yeah yeah i i do and let me highlight

1109
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
what what i think is the most important

1110
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,280
part of this policy change because sagar

1111
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
you and and

1112
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,320
and joel have both said in different

1113
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,800
ways joel i think you've said rightly

1114
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,640
that this doesn't change the way you go

1115
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,880
about your business you've got a lot

1116
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
more work than you can ever do so

1117
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,640
you have to decide what's the most

1118
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,880
impactful and where the best use of your

1119
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
time is same for the u.s attorney's

1120
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,680
office

1121
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,119
and i'll say i've spoken to a number of

1122
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,119
people about this a lot of former

1123
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
prosecutors who've said well you know

1124
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,359
yes it's good that doj has come out with

1125
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,280
this announcement this good faith

1126
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,839
security research

1127
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,280
exemption let's call it

1128
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
but you know that in the reality this is

1129
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,839
the way we've operated for many years so

1130
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,920
i don't see it as a big deal

1131
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,359
the the

1132
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,079
the big deal part of it i think and joel

1133
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,319
i think you said this well is that it

1134
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,280
and you two sagar that it's a signal

1135
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
to

1136
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,079
not the security researcher that's just

1137
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
trying to help his or her community or

1138
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
those even maybe they're going after bug

1139
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,359
bounties but the in-house

1140
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,000
cyber threat intelligence teams that are

1141
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,599
working at the large financial

1142
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
institutions or the large pharmas or the

1143
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,280
the multinational retailers they're

1144
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,440
trying to stay ahead of the threats and

1145
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,119
are trying to get authorization

1146
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,560
internally

1147
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
from their legal departments

1148
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,319
to engage with bad actors on forums or

1149
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,720
to access um

1150
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,240
parts of

1151
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,839
of networks that

1152
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
they because of company policy may

1153
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,960
require some pre-authorization

1154
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,240
uh to

1155
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,800
to get the green light to conduct those

1156
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,640
intelligence gathering

1157
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,480
uh operations and for them i think the

1158
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,800
very conservative legal community in

1159
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,520
those large organizations have said for

1160
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,599
many years well we don't like the

1161
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
overall risk that this brings by you

1162
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,920
engaging in this kind of activity

1163
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,079
because well for one it could violate

1164
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,480
title 18 section 1030

1165
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
or it could draw fire from the adversary

1166
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
so you know it's too much risk we're not

1167
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
comfortable with that risk coming on to

1168
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,440
our large organization so

1169
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
we're going to deny this request and

1170
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
that's caused great frustration so

1171
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,400
when you guys talk about a signal

1172
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
i think

1173
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,160
excuse me the u.s attorney's office and

1174
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,760
doj

1175
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,079
is signaling that this community is an

1176
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,480
important player government can't do it

1177
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,760
alone

1178
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,599
private sector can't do it alone to stay

1179
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,960
ahead of the threats here we need the

1180
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,760
security researchers input and we want

1181
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,800
to

1182
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
in empower them

1183
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,640
to to go ahead

1184
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
and and help inform this broader

1185
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,319
public-private partnership community

1186
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,880
of what's going on and how to stay ahead

1187
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,520
and and prevent and mitigate threats and

1188
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
just uh one thing i'd like to add about

1189
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,720
the importance of

1190
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,480
security researchers and people you know

1191
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,560
in the community the hackers folks in

1192
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,440
this room um

1193
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
some of the fbi's best investigations

1194
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,040
really all of them

1195
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
they usually have security researchers

1196
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,839
who bring things to our attention hey

1197
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,560
did you know about these cobalt strike

1198
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,760
team servers

1199
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,640
um did are you aware of this ransomware

1200
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,599
panel that that is open to the public um

1201
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,760
or it's people saying hey are you aware

1202
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,359
that on exploit.in um there's something

1203
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,280
they're selling a network to

1204
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,599
a power plant or a hospital

1205
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,400
and it's

1206
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,480
extraordinarily valuable to us because

1207
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,280
as the government we're encumbered by

1208
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,440
you know just well being the government

1209
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,119
and uh

1210
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,640
um

1211
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,960
we're not we're not allowed to

1212
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,319
do as much

1213
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,720
stuff as folks in in the private sector

1214
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,680
um

1215
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,880
we

1216
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,640
things are very bureaucratic and there's

1217
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,599
layers of approval and so we are slower

1218
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,760
and less agile than than security

1219
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,839
researchers so very often security

1220
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,400
researchers are on the bleeding edge

1221
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,359
of

1222
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,800
information and

1223
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,359
some of the best fbi cases that you read

1224
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,880
about in the newspaper

1225
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,839
um

1226
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,839
they have security researchers who were

1227
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,280
behind the whole thing that were

1228
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,960
basically pointing us in the right

1229
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
direction and giving extraordinary

1230
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,640
assistance

1231
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,680
i i i couldn't agree with you more um

1232
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,640
i've

1233
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,480
i've even you know helped fbi on

1234
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,400
numerous occasions myself

1235
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,599
but i want to ask a really tough

1236
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,640
question

1237
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,119
of all of you here on the panel now too

1238
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
is that this is this will this won't get

1239
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,359
a little contentious because on the one

1240
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,160
hand we're saying we have to

1241
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,920
we need this public-private partnership

1242
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,079
essentially we need we need the help and

1243
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:20,960
also

1244
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,480
we don't want to go after good faith

1245
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,640
security researchers

1246
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,400
and and part of i think these new

1247
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,560
guidelines is helping bridge that gap

1248
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
where there was a gap

1249
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,560
possibly because of some history

1250
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,160
and that history i'm referring to is the

1251
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,640
aaron swartz case which was a 10 30

1252
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,240
charge and was a charge under the

1253
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,680
computer fraud and abuse act and it was

1254
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
a a really beloved and dear member of

1255
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,119
our community

1256
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,920
here and so i want to i want to ask all

1257
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,000
three of you on the panel your your

1258
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,880
thoughts about the aaron swartz case and

1259
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,760
and whether the guidelines today would

1260
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,599
have prevented that charge years ago

1261
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,880
so why do i hand it over to sauger

1262
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,839
uh yeah i mean certainly that

1263
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,480
case was a tragedy uh

1264
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,319
regardless of kind of anyone being

1265
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,480
prosecuted no one wants that to result

1266
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,079
that's never the goal

1267
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:12,960
um

1268
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
you know it's interesting i you know i

1269
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,280
was reading up on it and i and kind of

1270
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,800
reading up on the facts of that case and

1271
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,040
i saw kind of two different versions

1272
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,560
when i was reading up on it you know

1273
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,319
online if you're just kind of generally

1274
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,760
looking at things

1275
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
it was about a guy who you know had

1276
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
access to a computer

1277
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,839
uh went and kind of used something to

1278
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,079
download a lot more things than he

1279
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,960
in a in a quicker way the academic

1280
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
journals the jstor journal you know

1281
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,440
downloading all these journals and

1282
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
you know

1283
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,960
any person can go into mit's campus and

1284
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,359
go to a computer right and you know

1285
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
access these journals and download them

1286
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,440
and look at them and could do that he

1287
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,400
used

1288
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,359
a tool

1289
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,119
uh forget exactly what he was using but

1290
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,319
he used the tool that allowed him to

1291
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,720
download you know it was like automated

1292
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,640
downloading keep grabbing dot p y i

1293
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,280
believe it's called there you go um uh

1294
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,560
you know all you know i think it

1295
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,160
ultimately allowed him to get four

1296
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
million or so

1297
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,880
uh and through so he had access and he

1298
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,480
then used something to accelerate his

1299
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,400
ability to get things but

1300
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,560
under the van buren decision and the you

1301
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,040
know it seems like that wouldn't

1302
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,960
necessarily be something that could be

1303
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,599
prosecutable right now however i

1304
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,200
actually pulled up

1305
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,359
the indictment

1306
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,880
from the

1307
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,960
district of massachusetts and typically

1308
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,079
i was not involved in any way in

1309
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,520
prosecuting this case

1310
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,280
absolutely and in fact i think anybody

1311
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,880
on this panel was at all involved in the

1312
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,319
swartz case yeah

1313
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,040
but it talks about how you broke into a

1314
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,240
restricted wiring closet at mit

1315
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,480
accessed it and then access the mit's

1316
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,079
network without authorization with a

1317
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,079
switch within that closet

1318
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,599
and that's how he was able to connect so

1319
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,960
look i i don't know what actually

1320
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,920
happened

1321
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,359
these are allegations in indictment

1322
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,440
which are not you know proven

1323
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,240
um but you know the latter seems to be a

1324
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
situation where it might still be

1325
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,920
prosecutable under the the section 1030.

1326
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,240
so that's that just shows the kind of

1327
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,920
dividing lines there that's interesting

1328
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,240
so it's still a pretty nuanced area so

1329
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,319
the access perhaps you know through

1330
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,839
through whatever cabinet he'd access

1331
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,240
that might have been the 10 30 violation

1332
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,960
but

1333
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,559
downloading in an automated fashion

1334
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,240
academic journals to which you already

1335
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,319
had access based on the van buren

1336
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
decision that came out not necessarily

1337
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,040
the guidelines

1338
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
it probably wouldn't have amounted to a

1339
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,800
charge

1340
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,400
interesting i'll pass it over to you

1341
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,720
joel

1342
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,119
so i i think what happened with aaron is

1343
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,760
unspeakably sad um

1344
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,200
and i didn't

1345
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,520
know him when he was charged i was a

1346
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,640
baby fbi agent i was still a quantico um

1347
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,640
and i never really even heard about the

1348
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,800
case until i uh

1349
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
moved i worked public corruption part of

1350
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,520
my career and then i moved to cyber um

1351
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,319
seven years ago and um

1352
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,240
i'd never heard of the case and there's

1353
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,480
lots of stuff you can find

1354
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,559
i saw the documentary you can find

1355
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,040
articles um

1356
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,079
about the investigation

1357
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,599
but something like some what makes it so

1358
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,240
tragic is

1359
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,119
aaron's he was a writer and he was a

1360
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,720
thinker and

1361
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
you read some of his

1362
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,160
his essays

1363
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,119
uh

1364
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,200
and i know he's famous for like

1365
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
for reddit and for his political

1366
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,400
activism but the thing that i

1367
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,920
think is the most interesting is just

1368
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,960
his

1369
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,079
his clarity of thought on social issues

1370
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,960
and um about privacy

1371
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,400
and

1372
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,640
even even things that he was just he was

1373
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,200
very he's a curious person so

1374
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,920
you can read his essay about

1375
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,160
um

1376
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,520
keynes's general theory on economics and

1377
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,960
this is something that 19 year olds do

1378
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,640
not read this is something economists

1379
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,079
avoid reading and

1380
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,160
it's just amazing to hear how clearly he

1381
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,400
summarizes it um

1382
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,520
same with like

1383
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,920
david foster wallace uh he read infinite

1384
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,079
jest and then he writes this literary

1385
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,559
criticism as like a 18 year old

1386
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,800
and

1387
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,480
and i i think

1388
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,760
like

1389
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,240
it's awful that we don't have them

1390
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,559
in this decade especially because i feel

1391
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,359
like like now when we're talking about

1392
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,280
things like like moderation on social

1393
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,079
media platforms and uh

1394
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,079
and we're talking about disinformation

1395
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,280
and misinformation

1396
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,480
i would just love to hear like what his

1397
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
thoughts are on it um i think it would

1398
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,760
be very very illuminating just to

1399
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
have his commentary and see how how his

1400
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,960
thought has evolved um

1401
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,559
i'm not sure if the if the guidelines

1402
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,720
that were were released as sagar was

1403
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
mentioning really

1404
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,599
would affect his case because

1405
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,400
this this is more geared towards um

1406
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,079
uh

1407
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,319
security researchers and i think aaron

1408
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
falls more in the bucket of

1409
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,520
uh an activist a civil disobedience

1410
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,119
which which you know our country has a

1411
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,720
rich history of civil disobedience

1412
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
bringing light to

1413
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,079
to laws that are unjust and then the

1414
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,440
laws changing through the democratic

1415
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,400
process

1416
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,520
um so i'm not sure if if this would

1417
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,440
if this new guidance would really

1418
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,720
address his

1419
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,359
specific matter but i do think a lot

1420
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,520
has changed in 10 years

1421
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,280
in terms of the prioritization of the

1422
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,119
type of investigations that the federal

1423
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,200
government is interested in

1424
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,559
ten years ago we didn't have nation

1425
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,839
state hackers breaking into private

1426
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:42,880
companies

1427
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,119
um ten years ago there were no attacks

1428
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,040
on our our democracy um

1429
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,359
ten years ago there was no

1430
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,760
ability to monetize network access for

1431
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,400
100 million or 200 million dollars and

1432
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,559
so i think just the prioritizations

1433
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,280
themselves have changed from um

1434
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,480
looking at these hacktivist cases

1435
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,440
more towards the cases where there's

1436
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,960
enormous loss

1437
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,640
let me let me interrupt and ask you a

1438
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,520
direct question about that too then

1439
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,680
with the shift in priorities if this

1440
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,920
type of case if if the schwartz case

1441
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
came over to you as an fbi agent today

1442
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,880
do you think you

1443
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,559
would say oh my goodness there's there's

1444
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,440
no way that we could go after this

1445
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,960
would this be something you would put in

1446
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,680
the

1447
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,599
never to prosecute or never investigate

1448
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,720
pyle or

1449
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,160
what would happen

1450
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,240
i mean so

1451
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,800
the fbi's job is just to get the facts

1452
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,680
and so

1453
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,960
if this case came to me i mean this

1454
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,520
isn't the type of cases i work um but if

1455
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,880
the case came to me i would i would

1456
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,240
gather the facts

1457
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,040
and

1458
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,200
i would go where the facts take me and

1459
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,760
then i would give them to prosecutors to

1460
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,400
make the decision

1461
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,810
i wouldn't be particularly

1462
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,000
[Music]

1463
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,480
aggressive about

1464
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,680
wanting to work in a hacktivist case um

1465
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,160
because like i said

1466
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,520
like we're turning down we're turning

1467
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
down cases where where victims are are

1468
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,720
losing

1469
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,200
a lot of money and um

1470
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,960
you know there's a lot

1471
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,240
there's a wealth of targets that i think

1472
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,559
would in my mind at least

1473
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,640
we would prioritize over this type of

1474
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,400
conduct but again it's it's not my

1475
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,800
decision my job is to gather the facts

1476
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,599
um

1477
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,240
and to go where the facts take me gotcha

1478
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,400
yeah i appreciate that

1479
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,079
jay what about you

1480
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,400
yeah um i had the benefit earlier this

1481
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,160
week in fact on monday the deputy

1482
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,680
attorney general was

1483
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,559
over

1484
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,400
in our space at ncfta

1485
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,200
national crime uh um cyber forensics and

1486
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,720
training alliance she was there for a

1487
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,240
different reason it was really more

1488
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,880
about how to develop

1489
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,680
a cyber trained workforce

1490
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
within the legal ranks and

1491
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,440
while we were chatting

1492
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,680
in a round table type setting

1493
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,520
i said to her i said by the way thanks

1494
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,760
for the guidance the ethical hacking

1495
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,960
guidance

1496
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,880
it's from all that i've spoken with it's

1497
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,359
been very well received and she i think

1498
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,760
was taken back a bit and said you're

1499
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,680
welcome and i have to tell you it was a

1500
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,680
very easy decision

1501
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,559
it's time when this came across my desk

1502
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,760
uh

1503
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,359
it was time to to signal this change

1504
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,079
that that's interesting you know it's uh

1505
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,680
i appreciate all your thoughts and i

1506
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,760
know that they're all heartfelt and uh

1507
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,079
and speaking about this tragedy and i i

1508
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
certainly hope that

1509
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
the evolution that we've seen

1510
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,119
coming from on high and the supreme

1511
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,640
court together with the change in the

1512
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,400
guidelines the change in the attitude

1513
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,760
from the department of justice from the

1514
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
fbi

1515
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,599
the

1516
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,160
the shifting prioritization i think is

1517
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,920
is such an important point that that

1518
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,559
joel has brought up that that we would

1519
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,319
hopefully never see something this

1520
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,319
tragic affect our community again that's

1521
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,800
uh that's i think all of our hopes here

1522
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,640
i i hope i speak and i'm actually pretty

1523
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,040
certain i know i i i speak for the panel

1524
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,319
in that um but with that i want to

1525
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,280
shift gears for a moment and

1526
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,440
go back to the slide deck here which i

1527
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,960
believe we have on the screen which is

1528
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,119
excellent and move into a couple

1529
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,200
hypothetical situations here where we

1530
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,319
can have some audience participation and

1531
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,079
and get your thoughts on a couple of

1532
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,839
different hypotheticals that our

1533
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,000
panelists have come up with that test

1534
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,319
the limits of what good faith security

1535
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,520
research means and what can and what is

1536
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,319
within and without 1030 or the computer

1537
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,799
fraud and abuse act these days based on

1538
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,440
these guidelines so with that let's move

1539
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,799
into

1540
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,040
hypothetical one

1541
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,280
which i call you know seek and destroy

1542
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,520
here

1543
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,440
so

1544
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,160
the facts are this you know an i.t staff

1545
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,599
with a

1546
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,040
a large professional services

1547
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,559
organization they know we're talking

1548
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,799
about you know perhaps a law firm

1549
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,200
or maybe an accounting firm or you know

1550
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,520
a gaggle of consultants i think that's

1551
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,520
what you call a lot of consultants right

1552
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,720
gaggle

1553
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,880
respond to an emerging cyber security

1554
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,839
incident alarms indicate unusual network

1555
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,680
traffic and data movement

1556
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,400
maybe some data has been exfiltrated

1557
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,720
possibly you know internal staging

1558
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,799
investigation reveals that a large

1559
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,760
amount of this professional services uh

1560
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,839
organization their data was exfiltrated

1561
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,920
to a cloud storage bucket of an

1562
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,599
unrelated organization we're going to

1563
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,799
call that organization abc org

1564
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,319
and the ir team the uh

1565
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,359
finds that the config file needed for

1566
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,960
access to the abc org bucket is there

1567
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,520
and and can actually access that bucket

1568
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,480
so with this fact pattern here

1569
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,680
you know would the ir team

1570
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,920
actually uh violate 1030 by accessing

1571
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,319
this abc bucket i'm going to i'm going

1572
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,319
to pass that how about right back to you

1573
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,319
jay

1574
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,760
okay yeah there i am and and let me say

1575
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,839
at the outset that

1576
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,480
this scenario is not

1577
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,240
a pie in the sky or really contrived

1578
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,960
scenario it's based on an amalgam of a

1579
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,319
couple of incidents that have happened

1580
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,920
very recently

1581
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,359
that actual incidents so yes okay the

1582
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,920
team responds to the alarm

1583
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,400
and is able to trace back and see where

1584
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,880
the data that was exfiltrated when into

1585
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,079
this bucket

1586
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,440
named something

1587
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,079
indicative of ownership by some other

1588
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,040
entity

1589
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,119
can they go into that bucket

1590
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,960
is that

1591
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,799
authorized are they authorized to do so

1592
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,799
to enter someone else's storage bucket

1593
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,040
it's a good question so i guess what

1594
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,280
that hinges on is is this good faith

1595
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,079
security research under the definition

1596
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,319
and when we look back at that definition

1597
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,680
i don't know if we can click back on the

1598
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,040
slide

1599
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,160
um yeah

1600
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,240
look at that the components of what

1601
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,399
constitutes good faith security research

1602
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,280
it says uh accessing a computer solely

1603
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,359
for the purpose of good testing

1604
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,799
investigation

1605
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,799
and or correction of a security floor or

1606
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,160
vulnerability

1607
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,839
where such activities carried out in a

1608
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,079
manner designed to avoid any harm to

1609
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,680
individuals or to the public

1610
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
i think it falls within within that

1611
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,520
definition

1612
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,400
well

1613
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,160
interesting so why don't why don't we

1614
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,599
play out the fact pattern a little bit

1615
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,119
more and then i'll i'll pass it over to

1616
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,280
joel so they get access to the bucket

1617
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,640
and they find

1618
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,040
right they i hope i'm not mixing up my

1619
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,280
hypotheticals here right no yeah and

1620
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,319
let's say they find the data of

1621
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,880
their own organization but together with

1622
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,400
you know let's say 10 other

1623
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,640
organizations as data as well that has

1624
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,400
been exfiltrated in the same

1625
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,000
s3 bucket

1626
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,839
what then do you think

1627
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,480
an ir team an incident response team

1628
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,960
could do i'm looking at you joel here on

1629
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,559
this one

1630
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,960
with their own data and other companies

1631
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,040
is data that was stolen and exfiltrated

1632
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,119
by the same threat actor group so i

1633
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
think it's up to their risk appetite um

1634
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,920
like look

1635
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,000
as as jay alluded to you call these

1636
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,599
hypotheticals but

1637
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,040
this is what's happening in the wild

1638
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
it's his real life this is real life um

1639
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,799
and

1640
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,280
according to my reading of 10 30 it

1641
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,400
seems that

1642
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,160
even breaking into the bad guy's

1643
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,280
computer

1644
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,000
um would constitute a violation

1645
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,400
based on my reading um

1646
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,680
now whether it's something that

1647
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
we would be interested in investigating

1648
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,920
from the fbi standpoint i mean imagine

1649
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,520
imagine a victim comes to us and we're

1650
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,400
like

1651
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,160
hold on you you broke into the hacker's

1652
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,359
computer like

1653
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,839
you're in trouble now you know

1654
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,640
it's just it's an absurdity um i i can't

1655
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,400
imagine a scenario where we would be

1656
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,160
interested in that type of

1657
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,000
that type of thing and

1658
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
according to the new guidance i can't

1659
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,880
imagine

1660
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,799
a situation where anyone would actually

1661
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,520
be prosecuted for something like that

1662
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,640
right but

1663
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,160
as you say joel that comes with some

1664
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,720
risk it does depend upon

1665
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,000
your risk appetite as as an employee or

1666
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,599
an incident responder on behalf of the

1667
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,400
employee

1668
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,040
uh uh behalf of the organization yeah to

1669
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,720
be clear i mean according to my reading

1670
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,160
of the statute it would still be illegal

1671
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,839
i'm not going to advocate

1672
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,319
doing something illegal um

1673
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,839
but these are the types of questions

1674
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,240
that are arising that i don't think

1675
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,839
federal law is

1676
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,280
really equipped

1677
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,000
to give people

1678
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,720
sensible answers to how they can how can

1679
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,520
they respond when

1680
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,200
when

1681
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,640
when affected with this type of

1682
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,680
situation

1683
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,760
yeah just you know get some audience

1684
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,240
participation here by by show of hands

1685
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,680
how many people would think that

1686
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,240
accessing that that bucket

1687
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,280
should be

1688
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,079
a crime

1689
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,079
nobody right so i

1690
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,079
i think you're in good company here joel

1691
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,119
yeah i mean

1692
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,079
it

1693
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,799
sorry what was that

1694
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,119
there were some hands oh there were some

1695
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,720
hands okay sorry i couldn't say that the

1696
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,880
lights are a little bright here right uh

1697
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,200
but that yeah i i think the majority

1698
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,640
would agree with joel here but i want to

1699
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,240
pass it to you sauger for your view on

1700
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,640
this as the actual prosecutor the guy

1701
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,920
who makes these decisions yeah look i i

1702
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,720
hear right i mean i think as joel kind

1703
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,040
of indicated certainly i think just

1704
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,960
accessing the computer

1705
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,079
without kind of doing any again the 10

1706
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,160
30 requires certain actions you have to

1707
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,000
take you have to take information that

1708
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
cause damage you have to cause a loss

1709
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,520
there's all these other things that are

1710
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,559
in addition to simply accessing

1711
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,440
so

1712
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,079
if

1713
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,400
and if you are really doing it in good

1714
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
faith investigation

1715
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,160
and the facts the available evidence

1716
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,880
that i have and that the fbi has to

1717
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,720
you know show that you are in fact

1718
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,480
trying to investigate your own

1719
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,040
data leak you know i think arguably

1720
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,200
would fall uh you know under the good

1721
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,839
faith security research but again

1722
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,839
you know i think it's also helpful to

1723
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:10,799
note that

1724
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,559
this kind of language about good faith

1725
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,839
security research is part of

1726
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,680
eight different factors that are in

1727
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,920
these right guidelines as to things that

1728
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,000
a prosecutor should decide whether or

1729
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,760
not to charge someone

1730
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,599
those other things include

1731
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,280
the impact of the crime and the

1732
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,960
prosecution on the victim in third

1733
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,240
parties here are the victims actually

1734
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,760
doing it the the uh the degree to which

1735
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,359
the damage or access

1736
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,960
uh raises concerns pertaining to

1737
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,319
national security critical

1738
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,240
infrastructure public health

1739
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,240
the sensitivity of the affected computer

1740
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,119
system

1741
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,920
um and the deterrent value of an

1742
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,079
investigation of prosecution right so so

1743
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,920
let's let's complicate it a little bit

1744
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,359
more with this fact

1745
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,559
i think this one's really interesting

1746
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,720
because you you mentioned one of the

1747
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
factors that you think about are the

1748
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,960
impact to third parties so we have 10

1749
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,839
other companies data in this s3 bucket

1750
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,880
the ir team sees this and decides you

1751
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,039
know what i've i've had it with you know

1752
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,880
this threat actor group they've they

1753
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,640
ruined my life i haven't slept in five

1754
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,000
days makes a rash decision and says i'm

1755
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,119
going to delete

1756
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,599
these other archives of exfiltrated data

1757
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,280
that belong to other companies that then

1758
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,359
leads the threat actors to get very

1759
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,480
angry

1760
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,599
and then let's say demand additional

1761
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,200
ransom or

1762
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,880
other or engage in other forms of

1763
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,359
extortion with regard to those other

1764
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,200
affected companies by the threat actor

1765
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,599
so there has been in this situation in

1766
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,079
the new fact pattern here a greater

1767
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,240
impact to third parties after accessing

1768
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,839
that s3 bucket do you think that could

1769
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,480
cross the line

1770
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,079
oh i was going to jump in real quick on

1771
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,920
that alley go ahead jay because i think

1772
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,480
they're really two key decisions first

1773
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,799
okay it's one thing if you see your data

1774
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,480
that's been exfiltrated

1775
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,240
in this bucket that's

1776
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,760
presumably belongs to another

1777
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,160
organization and was likely compromised

1778
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,839
by a bad actor

1779
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,720
so there's one decision about do i do i

1780
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,559
delete the data from my organization

1781
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,880
that i know does not belong there

1782
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,280
and then secondarily i see a bunch of

1783
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,200
other victims there

1784
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,839
should i try in good faith to help them

1785
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,480
and download that data or delete that on

1786
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,039
their behalf can you be sure that it's

1787
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,200
not really supposed to be there

1788
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
um maybe there's some partnership i'm

1789
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,960
not aware of and that data's there for a

1790
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,839
reason so you are taking on some

1791
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,599
additional risk if you do delete the

1792
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,640
data

1793
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,599
and

1794
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,680
i'll i'll tell you to complicate this

1795
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,880
pattern what we'll add is in in the

1796
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,640
instance that led to the creation of

1797
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,119
this scenario that

1798
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,319
while making those decisions

1799
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,280
the the response team had not assured

1800
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,839
that their network was completely secure

1801
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,280
and they were locked down with

1802
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,480
encryption

1803
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,400
when the bad actor determined wow you

1804
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,640
deleted your data

1805
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,960
uh did you think that was our only copy

1806
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,559
of your data the bad actor responded and

1807
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,520
locked down with um drop some encryption

1808
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,880
malware

1809
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,720
you know it it it's

1810
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,319
both you and joel jay had had mentioned

1811
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,799
you know risk here too and i i think it

1812
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,559
it's worth taking a tiny bit of a detour

1813
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,880
about the cfa too because you know it's

1814
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,599
not just a criminal statute there's also

1815
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,760
potential civil liability under the

1816
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
computer fraud and abuse act and as a

1817
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,920
private practice attorney up here now

1818
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,680
that that's you know arguably very

1819
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,839
important because let's say that the ir

1820
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,920
team the incident responders do that and

1821
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,440
it leads to

1822
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,240
additional extortion or or

1823
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,319
a higher ransom demand for these other

1824
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,280
companies

1825
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,359
i think it's quite possible that there

1826
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,760
there could be civil liability under the

1827
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,920
computer fraud and abuse act for that

1828
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,680
particular type of action because it

1829
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,200
resulted in

1830
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,520
some kind of damage or an additional

1831
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,119
cost or extortion to these other

1832
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,359
companies and so there is always this

1833
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,440
civil angle that you have to think about

1834
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,200
in terms of your liability under the

1835
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,359
cfaa or 1030 it's not just a a criminal

1836
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,200
statute but i want to i want to pass it

1837
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,640
back to you sagar because i'm really

1838
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,359
interested in your your uh analysis

1839
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,520
under the more complicated fact pattern

1840
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,359
here yeah i mean look again it's a

1841
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,160
two-step analysis right one is there a

1842
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,920
legally a violation of section 1030 and

1843
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,559
then two you know based on the policies

1844
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,880
and the guidelines and the facts you

1845
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,240
know should

1846
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,640
is this a case that we should charge

1847
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,559
right prosecutorial discretion is a big

1848
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,359
part

1849
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,520
of every prosecutor's job whether we

1850
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,359
should charge a case just just because

1851
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,039
there's a legal violation

1852
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,359
does not mean that we should so here i

1853
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,599
think once they access it and then they

1854
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,599
either obtain they download

1855
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,839
the data even if it's their own data or

1856
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,599
even the data of the other

1857
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,680
firms i think it is

1858
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,960
you know seems appears to be a violation

1859
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,119
of section 1030

1860
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,480
and then the question is should we

1861
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,520
prosecute uh so that will depend on kind

1862
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,480
of

1863
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,240
what was the what were they trying to do

1864
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,400
what was the point you know of what

1865
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,240
their access was what was the harm that

1866
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,880
was caused right um and so that's that's

1867
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,200
a much closer case i mean

1868
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,400
i think my

1869
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,520
you know i think the message that at

1870
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,960
least i want to convey is you know

1871
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,200
before you do that you know

1872
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,440
call law enforcement call us

1873
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,680
uh and we can work with you to figure

1874
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,280
out what's the right step you know what

1875
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,480
i would do

1876
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,920
is if i got that call and i've gotten

1877
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,280
that call before

1878
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,839
uh is you know oh you have the you have

1879
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,680
the keys to get into this

1880
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,319
this hacker's uh you know system

1881
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,319
well let's you know that's great give it

1882
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,559
to us and then i can get a legal process

1883
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,760
of a court that allows us to go

1884
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,319
preserve the evidence take the evidence

1885
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,640
use it for our purposes and going after

1886
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,680
the bad actors uh so you know from our

1887
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,920
perspective if if someone goes in on

1888
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,480
their own they could cause you know they

1889
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,880
could lose the evidence they can cause

1890
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,200
more harm they can which in this hypo it

1891
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,039
actually leads to more harm because

1892
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,599
everyone including the other firm's

1893
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,559
data is encrypted um so you know the

1894
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,640
message is to call us and we can work it

1895
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,799
through and again we are not trying to

1896
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,720
create burdens on victims victims we

1897
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,039
take them very seriously

1898
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,039
um all victims are

1899
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,400
you know confidential we don't want to

1900
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,559
re-victimize you and we want to work

1901
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,480
with you as part of the private public

1902
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,640
partnership to go after these these guys

1903
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,079
it requires kind of all of us sharing

1904
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,920
information to do it

1905
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,799
that's such a great point and

1906
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,359
i think doing it that way would nearly

1907
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,839
eliminate any potential civil liability

1908
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:44,160
that that an ir team or the company for

1909
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,280
which the ir team was working uh could

1910
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,160
face by deleting that data and and

1911
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,000
and causing these these untold

1912
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,839
consequences i mean there i think there

1913
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,240
are a lot of

1914
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,839
unforeseeable consequences to these

1915
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,440
types of actions

1916
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,200
and i want to pass it over to to you

1917
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,799
joel do you want to do would you agree

1918
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,280
with with sauger there that uh you know

1919
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,680
the right action would be reported to

1920
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,119
law enforcement

1921
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,240
and if so how quickly do you think you

1922
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,598
guys could act

1923
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,520
so that's a tough one because we've been

1924
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,600
in situations like that and to be honest

1925
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,839
with you there's a lot of factors

1926
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,520
it depends on whether the servers in the

1927
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,479
united states or whether it's overseas

1928
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,238
and if it is overseas it depends on what

1929
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,040
country it's in um because the answer

1930
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,799
might be you know we have to work with

1931
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,279
law enforcement overseas and you know

1932
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,520
give them the the configuration file or

1933
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,920
the the password to get into the server

1934
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,439
and then when you're talking about

1935
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,520
overseas cooperation in law enforcement

1936
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,439
things really slow down and it becomes

1937
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,080
difficult but i agree with sagar here

1938
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,319
that the right thing to do

1939
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,439
um

1940
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,600
and there shouldn't be any doubt with

1941
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,080
this um if you're concerned about about

1942
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,000
risk and you're concerned about

1943
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,120
breaking

1944
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,960
1030 and you're concerned about civil

1945
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
liability is going to be pulling law

1946
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,719
enforcement into the mix

1947
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,120
spinning us up

1948
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,719
if it's domestic we could probably get a

1949
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,560
search warrant fairly quick quickly we

1950
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,759
would need a search warrant for this

1951
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,198
type of thing we can we can get a

1952
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:14,640
preservation

1953
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,120
faster

1954
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,440
but

1955
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,040
just just to

1956
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,600
talk about the reality of it normally

1957
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,920
when there's a staging server with exfil

1958
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,319
data won't be on there for very long

1959
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,880
we're talking hours

1960
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,759
and so

1961
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,839
we would have to be very lucky and have

1962
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,600
to be very coordinated and work very

1963
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,040
quickly in order to

1964
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,759
be able to take action against it before

1965
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,158
the threat actor moves it or sends it to

1966
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,359
some other server that we don't have

1967
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,279
visibility

1968
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,679
and joel let me add too that of course

1969
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,799
we're not

1970
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,158
we're we're discounting the human

1971
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,480
element too that these are teams that

1972
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,320
have been working for and been up for

1973
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,080
two days

1974
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,159
tracking an incident trying to contain

1975
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,120
it and when they find that data

1976
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
the excitement of it being there and the

1977
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,760
opportunity to delete the data and maybe

1978
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,000
save the day and also perhaps be the

1979
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,080
good guy and try to help some of your

1980
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,640
partners

1981
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,360
that that comes into play when time is

1982
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,719
of the essence and

1983
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,679
it in some cases is easier to

1984
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,159
to make a hurried decision that that

1985
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,000
does and i'm glad you mentioned alex the

1986
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,800
civil

1987
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,640
uh the private cause of action there a

1988
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,280
right of action private right of action

1989
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,199
element of 10 30 because

1990
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:36,239
yeah if those companies incur

1991
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,400
a greater ransom i think they're going

1992
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,080
to respond saying you know a

1993
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,520
notification would have been nice you

1994
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,040
didn't have to go ahead

1995
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
and delete it and put us in the bucket

1996
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,640
with you

1997
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,040
yeah i i tend to agree with you there i

1998
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,360
mean if if i was on the receiving end of

1999
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,080
the ransom demand yeah we'd probably

2000
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,920
start

2001
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,080
sending out the the data preservation

2002
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,679
letters getting and getting the other

2003
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,920
side ready for litigation i mean it's

2004
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,239
it's such a crazy situation and and

2005
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,080
bizarre and complex world that we live

2006
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,800
in here um i think i i want to move on

2007
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,040
to the second hypothetical here if uh if

2008
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,800
everyone agrees yeah you guys good with

2009
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,960
that all right let's do it so let's go

2010
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,040
on to the next one this one i call the

2011
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,040
the diy disaster

2012
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,120
so hypothetical two here

2013
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,520
said let's suppose that there is you

2014
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,480
know god forbid a remote access zero day

2015
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,440
uh discovered on many internet-facing

2016
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,199
devices we don't doesn't matter what

2017
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,719
these devices are they're just they're

2018
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,239
internet facing they're out on public

2019
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,800
ips so there's a working exploit proof

2020
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,520
of concept circulating on twitter

2021
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,679
and there's also been detection of

2022
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,320
increased worldwide scanning for these

2023
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
vulnerable devices looking for things

2024
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,640
that you know can be exploited so here's

2025
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,400
the question here and i'm going to i'm

2026
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,199
going to pose this one to joel first

2027
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,080
could some good faith hacker

2028
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,719
white hat as we would call them

2029
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,360
leverage this exploit to mitigate

2030
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,520
certain vulnerable systems to take

2031
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,239
essentially the the patching of this

2032
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,719
vulnerability into her own hands

2033
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,960
so they they certainly could um i don't

2034
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,400
know if that would be the the best

2035
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,640
course of action um

2036
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,000
a lot of things come into play here

2037
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,159
because the truth is patches break

2038
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,040
things

2039
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,239
and

2040
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,159
if there's production systems that are

2041
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,640
connected to the internet

2042
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,159
um

2043
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,480
if if you patch them and restart them

2044
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,600
things

2045
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,840
could could and will break

2046
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,520
and although

2047
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
and this again we call it a hypothetical

2048
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,640
but this is something that has been

2049
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,239
reported in the wild whenever you have

2050
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,760
these big um

2051
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,320
these big wormable exploits

2052
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,159
inevitably you'll see

2053
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,000
people building worms for monero miners

2054
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,080
you'll see people building worms just as

2055
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,560
you know hello world proofs of concept

2056
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,800
um you'll also see worms going around

2057
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,239
where it's it's

2058
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,360
people

2059
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,520
patching patching the flaw or closing

2060
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,440
ports and trying to mitigate and it's

2061
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,280
just it's pure like

2062
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,960
white hat hackers trying to do the right

2063
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,920
thing and trying to help a stranger

2064
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,360
but there's risk to it there's risk to

2065
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,600
it because there could be some

2066
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,520
inadvertent damage that happens but

2067
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,719
i struggle i struggle with this because

2068
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,400
i also think you know and i like to

2069
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,960
think in analogies and

2070
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,320
if i was having a heart attack i'd want

2071
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,000
someone to give me chest compressions up

2072
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,840
on stage even if they were worried about

2073
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,199
breaking a rib

2074
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,080
um

2075
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,040
so

2076
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,960
like what's worse

2077
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,320
someone patches your system and you have

2078
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,080
some downtime or

2079
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,239
uh you get hit by a

2080
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,880
a ransom a wormable ransom

2081
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,400
and so it's only a matter of time like

2082
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,320
there's going to be a new rdp exploit

2083
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,679
there's going to be a new smb exploit

2084
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,199
there's going to be you know a microsoft

2085
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,280
exchange exploit that's going to be

2086
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,880
warmable and

2087
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,040
there's going to be a countdown to

2088
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,719
um when it gets ported into say

2089
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,560
metasploit or when when someone is able

2090
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,600
to

2091
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,520
to take code from github and build

2092
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,600
something that will just spread like

2093
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,800
wildfire

2094
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,679
and

2095
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,199
um

2096
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,520
yeah it's it's it's difficult i wouldn't

2097
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,159
do it i wouldn't do it but

2098
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,760
people will do it and they have done it

2099
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,960
they have the people have taken into

2100
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,960
their house i think you know it really

2101
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,320
goes back to what you were saying

2102
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,159
earlier sauger which is i think you know

2103
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,080
it's about intent and here

2104
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,679
if you go and take patching of

2105
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,360
vulnerability into your own hands there

2106
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,600
are foreseeable but arguably

2107
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,239
unintentional consequences of what you'd

2108
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,000
be doing but you know some of those

2109
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,679
unintentional consequences for example

2110
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,600
could could affect the hospital right

2111
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,080
you know hospitals are notorious for

2112
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,440
relying on uh older hardware that has

2113
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,199
firmware on it that hasn't been updated

2114
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,600
since you know dos 5.1 right and you

2115
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,600
start monkeying around with those types

2116
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,760
of systems things might go down patients

2117
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,520
might not get care people might die i

2118
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,920
mean it's all hypothetical of course but

2119
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,440
these are some of the unintentional

2120
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,440
consequences that that could happen and

2121
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,640
i and i think your your cpr analogy is

2122
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,920
really apt as well but but i think it i

2123
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,120
think it might depend on the risk for

2124
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,040
both sides perhaps i want to i want to

2125
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,960
pass it over to you saga yeah no i think

2126
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,600
that's that's right you know is this

2127
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,040
again going to kind of the two-step

2128
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,040
analysis right is this a

2129
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,080
violation of section 1030 appears to be

2130
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,760
you know you're accessing someone else's

2131
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,120
computer and you're

2132
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,600
uh you know transmitting a command or

2133
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,440
code to do something um and it could it

2134
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,520
changes the system right so i think

2135
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,679
technically it is it is appears to be a

2136
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,040
violation

2137
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,719
you know but then the second question is

2138
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,159
you know again looking at the policies

2139
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,400
and looking you know is this is this

2140
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,480
good faith security research is this

2141
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,400
someone who had

2142
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,280
no intent to harm you know i i'm not

2143
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,280
sure kind of you have to look at the

2144
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,640
facts also we'll have to look at the

2145
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,760
harm that was caused we'll have to

2146
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,000
consult with the victim of that harm and

2147
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,080
you know we do take victims rights kind

2148
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,239
of very seriously but i think

2149
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,400
the real question is you know what when

2150
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,560
they decided to put the patch on you

2151
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,360
know what efforts did they take to avoid

2152
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,360
harm were there other things they could

2153
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,600
have done yeah to avoid harm and that's

2154
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,040
right from the guidelines isn't that

2155
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,120
right yeah yeah that that's interesting

2156
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,679
joel i'm sorry not joel uh jay there's

2157
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,080
too many j's here yeah jay what what

2158
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,320
about you i would love to get your your

2159
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,719
thoughts on this one

2160
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,800
uh yeah i

2161
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,000
i'm listening to the comments and and

2162
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,760
i

2163
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,520
i think this is uncharted territory

2164
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,760
really i mean the

2165
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,920
the

2166
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,159
the the landscape is so complicated and

2167
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:35,679
those dependencies i think joel you

2168
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,719
refer to it are there's no way that even

2169
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,800
the most well-intentioned

2170
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,440
uh uh individual could

2171
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,080
could understand the potential harm that

2172
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,440
could be visited

2173
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,040
by

2174
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,199
pushing out a hurried patch that hasn't

2175
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,840
been tested and validated

2176
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,600
that

2177
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,560
causes significant and

2178
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,120
great unintended harm so

2179
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,199
yes uh i think what

2180
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,600
one of the potential solutions is here

2181
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,120
is to speed

2182
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,199
the coalitions through which we share

2183
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,239
those

2184
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,600
solutions

2185
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,719
so that

2186
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:13,440
more

2187
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,199
fertile minds can come together more

2188
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,840
quickly to evaluate

2189
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,760
the potential solutions instead of the

2190
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,679
rush to a solution

2191
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,080
when the problem may not be entirely

2192
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,880
known at that point a few minutes of

2193
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,960
focus on the problem to make sure that

2194
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,640
the solutions appropriate

2195
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,480
would help

2196
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,880
yeah yep i i tend to agree with you

2197
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,280
there jay and um

2198
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,040
you know i also i want to thank

2199
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,320
everybody for

2200
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,560
listening to us for this extended period

2201
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,880
of time here and because

2202
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,199
our uh the panelists that were in our

2203
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,199
slot had cancelled we've been able to

2204
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,040
extend this session and also want to

2205
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,280
open it up to q a at this point

2206
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,719
um

2207
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,080
it's a little bit hard to see with the

2208
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,480
lights but we'd love to to answer

2209
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,000
questions from the audience here and i

2210
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,600
think there's one in the front i don't

2211
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,120
know if we're using microphones or if

2212
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,440
there's a mic in the back is that

2213
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,840
how's this thing working here

2214
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,040
oh there's a mic in the back all right

2215
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,320
so how about

2216
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,239
yeah if you want to line up and ask

2217
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,759
questions that would be great

2218
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,840
you guys all good for time here do do a

2219
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,080
couple of questions and uh yeah

2220
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,280
fantastic sure appreciate that excellent

2221
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,480
um

2222
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,400
sir sir and the red

2223
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,800
thank you sir uh thank you everybody um

2224
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,760
so

2225
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,960
good uh

2226
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,800
thanks for asking about aaron schwartz

2227
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,120
um who of course would be alive if not

2228
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,159
for the actions of people the doj

2229
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,199
and prosecuting him under this act

2230
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,320
and

2231
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,360
it's not the only time in history when

2232
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,280
prosecutors were

2233
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,920
too lacking in empathy for somebody who

2234
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,159
acted in the public interest

2235
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,440
i

2236
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,120
do think this guideline is these

2237
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,880
guidelines are better than nothing but

2238
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,640
doj is not powerless here

2239
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,760
the doj has influence over the law

2240
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,480
we all know that 2001 the department of

2241
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,960
justice said we'd like these things

2242
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,640
passed and congress went ahead and put

2243
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,400
them into the patriot act

2244
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,280
so doj can't go to congress and say we

2245
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,840
want to change the cfaa

2246
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,880
and

2247
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,280
i don't understand why a lot of laws

2248
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,360
don't have more public interest defenses

2249
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,840
but the cfaa in particular

2250
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,360
doj could go to congress say we want to

2251
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,520
you to add a public interest defense to

2252
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,239
the cfaa so that

2253
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,520
somebody

2254
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,159
who releases information in the public

2255
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,199
interest

2256
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,520
that does not violate privacy that

2257
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,880
doesn't have its

2258
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,960
primary use being for the purpose of an

2259
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,719
ethical business

2260
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,199
is not going to get prosecuted and

2261
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,760
that's going to outlast not just

2262
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,960
it's going to outlast the current

2263
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,400
administration it's going to be a

2264
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,480
permanent improvement in the law

2265
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,120
can you give any good reason why doj

2266
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,520
does not do this

2267
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,760
and just to be clear here you're asking

2268
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,920
about essentially a lobbying question

2269
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,120
here right why why is doj not

2270
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,960
pressuring congress to change the law

2271
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,560
you call it lobbying if you like but

2272
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,159
it's a lot it's more intimate than

2273
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,480
lobbying um the dog is more intimate

2274
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,400
than a lot of lobbying doj does

2275
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,719
regularly go to congress saying we want

2276
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,800
uh more draconian laws or we want

2277
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,639
changes in the law why can't they just

2278
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,639
say we think this law would be improved

2279
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,600
by allowing uh a this for the following

2280
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,320
specific public interest defense

2281
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,080
i'll pass it to sagar if you want to

2282
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,080
comment look i i don't think i can speak

2283
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,440
to that uh in my position all i can say

2284
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,600
is that you know oftentimes i'm aware

2285
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,520
that you know

2286
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,920
i'm not sure whether we lobby for

2287
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,840
legislation i know that congress

2288
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,760
regularly inquires what when there's

2289
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,600
proposed legislation what the impact of

2290
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,320
that might be and you know i think we

2291
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,560
have individuals that go and testify in

2292
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,159
front of congressional hearings as to

2293
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,239
the impact of legislation on the work

2294
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,760
that we do every day

2295
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,000
um but other than that i don't think i

2296
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,760
haven't the answer to your question yeah

2297
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,960
i'm just asking is there any reason why

2298
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,560
doj should not do that any ethical

2299
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,480
reason why you should not do that

2300
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,159
well i i could

2301
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,320
possibly make one comment in response

2302
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,360
which is

2303
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,040
you you would only really want to have

2304
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,040
you know as a lawyer here's i'm speaking

2305
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,360
him privately not on behalf of my firm

2306
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,040
either but i think as a as a as a lawyer

2307
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,800
you would want to have changes in the

2308
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
law that would be necessary

2309
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,639
and i think that

2310
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,639
to have congress act while the supreme

2311
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,719
court was still changing and evolving

2312
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,199
the law as it was very active and doing

2313
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,679
might be a little bit premature and i i

2314
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:44,800
tend to see

2315
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,280
the evolution of the supreme court's

2316
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,639
interpretation

2317
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,159
of the computer fraud and abuse act and

2318
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,920
10 30 in particular

2319
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,679
as continue as a continuous narrowing of

2320
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,760
what would constitute a crime under that

2321
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,560
statute and so arguably there wouldn't

2322
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,520
be the need to go to congress from doj's

2323
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,600
perspective to do this and i would see

2324
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
the guidelines as you admitted i think

2325
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,840
as a good first step here

2326
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,639
but look i agree and as we addressed in

2327
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,400
the panel it does the guidelines don't

2328
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,159
change the law the law is what the law

2329
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,880
is right and i think it's quite

2330
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,880
reasonable to expect that there may be

2331
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,199
other prosecutors in doj that might not

2332
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,440
be as enlightened as sauger

2333
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,520
and might have differing interpretations

2334
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,360
and the way to prevent that would be to

2335
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,280
actually change the law

2336
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,000
so i i take your point and

2337
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
you know i think it's an interesting one

2338
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,679
and uh yeah we'd love to move on to

2339
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:38,880
another question if that's all right

2340
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,440
well let me add quickly alex that i i

2341
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,239
think

2342
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,800
yeah yeah i mean uh the

2343
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,480
the person asking the question alluded

2344
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,679
to it as

2345
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,679
a first step and and i think we have to

2346
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,280
recognize that

2347
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,360
we're in the midst of an evolution here

2348
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,679
it may be a little hard to see because

2349
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,000
it's happening around us but the supreme

2350
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,280
court decision

2351
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,080
this necessary first step and and also

2352
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,679
the evolution of

2353
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,080
kind of the space that i'm in every day

2354
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,400
a public-private partnership where

2355
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,639
members of the law enforcement community

2356
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,040
are working shoulder to shoulder with

2357
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,920
security researchers threat hunters

2358
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,400
members of academia you know as those

2359
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,320
efforts bear fruit and continue to

2360
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,840
evolve

2361
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,440
if there's

2362
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,960
if there is a a calculable or an

2363
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,639
articulable

2364
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,639
need to say you know we could take it to

2365
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,080
the next level

2366
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,360
but our security researchers are still

2367
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,920
um concerned or the law departments are

2368
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,080
haven't responded to

2369
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,800
to this policy change and we're still

2370
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,520
hearing no no no you can't do this

2371
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,719
uh

2372
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,880
that that's when i think the data call

2373
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,320
will go around

2374
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,360
for

2375
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,360
uh friends uh

2376
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,159
amicus uh letters and briefs will come

2377
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,360
in um and the department of justice may

2378
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,639
and i certainly don't speak for the

2379
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,560
department of justice but

2380
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,080
i know that there's a data call that

2381
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,440
goes around every year to all the

2382
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,760
agencies to ask what do you need to do

2383
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,920
your job more effectively and if folks

2384
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,920
like the fbi and dhs hsi and

2385
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:14,800
uh

2386
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,840
secret service say we need more input

2387
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,679
and we think that that

2388
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,000
uh a change in the law is absolutely

2389
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,320
what's chilling folks from coming

2390
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,400
forward that's what's going to prompt

2391
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,920
congress to

2392
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,679
to to lean forward and and deal with

2393
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,400
constituent concerns which are

2394
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,639
they're over indexed on frankly but

2395
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,560
that's um

2396
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,360
i i think it it takes time and we're

2397
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,159
walking before we can jog jogger run

2398
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,760
well you're describing a process that's

2399
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,080
uh that's well adapted to widening

2400
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,679
predicates but not to narrowing

2401
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,440
predicates and if the supreme court

2402
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,520
narrows things in one way that does not

2403
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,600
mean that all the ways in which the law

2404
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,040
needs to be narrowed need to be

2405
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
addressed that's an area where crafting

2406
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,880
legislation is important we all know the

2407
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,480
supreme court doesn't do a lot of the

2408
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,639
narrowing that's needed so

2409
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,480
that's why i think i'm asking is there

2410
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,120
ethical any ethical reason why doj

2411
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,480
should not

2412
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,320
go to congress and go in a narrowing

2413
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,600
direction even though that's not what

2414
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,000
they're used to doing

2415
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,760
well we appreciate your comments and and

2416
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,639
your question thank you

2417
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:22,960
hello

2418
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,960
um yeah i was just wondering like for

2419
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,800
the hypothetical situations like how

2420
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,840
would that

2421
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,920
end up like in a situation where it's

2422
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,600
in front of the doj in the first place

2423
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,880
like abc org is not gonna go

2424
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
this person i'm hacking has hacked my

2425
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,840
computer back

2426
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,120
do you want to take that saga or joel

2427
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,320
i mean that

2428
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,599
that's a good common sense

2429
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,320
data point right it's you know usually

2430
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,880
it's not going to come to fruition that

2431
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,040
i'm even necessarily going to learn

2432
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,880
that abc corp was hacked right of course

2433
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,520
however in that hypothetical if

2434
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,920
it leads to the encryption keys getting

2435
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,120
out and

2436
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,440
several other companies data getting

2437
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,560
locked up

2438
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,080
then it's something that might come to

2439
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,639
our attention so that i think working

2440
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,120
within the hypo that that's how we might

2441
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,480
learn about it

2442
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,400
yeah and i'll add i i think it would

2443
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,840
take some time for there to be a

2444
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,760
for there to be a disclosure or an

2445
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,000
understanding of what really happened

2446
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,320
as the company gets past the incident

2447
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,199
and rebuilds its network or or pays the

2448
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:36,480
ransom and gets the decryption key

2449
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,159
there's often litigation by third

2450
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,760
parties that were impacted by the

2451
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,280
outages saying company

2452
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,280
a professional services company you know

2453
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,800
you didn't do enough you didn't prepare

2454
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,719
enough your system wasn't secure enough

2455
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,719
and i've been damaged in some way and

2456
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,560
then in the wash

2457
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,320
through discovery or otherwise it'll

2458
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,880
come out that this is what happened we

2459
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,800
we learned we did our best we tried to

2460
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,159
delete the data

2461
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,639
and and there could be some disclosure

2462
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:03,600
that

2463
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,199
that the company took some action that

2464
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,199
impacted others but you're right would

2465
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,679
they volunteer that to say up or bad we

2466
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,040
met well but

2467
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,360
we were trying to save you and we caused

2468
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,440
you a little more harm

2469
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,960
it wouldn't be immediately apparent to

2470
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,120
those other companies

2471
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,400
thank you great thank you

2472
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,840
thank you very much my question is in

2473
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,760
regards to bug bounties and like a

2474
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,600
security researcher finding a bug they

2475
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,199
do the proper thing they alert the

2476
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,440
organization and they wait the 90 days

2477
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,280
and in the careful reading here

2478
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,199
indicates that if the company doesn't

2479
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,120
reply to that and doesn't take any

2480
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,120
action that there's still no cover for

2481
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,040
that security researcher to do a public

2482
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,679
disclosure if that disclosure was to it

2483
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,440
was to create some type of financial

2484
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,440
harm as i as

2485
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,760
at least that's the way i read that

2486
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,320
is that correct

2487
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,440
anybody want to take this one on so

2488
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,600
responsible disclosure

2489
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,920
it's not codified into law it's more of

2490
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,800
like ethical um frameworks that some

2491
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,639
people have proposed uh you know what's

2492
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,320
the waiting period for a company when

2493
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,840
you make ethical disclosure is it 90

2494
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,679
days is it one day is it three months um

2495
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,320
i've seen some some different you know

2496
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,480
takes on what's what the right thing to

2497
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,840
do is in that type of situation um

2498
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,400
and i think i think a lot of it depends

2499
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,239
i think a lot of it depends you know

2500
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,440
it's hard for

2501
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,600
a large enterprise to patch their system

2502
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,400
quickly

2503
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,080
and so i think it would be unfair if

2504
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,440
someone identifies a bug in a

2505
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,480
company's

2506
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,480
network and then says in three days i'm

2507
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,480
going to the press

2508
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,320
yeah i think i was trying to clarify

2509
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,480
like that the actual the new standards

2510
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,239
that say as long as you're trying not to

2511
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,719
harm them you're okay but at what point

2512
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,280
you know does that break

2513
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,199
i don't know yeah

2514
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,880
i don't know i mean it's something that

2515
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,480
time is gonna have to bear out because

2516
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,679
you're gonna have these situations in

2517
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,600
the future um

2518
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,280
one thing i i will point to um

2519
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,800
so there's a lot of situations where um

2520
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,320
someone will go through the motions for

2521
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,719
responsible disclosure and then

2522
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,320
they'll

2523
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,840
they'll go to the press because they

2524
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,600
want they want notoriety for finding a

2525
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,000
bug um and

2526
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
their motivation is they

2527
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,440
they want their name in the newspaper

2528
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,440
and they want to shame the the

2529
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,120
enterprise or

2530
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,320
i shouldn't say that's their motivation

2531
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,760
but that's kind of like what comes out

2532
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,719
of it

2533
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,960
what i would prefer is uh

2534
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,800
to make the ethical

2535
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,760
uh notification and then to uh present

2536
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,840
at hope conference and talk about this

2537
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,320
really cool exploit that you found

2538
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,400
without you know showing any of the

2539
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,679
private data

2540
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,120
to anyone you know redact we need to

2541
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,679
redact but talk about um the technical

2542
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,920
steps that you found or that you used to

2543
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,239
define the bug and and the timeline of

2544
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,920
when you disclosed and what the company

2545
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,440
did i think that's more interesting than

2546
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,080
someone going to a reporter and saying

2547
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:56,960
uh

2548
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,320
like hey you should

2549
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,760
report this

2550
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,880
thank you very much

2551
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,320
one other point to i think to your

2552
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,920
interesting question too

2553
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,719
and i'd ask really you know sauger this

2554
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,080
is really more of a question to you i

2555
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,600
guess but you know whether it's

2556
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,080
responsible disclosure or irresponsible

2557
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,199
disclosure and you're putting that

2558
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,480
information out into whatever the

2559
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,080
ecosystem is

2560
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,480
that is a lot different from the type of

2561
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,360
affirmative activity that would equate

2562
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,400
to

2563
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,120
unauthorized access itself under the

2564
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,000
statute right so talking about something

2565
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,760
putting information out there would not

2566
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,679
necessarily lead to some kind of

2567
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,840
actionable charge as i understand it

2568
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,679
under the under 1030 or cfaa

2569
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,440
would that be correct i think that's

2570
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,280
generally right yeah i would say it

2571
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,199
probably depends on like some of the

2572
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,120
specific scenarios like for instance if

2573
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,840
you find a bug on

2574
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,840
someone's external facing sql database

2575
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,679
and then you you spend a month

2576
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,120
downloading every single thing on their

2577
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,159
database

2578
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,120
um

2579
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,159
like that's where it gets into that

2580
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,920
blurred area of like well

2581
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,280
why'd you have to do that like you had

2582
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,800
the proof of concept you showed that it

2583
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,480
was that it worked why did you have to

2584
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,840
pull the rest of the data from the

2585
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,239
company um so there are some gray areas

2586
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,600
that you get into and it's it's really

2587
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,120
fact dependent

2588
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,920
yeah and joel 2 right

2589
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,600
some of those those uh requests to

2590
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,440
to apply for a

2591
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,080
bounty that may be available or are no

2592
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,480
more than thinly veiled extortion

2593
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,560
requests

2594
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,040
and yeah sometimes the activity is not

2595
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:27,840
with

2596
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,080
good faith that it's conducted it's

2597
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,880
conducted in bad faith with

2598
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,960
um efforts to

2599
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,120
to cause some harm and

2600
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,920
to

2601
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,199
to agree to hide um

2602
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,840
the damage or or to stop the damage uh

2603
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,480
in exchange for some money so

2604
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,320
the facts are important in each one of

2605
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
those

2606
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,679
well thank you very much thank you

2607
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,199
thanks for your question great shirt by

2608
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,159
the way

2609
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,040
love it

2610
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,960
hi and thank you i thought i wanted to

2611
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,719
post a hypothetical in a different

2612
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,639
direction if that's all right

2613
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,920
so so imagine this scenario an employee

2614
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,080
at the company working at the company

2615
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,000
normally and with access to the company

2616
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,639
networks however due to a bug that they

2617
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,880
were not looking for they obtain access

2618
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,760
to

2619
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,000
documents they were not looking for that

2620
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,880
they are not supposed to have access for

2621
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,280
the using this they see that the company

2622
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,440
has conducted activity that is deeply

2623
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,360
and as a code though not necessarily

2624
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,400
illegal

2625
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,239
in the higher levels and they give this

2626
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,000
to a reporter

2627
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,400
the company argues that this employee

2628
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,120
used unauthorized access to obtain

2629
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,480
information that was deeply damaging to

2630
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,639
themselves regardless of the veracity

2631
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:41,600
and

2632
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,560
ethicality of it so like as a prosecutor

2633
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,920
how would how would you pursue this and

2634
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,199
what do you think others that i mean the

2635
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:52,800
prosecutorial realm in general would do

2636
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,639
can i ask you one clarifying question

2637
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,719
and you're hypothetical there too would

2638
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,199
be so because it was a little bit hard

2639
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,400
to hear and you might have touched on

2640
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,440
this but

2641
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,440
in your hypothetical where this employee

2642
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,840
then goes and accesses certain data that

2643
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,440
indicates the company has been doing

2644
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,080
some untoward things yeah did the

2645
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,199
employee

2646
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,520
actually have the access to that

2647
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,600
particular document or did the employee

2648
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,520
have to get through some kind of barrier

2649
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,520
in order to get the documents

2650
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,360
let's say that the imp

2651
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,840
that there was a bike in the system so

2652
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,800
that the employee

2653
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,719
there was some way for the employee to

2654
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,400
get that information even though they

2655
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,960
were not supposed to perhaps using some

2656
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,280
different maps perhaps

2657
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,960
would it let's say in your hypothetical

2658
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,760
would have would it work that if the

2659
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,920
access the employee was granted by the

2660
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,320
company was incorrectly configured to

2661
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,159
have given them more access to a

2662
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,840
particular document would that fit your

2663
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,960
hypothetical yes if say the access in

2664
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,040
one certain obscure case were

2665
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,120
incorrectly configured so okay

2666
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,920
great i'll pass it over to you guys

2667
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,199
yeah that that's an interesting

2668
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:02,159
hypothetical i think of the

2669
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,400
related hypothetical which is you know

2670
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,000
you're always wondering what your bosses

2671
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,440
are thinking of you

2672
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,239
and

2673
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,159
so then but on your computer system

2674
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,920
somehow when you're clicking through

2675
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,920
kind of various folders the folder that

2676
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,679
you always thought you never had access

2677
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,440
to all of a sudden you click on it and

2678
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,360
it's available to you and it shows all

2679
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,800
the notes that your bosses have been

2680
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,480
keeping in your file it's a trap

2681
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:25,440
so

2682
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,520
if it's not the boss is saying if you're

2683
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,040
going to access it

2684
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,800
you know is that a violation i you know

2685
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,800
it's it's a good question

2686
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,679
um

2687
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,199
i think it's gonna be hard to prosecute

2688
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,679
that case yeah i i think under the

2689
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,080
supreme court's decision because

2690
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,040
um the supreme court kind of spoke of

2691
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,400
you know you have to

2692
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,080
it is something that you are blocked

2693
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,520
from by some sort of technological means

2694
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,159
and if you if they mess up and

2695
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,040
due to no part no action on your part

2696
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,960
you have access to it i think it's going

2697
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,119
to be a hard case so when we think about

2698
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,800
the two-step analysis you know is that a

2699
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,840
case that

2700
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,119
we should

2701
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,960
we can prosecute

2702
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,719
i think it's gonna be hard to yeah now

2703
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,719
let's change our colleagues hypothetical

2704
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,400
here for a second where the access

2705
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,320
wasn't incorrectly configured but let's

2706
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,440
say it's a

2707
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,920
folder that had uh was password

2708
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,760
protected and somebody brute forced the

2709
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,760
password that would be a little bit more

2710
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,239
clear-cut as a violation i agree yeah

2711
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,480
yeah and now alex let me jump in here

2712
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,400
because this is really interesting in

2713
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,600
that

2714
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,480
uh

2715
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,679
at the fbi and joel you jump in here too

2716
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,280
there are many times where someone will

2717
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,560
report

2718
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,800
some information of concern

2719
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,480
and the means through which they

2720
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,760
gathered

2721
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,520
that information are arguably illegal

2722
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,119
that doesn't preclude the government

2723
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:46,960
from taking that information now

2724
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,440
conversely if the person said i can get

2725
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,760
it through this means i could easily

2726
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,600
brute force that and crack it you

2727
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,320
couldn't say go do that because then

2728
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,159
they'd be an extension a government

2729
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,800
agent and that would violate the law but

2730
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,639
if they had done it and reported it

2731
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,400
that's an option that they could report

2732
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,920
it

2733
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,360
and let

2734
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,840
the government

2735
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,719
um do what he can to mitigate the harm

2736
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,800
from that so again the facts are going

2737
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,960
to be important is it strictly unethical

2738
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,639
behavior or is it something that could

2739
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,040
be damaging and

2740
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,400
worse

2741
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,320
okay i thank you for that jay and thank

2742
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,080
you for the the great question we i

2743
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,239
think we're probably only able to take

2744
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,840
one more question how many people do we

2745
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,159
have left there is it just two

2746
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,638
is it two

2747
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:36,840
all

2748
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,000
right we go hi sorry i'm gus andrews for

2749
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,520
the moment i'm putting on my work cat

2750
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,840
i'm with disarm foundation

2751
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,880
i have a question that's a little bit

2752
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,239
tangential to what we've been talking

2753
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,639
about and that is

2754
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,639
from where each of you stands

2755
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,119
we talked about with that last case um

2756
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,880
where it was like you could just release

2757
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,119
a patch and i'm sure everybody's um you

2758
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,000
know

2759
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,440
release and development managers would

2760
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,119
really prefer you not do that so it's

2761
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:02,719
not just the law would prefer you not do

2762
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,320
it but the you know the engineers would

2763
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,199
too

2764
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,719
um you said that maybe it sounds like

2765
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,159
maybe what was preferential what you

2766
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,520
prefer to see in that case is people

2767
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,440
communicating with each other and saying

2768
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,119
hey you know this is what we're seeing

2769
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,199
um you know can everybody jump on this

2770
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:18,080
from where each of you stand

2771
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,960
what are the things that would be most

2772
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,679
important to improve trust between

2773
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:25,280
organizations communicating about things

2774
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,560
like that

2775
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,360
and to improve communication between

2776
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,639
organizations

2777
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,880
and entities around that

2778
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,719
this sounds like one for jay and joel

2779
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,320
here

2780
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,119
yeah

2781
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,159
uh

2782
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,159
let me start here because uh as we

2783
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,840
mentioned at the outset i i spent a long

2784
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,880
career in government and then

2785
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,119
represented clients and had a number of

2786
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,639
stops in this journey and now i'm back

2787
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,480
in the space where

2788
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,639
i i see every day

2789
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,320
what it takes to build those trust

2790
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,119
relationships between

2791
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,719
law enforcement agencies that maybe

2792
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,560
haven't worked together as closely as

2793
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,840
they should and then also private sector

2794
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,440
partners and um

2795
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,600
i i wish there was an easy answer to

2796
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,520
that i i think it

2797
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,000
uh the landscape is changing in that i

2798
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,920
think there are people who are committed

2799
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,679
to doing the work

2800
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:14,800
and

2801
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,960
uh um

2802
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,840
being more open in environments like

2803
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,080
ours at ncfta and others

2804
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,080
but it does require a very purposeful

2805
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:27,119
effort to engage i mean you can't

2806
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,280
sit back in your office

2807
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,119
or your home office or wherever you work

2808
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,520
from and expect that you're going to be

2809
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,360
able to build

2810
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,119
the the trust relationships that are

2811
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,719
necessary when you need to call on

2812
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,360
someone to pick you up or to collaborate

2813
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,920
with you on something really important

2814
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,040
so

2815
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,400
i i think it it requires

2816
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,560
an effort to brief your leadership and

2817
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,400
your organization to express the

2818
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,360
importance of getting out and listening

2819
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,520
going on a listening tour and working

2820
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,880
with others to define problems before

2821
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,960
uh solutions of rush to

2822
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,840
it's there's no easy path it requires a

2823
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,320
lot of work and i urge the folks that

2824
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,960
are out there to think about ways and

2825
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,040
out in the audience that is to

2826
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,760
opportunities to meet with others that

2827
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,119
may be a little bit of a stretch you

2828
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,639
know a little outside your comfort zone

2829
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:21,520
and and in your ordinary circle just to

2830
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,920
hear what they're working on and develop

2831
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,960
those

2832
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,239
those connections that i think help when

2833
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,840
those important and harder decisions

2834
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,520
come down the road because you have

2835
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,840
those built-in relationships that

2836
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,159
that that can serve you well

2837
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:38,880
yeah and you know jay i think is a great

2838
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
comment and and allows us to kind of

2839
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,880
segue into into wrapping it up here too

2840
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,320
and um

2841
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,480
you know i i'm i'm

2842
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,159
reminded of um ambassador ido aharoni

2843
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,600
who was the longest serving consul

2844
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,080
general general of israel made a comment

2845
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,119
to me about cyber security and and uh

2846
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:59,199
and and foreign diplomacy and saying

2847
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,320
that um

2848
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,880
you know the the reason why countries

2849
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,880
have embassies all around the world the

2850
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,400
reason why united states has an embassy

2851
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,119
in uganda and tanzania as well as paris

2852
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,199
and russia's is is not because you know

2853
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:12,480
we'd like to collect real estate in

2854
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,239
foreign countries it's because you know

2855
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,679
we're building these bridges and have

2856
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,840
these relationships in place in case we

2857
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,000
need them and we may be able to do in

2858
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,320
and that in the cyber security sphere we

2859
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,480
need to build those those same types of

2860
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,239
relationships and i think

2861
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,119
you know it's very obvious to us all

2862
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,719
right now that we live in really

2863
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,119
complicated and complex times and we

2864
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,000
dwell

2865
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,040
permanently in an area of nuance and and

2866
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,639
greyness and

2867
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,679
as as i think jay and joel and sagar all

2868
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,880
alluded to earlier you know we cannot go

2869
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,000
it alone at all anymore no party is

2870
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
equipped to deal with the complexities

2871
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,239
of this world just by itself i think the

2872
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:54,000
guidelines these new prosecutorial

2873
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,760
guidelines with the cfaa

2874
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,000
really should go a long way into into

2875
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,360
fostering this public-private

2876
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,880
partnership

2877
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,360
and and this the hypothetical private

2878
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,119
alliance i think that is not just

2879
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:07,119
hypothetical anymore and something that

2880
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,480
that jay

2881
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,280
cramer is actively working to forge on a

2882
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,360
daily basis and and i want to pass it

2883
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,159
over

2884
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,560
for a moment before we conclude to to

2885
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,880
sauger to make um essentially a couple

2886
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,800
of statements and and maybe even a plea

2887
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,800
to the community here yeah look uh you

2888
