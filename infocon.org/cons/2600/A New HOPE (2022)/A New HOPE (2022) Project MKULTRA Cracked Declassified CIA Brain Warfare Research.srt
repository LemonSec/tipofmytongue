this is a reminder folks please make

11
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,380

part

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,200
on to our next talk

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,460
there's actually an interesting

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,860
connection to the old hotel

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,200
from this talk

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,939
if you're like if you're if you didn't

19

know this

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,820
um MK Ultra has an interesting

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,820
connection with the hotel Pennsylvania

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,920
Frank Olson one of the whistleblowers

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,820
there

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,400
was suicided from room 1018a of that

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
hotel

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
and to talk more about MK Ultra we have

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780
our next speakers Josh palton and

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,750
Atlanta clamp

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,730
[Applause]

30
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,520
great thank you guys so much

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,420
what up hope where's the manual at

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,100
not here

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,560
thank you so much for having me we came

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,380
all the way from Vancouver BC Canada to

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,080
share this extra special presentation on

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
MK Ultra if you have been on any dark

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
rabbit holes on the internet you will

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,900
have heard of MK Ultra and today we're

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
going to look at what is the real MK

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,040
Ultra versus what is the mythology

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,920
that's been created around it

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,579
great

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,440
so my name is peon and as a peon I'm

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,680
just a lowly figure but just look at

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,480
what can be accomplished with open

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,519
source intelligence none of the

47
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,099
information providing this talk has used

48
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,800
any classified or top secret information

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,500
it's just making sense of the whole data

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,640
of the MK Ultra picture

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,239
so the mythology around MK Ultra has put

52
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
it at the top of Lisa Simpson's reasons

53
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,599
why she doesn't trust the government and

54
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,400
there must be some good reasons around

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,959
that if it's on her top of her list

56
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,680
the mythology around MK Ultra is based

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,400
on the idea of trauma-based mind control

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,080
and there are a lot of people on the

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,060
internet who talk about trauma-based

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,519
mind control and being a programmed

61
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,120
assassin or a sleeper agent what we call

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,900
a Manchurian Candidate the mythology has

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,239
taken off that MK Ultra was about

64
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,480
producing Manchurian candidates but

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,060
we're going to go into a deep dive into

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,299
the MK Ultra proper what was

67
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,720
uh the Base

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,540
projects were research grants that

69
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,120
sponsored investigators and researchers

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,060
and phds at universities and colleges

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,540
and other institutions

72
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,540
so we'll review the whole MK Ultra

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,360
picture of all the sub-projects and see

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,040
if it compares to The Manchurian

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,799
Candidate idea of it

76
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,700
um another idea of MK Ultra if you ask a

77
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,120
pothead is there's a type of cannabis

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
that's named after M kildra and that is

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,300
actually an ounce of it right there on

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,520
the cabinet and he's licking his lips

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,580
because it's good stuff apparently but

82
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,060
people would uh like to be MK Ultra it

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,880
seems if you're smoking

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,680
um

85
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,340
so

86
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,440
um

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,820
in the 1950s the CIA CIA director Alan

88
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Dulles spoke at Stanford University and

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,860
there were rumors going around that the

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,080
Russians or the Chinese were

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,259
brainwashing prisoners of war and when

92
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,060
our boys were coming back they were

93
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,300
exposing Devotion to Communism and other

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,759
ideas and the CIA and intelligence World

95
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,580
wondered how was this possible that our

96
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,039
boys would flip by being captured and

97
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,440
what were they doing so the director

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,680
spoke about the New Concept of brain

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,860
Warfare and he said in his speech its

100
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,259
aim is to condition the mind so that it

101
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,900
no longer reacts on a free will or

102
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
rational basis but responds to impulses

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,020
implanted from outside so their idea was

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,060
you could create a situation an

105
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,580
environment or a type of drug or some

106
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,100
sort of a way to get into under

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,259
someone's culture or other back door

108
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,180
into someone's head that they could

109
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,060
program the conscious find to get them

110
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,979
to do what they want them to do or

111
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,100
believe what they want them to believe

112
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,860
so I'm internet MK Ultra has come to

113
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,380
mythologically represent my mind control

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,560
or mental control or other sorts of

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,340
things but in the original CIA documents

116
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,819
it talks about them devoting six percent

117
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,000
of their research and development budget

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,120
to types of research of an ultra

119
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,819
sensitive nature that they said they

120
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,680
cannot and should not be handled by

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,860
means of contracts which would associate

122
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,840
the CIA or the government with the work

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,919
in question so the idea was that the MK

124
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,600
Ultra projects weren't happening

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,060
in-house at the CIA but they were

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,100
Contracting other organizations and

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
universities and institutions to do the

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,560
work and they wanted it to have no

129
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,479
connection back to them

130
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,639
which finally today we're going to

131
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,880
unveil the majority of what had happened

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,300
in the projects and here's the original

133
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,180
document from the CIA talking about that

134
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,060
Ultra sensitive research is what they

135
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,800
were probably referring to

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,180
the crypto name MK was all the projects

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,180
that the Technical Services of the CIA

138
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,400
were doing and they were involved with

139
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,340
research and development they were doing

140
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,639
chemical biological and radiological

141
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,520
materials that they could use later on

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,680
in their secret operations to control

143
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,680
human behavior that was the goal of MK

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,539
Ultra it was a research and development

145
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,120
project to figure out the scientists

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,220
behind little things they could do to

147
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,800
get control over people whereas they

148
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,139
called MK Delta the operational

149
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,539
deployment of these materials

150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,319
so on June 6th they approved a budget

151
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,780
and it got rolling a little while

152
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,900
afterwards the whole project went to

153
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,699
about 1965 the last project wrapped up

154
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,340
there were 149 sub projects in total

155
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,940
with 86 institutions and these were the

156
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,419
institutions in North America

157
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,160
there were other International

158
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,860
institutions that were involved but when

159
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,699
the CIA and Congress started to disclose

160
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,979
these projects they really kind of

161
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,319
avoided mentioning the international

162
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,419
organizations

163
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,099
for whatever reason

164
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,800
but after MK Ultra wrapped up they did

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
another project called MK search which

166
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,419
was all the extra research projects that

167
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,220
were still ongoing they finished them up

168
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,740
in MK search

169
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,640
um

170
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
after MK Ultra happened

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,059
there started to be some public talk or

172
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,899
rumors of the CIA

173
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,339
experimenting on the public

174
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,779
after Watergate the CIA really panicked

175
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,839
and the director of the CIA homes

176
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,000
ordered that the MK Ultra documents

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,940
would be destroyed and then after Dr

178
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,180
Gottlieb Sydney Gottlieb was the

179
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,940
overseer of the whole MK Ultra project

180
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,000
after he retired he asked his secretary

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,040
to destroy some more of his private

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,300
papers

183
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,240
what we know about MK Ultra has come

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,940
from an additional set of documents were

185
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,459
which were Financial records that were

186
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,380
being stored in the basement of another

187
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,260
building so they avoided being destroyed

188
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,519
in the 1970s so what we've done is to

189
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,140
reconstruct an index of all the MK Ultra

190
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,860
projects using the original financial

191
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,500
documents and any other documents that

192
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,240
have survived in this in 1975 the

193
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,660
Rockefeller commission and in 1976 the

194
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,640
church Committee in Congress they

195
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,300
reviewed all the MK Ultra documents and

196
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,660
they of course had the

197
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,940
non-reducted version so they could see

198
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,160
what was going on in there and then they

199
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,440
produced some public documents based on

200
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,839
their reviews so some of the secrets

201
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,940
came out during those reviews and we can

202
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,100
learn about them from that

203
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,860
the result of MK Ultra was that

204
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,640
President Eisenhower issued an executive

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,700
order that any intelligence agencies or

206
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,920
government agencies had to get their

207
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
subjects informed consent documented for

208
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,459
any research so that uh what we'll see

209
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,500
in MK Ultra they were experimenting on

210
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,380
the public uh kind of willy-nilly

211
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,220
so here is the cover of the review that

212
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,899
was done by the select committee on

213
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,200
intelligence which they go through a lot

214
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,740
of the information on on human

215
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,779
experimentation and they were especially

216
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,200
interested in any radiation experiments

217
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,760
that could have happened

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,459
the original MK Ultra Charter did talk

219
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,700
about radiation experiments but it seems

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,579
the only radiation they did was tagging

221
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,220
LSD with a radioactive molecule so they

222
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,620
could trace it throughout the body

223
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,779
but they had a whole review on the human

224
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,180
radiation experiments

225
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,760
and if you are interested in finding the

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,040
Manchurian candidates there's interviews

227
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,220
by witnesses that spoke at the radiation

228
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,040
experiments about other mind control

229
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,680
aspects that was covered in the Press

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,620
but didn't make it into these reports

231
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,920
uh in 1979 John Marks he had filed many

232
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,740
foia requests with the CIA about MK

233
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,800
Ultra topics and they finally released

234
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,899
uh 16 000 pages to him uh and he wrote

235
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,600
this book The Search for The Manchurian

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,180
Candidate and he reviewed what he could

237
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,940
in the projects and came up with a

238
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,220
little under half of what had been going

239
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,320
on in the programs based on the

240
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,540
documents they released to him the

241
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,519
majority of the documents they released

242
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,399
were reducted but some other researchers

243
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,339
were revealed it was mainly researchers

244
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,920
who were responsible for human

245
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,260
experimentation that they uh revealed

246
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,320
and confirmed in the documents that they

247
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,440
were that they released to him

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
um

249
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,060
the documents that John Marks received

250
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,920
were given to the National Security

251
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,000
archive so if you happen to go to

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,519
Washington you can go and possibly check

253
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,320
them out I don't know if his said are

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,060
classified there

255
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,480
and he produced this index of projects

256
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,320
um

257
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,740
when you file a CIA foia they're very

258
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,420
good about it and they get back to you

259
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,339
pretty quickly nowadays you can follow

260
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,639
them online they'll send you a manila

261
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,760
colored envelope with their address

262
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,639
label in the corner which looks pretty

263
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,060
cool to receive and inside that manila

264
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,639
envelope is another white envelope

265
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,800
inside so they're double wrapped and

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,860
they both have security tape that's

267
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,600
anti-tamper proof so if you opened it or

268
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,279
saw someone tampering it looks pretty

269
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,800
frayed like the one on the bottom

270
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,279
and there is what a foia request looks

271
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,279
like this is when the CIA confirms that

272
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,980
they have information on a certain topic

273
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,740
and they say they'll look into it

274
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,480
often they'll just send you a letter

275
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
that says we cannot confirm or deny what

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,339
you're asking us about and that may be

277
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,839
an indicator that it's still a

278
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,019
classified project or subject

279
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,480
so in 2000 a doctor named Dr Colin Ross

280
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,940
he went to the CIA headquarters and he

281
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,459
had access to review the documents in

282
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,220
person he went in and he was allowed to

283
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,100
take a pencil and a pad of paper and he

284
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
could write notes based on the documents

285
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,079
that were being held housed at the CIA

286
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,839
and he wrote this great book called the

287
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,260
CIA doctors

288
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,980
and in that document or in this book he

289
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
produced an index of MK Ultra projects

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,199
from what he was able to Cipher from

291
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,360
what was known previously plus from what

292
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,639
he was able to learn from being in the

293
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,320
CIA and reading the documents in person

294
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,620
since this excellent book was published

295
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,160
this CIA has released the MK Ultra

296
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,680
documents onto the internet you can

297
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,779
download them all from The Black Vault

298
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,740
and it's a few gigs of files the ca

299
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,699
provided a a pretty rough index of like

300
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,220
what are in those documents but it's a

301
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,980
total disorganized mess but you can go

302
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
on the The Black Vault and they have a

303
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,820
great collection you can download

304
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,560
alternatively you can order a DVD from

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,860
the CIA for thirty dollars and they'll

306
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,839
hook you up with all the documents

307
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,699
another great website is Doug Valentine

308
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,740
has filed a lot of foia requests and

309
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,019
been really successful and we're gonna

310
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,300
use some of its documents for cracking

311
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,000
the MK open

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,839
so the CIA did release a highly redacted

313
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,480
version of their index of projects or

314
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,320
the 149 sub projects and you can see a

315
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,660
bunch of them listed there all the names

316
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,519
that haven't been redacted are some of

317
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,980
the more common names in MK Ultra that

318
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,600
have been talked about widely but the

319
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,120
deeper you go in the index the more

320
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,279
redacted it gets

321
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,680
and the description of the projects in

322
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,019
here are pretty vague so even they were

323
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,500
pretty tight-lipped about it

324
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,980
they released a briefing book in 76 when

325
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,620
they were doing the review of MK Ultra

326
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,040
they produced a booklet of details on

327
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,560
all the sub projects but again the

328
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,600
researcher names and the institutions

329
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,699
that were responsible are usually

330
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,100
blacked out

331
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,820
but we can make good work of that

332
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,620
so there's an index of Institutions that

333
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,459
were involved in MK Ultra

334
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,040
and quite a few of them agreed that

335
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,380
institutions were approached by the CIA

336
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,199
and they were let known that they had

337
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,620
participated in MKUltra the majority of

338
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
them were naive and they didn't know

339
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,880
that they had participated because they

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
uh

341
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,800
um were not told originally some

342
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,380
universities and institutions chose not

343
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,680
to be revealed but you can see in this

344
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
index all the institutions are

345
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,220
alphabetically listed so it's a hint

346
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,040
to use the ones that are blocked in and

347
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
we can start placing in institutions

348
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,600
that we know or that we figure out or

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,699
that have been revealed later

350
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,860
and they conveniently put on the right

351
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,079
side the sub-projects which were

352
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
responsible so this is really helpful if

353
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,480
we crack one sub-project then we could

354
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,579
know that the other sub-project was the

355
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,299
same institution but it's pretty nice

356
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,240
and convenient that they did that for us

357
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,039
there are 44 colleges and universities

358
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,919
15 research foundations and chemical

359
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,160
companies and drug companies and 12

360
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,919
Hospitals and Clinics and three penal

361
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,780
institutions

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,660
that participated these are all the

363
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,299
institutions that were confirmed by the

364
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,200
CIA and that uh uh there's quite a few

365
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,140
of them listed

366
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,600
that are in there

367
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,059
and

368
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,360
sometimes the CIA makes mistakes too you

369
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,539
can see on sub project 120 was Boston

370
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,059
University that's being revealed right

371
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,200
here today

372
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,600
they just forgot to reduct it out on one

373
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,059
page whereas every other instance is

374
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,780
blocked out so whoops put the secrets

375
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,860
out

376
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,720
sometimes they also confirmed

377
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,600
institutions like once in documents you

378
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,900
can see over the renzelay Polytechnic

379
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Institute it was blacked out originally

380
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
and I don't know how they kind of make

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,980
it look half blacked out but that's when

382
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,539
they later uh decide to unclassify that

383
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,280
institution so it was originally

384
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,980
classified but then for whatever reason

385
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,960
someone probably filed a foia or

386
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,360
something they uh released the name of

387
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,380
it

388
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,440
so we can plug those ones in in Congress

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,919
they confirmed a few institutions the

390
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,620
Georgetown University had received

391
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,419
hundreds of thousands of dollars to

392
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,900
build a building on campus and they also

393
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,179
were given another Grant a matching

394
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,000
Grant from the federal government so the

395
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,559
government was mad that they were paying

396
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,260
twice for this institution but you can

397
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,600
go there on Georgetown campus the

398
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,419
Lexington Rehabilitation Center

399
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,640
is unfortunate they were testing on

400
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,900
prisoners and at the University of

401
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,419
Rochester was confirmed in Congress that

402
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,059
they were doing those LSD radiation

403
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,799
experiments where they tagged the

404
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,780
molecule and then they could trace where

405
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,179
the LSD went throughout the body of

406
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,919
animals and then

407
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,679
it's not clear whether they tried it on

408
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,419
humans

409
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,820
these three institutions called Spring

410
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,799
Harbor the Smithsonian and the

411
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,860
University of Delaware decided just to

412
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,559
reveal that they had participated after

413
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
the initial revelations in the 70s have

414
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
happened they have like in the 90s and

415
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,120
2000s talked about it in the media more

416
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,160
so this is a list of some institutions

417
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,039
that have either been confirmed in the

418
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,740
press or that researchers have talked

419
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,860
about publicly or that one way or

420
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,039
another it has come out that they have

421
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,780
participated

422
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,600
but the institutions themselves and not

423
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,880
the ca they haven't confirmed so I've

424
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,340
called them unconfirmed but someone or

425
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,039
some institution or someplace has said

426
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,320
that they were participating

427
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,600
uh

428
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,620
so when we get into the researchers they

429
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,380
the CIA gave us

430
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,159
um

431
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,140
a bunch of them that they confirmed

432
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,559
participated the researchers themselves

433
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,059
also gave their name

434
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,240
for some of them that they uh uh had

435
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,340
participated and a lot of these

436
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,539
researchers

437
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,640
didn't know that their grants had come

438
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,340
from the CIA so the ca's one day sent

439
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,960
them a letter and said that remember

440
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
that Grant you got way back when yeah

441
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,740
that was from us you're welcome and now

442
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,620
you have the reputation of being a CIA

443
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,559
scientist when you didn't know

444
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,539
other

445
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,700
um

446
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,000
doctors did know and if you know

447
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,700
uh counseling and mental health Dr Carl

448
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,659
Rogers is the counselor psychologist I

449
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:22,740
created humanistic psychology he was

450
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,640
also completely witting of the M culture

451
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,100
project of the true purpose and he was

452
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,179
on the board of uh Society cut out front

453
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,000
called The Society for the investigation

454
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,080
of human ecology

455
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,679
the CIA decided it was a good way to

456
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,539
fund all their research by creating a

457
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,000
academic funding Grant agency and then

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,760
funneling the money through that they

459
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,559
filled their board with a military

460
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,440
members and also psychologists who were

461
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,140
waiting to the project but most of the

462
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,659
people who were granted through the

463
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,539
society were not witting of what was

464
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,960
going on

465
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:12,960
um

466
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,400
so this document that was released

467
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,280
um in Doug Valentine's foia collections

468
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,360
is really helpful so it lists when they

469
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,820
were reviewing human involvement in MK

470
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,360
Ultra the CIA did an internal review to

471
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,080
see what they were responsible with any

472
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,840
uh research on humans or on animals was

473
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,179
reviewed in this document and you can

474
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,700
see the sub-project numbers are listed

475
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,340
whereas the Institutions and researchers

476
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,500
are blocked out

477
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,960
but again once you crack one of these

478
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,480
research projects then you know who the

479
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,179
researcher is in the other ones so this

480
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,600
document comes in extra handy

481
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,500
um

482
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,440
so the methods that I used to crack a

483
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,559
lot of the MK Ultra projects that were

484
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,740
not previously released

485
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,539
were these three methods

486
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:18,299
sometimes in the documents they blacked

487
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,539
out a researcher's name but afterwards

488
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,780
they gave a very specific academic title

489
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,260
and role or job at the University

490
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,020
you can just quote that title and plug

491
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,960
it into Google and the exact same titles

492
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,900
will come up for researchers

493
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,360
um so you can know who they are just by

494
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,700
using their titles and we'll look at

495
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,659
that there's a method to look at what

496
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,360
the very specific research that was

497
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,480
being done in the sub project was and if

498
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,059
you can find that very specific research

499
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,059
at an institution you can also use other

500
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,640
Clues to link it up but then you know

501
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,919
that that was the research project

502
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,940
they're funding another method is to use

503
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,679
the society that granted the funds and

504
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,679
in academic papers it's really nice that

505
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,779
people give acknowledgments to all their

506
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,260
funders so you can look for the society

507
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,740
that was a CIA front and just go through

508
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,559
those papers and match the research as

509
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,360
it's described in the original CIA

510
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,880
documents to the research that happened

511
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,580
in the public sphere and you can connect

512
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,559
it that way

513
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,860
and by reviewing through the society

514
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,520
granting agency's internal reports that

515
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,400
they fund that they produced you can see

516
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
the uh money that was given to

517
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,980
researchers you can then go back to the

518
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,740
original CIA documents and connect to

519
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,960
the exact same funding dollar amount to

520
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,779
the ca documents so that's another way

521
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,720
to connect and know what projects or

522
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,020
which

523
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,220
so let's look at sub project 109

524
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,580
this project you can see below in the

525
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,760
CIA document was done by the professor

526
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,380
and the head of the Department of

527
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,179
pharmaceutical and medicinal kind of

528
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,279
mystery College of Pharmacy

529
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,000
at an unknown institution

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,799
uh it just quoted that and put it into

531
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,820
Google

532
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,400
and let's see what comes up oh Andrew

533
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
Laszlo

534
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,600
who was funded by

535
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,640
fund for medical research which was

536
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,880
another CA cut out front

537
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,520
we can see the exact same title the

538
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,100
professor and had of the Department of

539
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,020
pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry

540
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,720
College of Pharmacy and it conveniently

541
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,100
gives us the University of the

542
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,659
University of Tennessee

543
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,580
we can then take that back and plug it

544
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,700
into our alphabetical listing to reveal

545
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,440
that the tennis University of Tennessee

546
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,840
is on the list

547
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,039
another way to crack a project is to

548
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,580
look at such specific research that was

549
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,020
being done

550
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,520
so in sub-project 97 they told us it

551
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,440
happened at Harvard University they

552
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,260
didn't tell us the researcher and it's

553
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,960
into the feasibility of creating a

554
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
teaching machine

555
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,000
to treat foreign languages to their

556
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,360
agents and at that time it was pretty

557
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,820
rare for a teaching machine of languages

558
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,120
to be being produced seems like this was

559
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,059
the only one and would you know he talks

560
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,179
publicly about creating

561
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:48,179
his language machine and application of

562
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,000
psycholinguine linguistics of language

563
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,380
teaching and we now can see that the

564
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,740
author is John B I can't even see it

565
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,880
Carol

566
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,059
and so we find him and he also gives

567
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,159
acknowledgments to the society for the

568
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,740
investigation of human ecology

569
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,659
so we know that he did that

570
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,200
another method to crack a project is to

571
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,440
connect the society that funded it and

572
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,419
also to look at the amount that was

573
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,840
funded So Below we have the original CIA

574
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,020
document talking about this sub-project

575
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
117.

576
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,360
was funded for seven thousand seven

577
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
hundred

578
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,500
seven thousand seven hundred ninety

579
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,919
dollars which is a very specific amount

580
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,440
and when you know we could look in the

581
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,720
annual reports of the society for the

582
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,159
investigation of human ecology

583
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,140
there is the

584
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,779
um Harold wolf who is a doctor who

585
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,720
created the field of human ecology and

586
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,120
he created this Society for the CIA

587
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,799
funding

588
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,520
I went through archives all over North

589
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,919
America to find the reports and you find

590
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,100
them in strange places and researchers

591
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,500
archives but if you look around enough

592
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,320
and are really nice to the Librarians

593
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,299
they'll scan you copies when you find

594
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,860
them and send them to you all right

595
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,480
here's the report from uh 1960s here's

596
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,679
another one

597
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,740
and then in that

598
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,220
1961 to 1963 report we look and wouldn't

599
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,559
you know that project for 7 790 was

600
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,700
funded by Dr Yuri bronfenbrenner great

601
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,279
so that matches up then we can check uh

602
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,679
what research he was doing and look at

603
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,279
the CAA documents to see that it matches

604
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,940
so here is a list by going through all

605
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,700
of the institutions that way and using

606
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,860
those methods that I just described here

607
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,299
are all the institutions that are

608
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:04,980
unconfirmed but it seems that they are

609
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,559
the ones responsible so some of these

610
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,720
were confirmed by the CA and we've also

611
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,440
plugged in the unconfirmed ones so there

612
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,960
are the 86 institutions there's some of

613
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,840
them that we still don't know but of the

614
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,120
88 institutions in that original list

615
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
two of them were cross-listed and they

616
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,760
were just a hundred different names and

617
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,659
we get about 86 percent identified so

618
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,179
that's really great

619
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,179
by going through all the research papers

620
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,820
of the society for the investigation of

621
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,120
human ecology we can plug in the

622
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
researchers that seem to be that they

623
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,059
did the research we don't know for sure

624
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,940
unless one day the CIA decides to

625
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,520
unclassify the information but if we're

626
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,100
matching a public research projects to

627
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,279
the original CIA documents this is

628
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,100
likely the list of researchers and some

629
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,720
of these are confirmed again and some of

630
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,659
them we have filled in the blue colored

631
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:11,580
rows are the ones that we haven't

632
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,559
figured out and we don't know the

633
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,120
institutions or we don't know the

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,840
researchers but as you can see the

635
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,299
majority of projects can be known who

636
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:24,419
they are there were a few projects that

637
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,640
I've grayed out in my table that were

638
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,919
just money that they were moving around

639
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,740
that it wasn't a research project so I

640
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,559
took those out of the total of the

641
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,539
research but you can see looking through

642
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,820
uh we now

643
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,700
know the majority of the research

644
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,960
projects except for these institutions

645
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,320
these ones by the alphabetical list we

646
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,740
know what letter the institution starts

647
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,820
with

648
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,399
but some of them I do actually know what

649
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,100
they are but I don't have uh the right

650
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,320
references to prove it

651
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,299
uh

652
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,899
so this is the list of uh researchers

653
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,039
that are unknown they're 28

654
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,899
sub projects that I haven't figured out

655
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,360
who the researchers are

656
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,960
in many of the projects there were a PhD

657
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,419
who was the primary researcher who was

658
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,860
responsible

659
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,960
but just like now in science all the

660
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,140
work is done by their PhD students or

661
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,480
their grad students and a lot of the

662
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,080
projects published phds out of these

663
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,240
programs and I don't know if the PhD

664
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
students were ever told that their phds

665
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,899
were actually MK Ultra

666
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,159
so the books that we looked at

667
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,860
originally The Manchurian can or the

668
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,019
search for The Manchurian Candidate and

669
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,779
the CIA doctors one was written in the

670
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,200
70s and one was written 2000. I put a

671
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,539
one or a zero for the ones the

672
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,000
sub-projects that they definitely knew

673
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,059
I tried to be a little generous but uh

674
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,820
we filled in the columns thus you can

675
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,179
see the final column uh we've cracked

676
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,260
the majority of the projects

677
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,039
so uh John Mark

678
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,559
44.29 the CIA doctors had the same or

679
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,679
about uh with our projects were almost

680
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,980
up there getting almost towards double

681
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,080
would be my goal and there's a few more

682
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,539
projects I could figure out if I had

683
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,640
access to the libraries but we're

684
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,519
sitting at 80 right now which is pretty

685
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,460
good

686
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,159
so let's take a look at some of the

687
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
Publications that came out of MK Ultra

688
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,760
so a lot of the sub-projects that are

689
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,039
not cracked or not known are those

690
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,360
projects which are still classified all

691
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,480
the sub-projects that happened at public

692
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,460
institutions in the public eye you can

693
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,980
see the research papers in academic

694
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,220
journals and a lot of it is not what

695
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,620
Lisa Simpson would be afraid of but some

696
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,679
of it it would raise eyebrows probably

697
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,659
well let's take a look so sub project

698
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,840
one a study of the chemical constituents

699
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,120
and of the physiological properties of

700
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,140
Rivia querobosa this was the first

701
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,360
project done and it was done at Stanford

702
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,539
University and then moved over to some

703
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,640
different places while the researchers

704
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,659
went but this uh PhD student Eugene

705
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,320
keeland he wrote a PhD on the chemistry

706
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
of these little seeds that they call

707
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,779
Dream seeds it was the first psychedelic

708
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,779
that the ca could get their hands on and

709
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,760
they tested the chemistry of it

710
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,799
sub project six the CIA had asked Eli

711
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,559
Lilly Corporation if they would figure

712
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,179
out a way to make synthetic LSD

713
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,659
Sandoz Corporation and Switzerland I

714
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,000
believe they were the ones who had the

715
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,399
original patents and they were making

716
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,699
LSD from ergot fungus but it took a lot

717
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,520
of fungus to get some acid going so the

718
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,119
CIA wanted a way to produce a boatload

719
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,280
of acid basically

720
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,719
so the Eli Lilly corporation uh the CIA

721
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,460
proached them was a

722
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,800
nice check and they said they'd do it

723
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,000
for free

724
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
and

725
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,099
this researcher Richard P payock I don't

726
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,379
know if he ever knew that it was M

727
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,339
culture but he created a pathway for LSD

728
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:56,339
from biolumines or something but it's in

729
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:01,700
our organic way to produce produce LSD

730
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,680
project seven

731
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,260
Dr Harold Abram Abram's son was financed

732
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,400
by the CIA to discover all the basic

733
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,220
properties of LSD so he basically

734
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,040
started with Siamese fighting fish and

735
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,540
went from there

736
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,619
they published research on humans and on

737
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,140
how they could use it in Psychotherapy

738
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,240
and

739
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
um on chemistry and all sorts of stuff

740
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,060
so he did dozens and dozens in this LSD

741
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,859
series of articles

742
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,000
so what happened Frank Olson

743
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,119
was involved with some other programs

744
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,359
that were uh before and sort of around

745
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,660
MK Ultra

746
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,599
so The Story Goes that he was at this

747
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,020
summer camp that the CIA was using and

748
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Dr Sydney Gottlieb decided it would be a

749
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,839
great test to bring all his agents there

750
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,300
or his scientists and see what would

751
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,339
happen if he spiked the punch bowl with

752
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:15,000
acid so he went about and did that and

753
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,260
Frank Olson kind of lost it

754
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,420
he traveled back home and he was telling

755
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,540
his wife that he had to go to the media

756
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,520
or something or he had to confess that

757
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,460
he had done something terrible

758
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,280
we don't know exactly what he was

759
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,160
referencing

760
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,000
there has been speculation

761
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,200
that in a book by H.P alberelli Jr

762
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,900
called a terrible mistake he

763
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,200
hypothesized that the mistake

764
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
Frank Olson had done is that they had

765
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,720
drugged a whole French city with acid

766
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,579
and made the whole town go on Mad

767
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,820
without explaining to them what happened

768
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,920
they explained that that was ergot

769
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,980
poisoning but in that book they

770
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,800
hypothesized that that was the secret

771
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,839
I might know some things about the

772
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,640
secret too but yeah that's another

773
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,260
speech

774
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,480
but uh after he had kind of gone mad the

775
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,820
CIA told him we'll bring you to a doctor

776
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,359
and they brought them to Dr Abramson Dr

777
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,880
Abramson was an allergist which people

778
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,500
have criticized like why would you bring

779
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,460
him the Frank Olsen to an allergist but

780
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,220
Dr Abramson was basically one of the

781
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,099
world experts on LSD by using it in his

782
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,200
studies so they had hoped that they

783
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,960
could bring them to Dr Abramson and that

784
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,700
he would calm down

785
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,060
but it didn't have that effect and

786
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,960
originally they said uh whilst in a room

787
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,359
with another agent that he had run

788
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,880
headfirst and jumped out the through the

789
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,500
glass and onto falling onto the street

790
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,859
later on Frank Olson's children had his

791
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,280
body exhumed and they studied and saw

792
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,400
that his head had a giant bash to it so

793
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,060
they uh apologized to the family and

794
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,220
gave them some money I think and they

795
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,440
revised the story that he had maybe been

796
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,260
pushed out maybe

797
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,200
um in some project 54

798
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,960
they were looking at a new theory on the

799
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,839
Dynamics of brain concussion and brain

800
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,560
injury and it was by Arthur G gross this

801
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,079
was a project that was started in the

802
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,500
Navy or the Air Force and the CIA took

803
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,480
it up but because they were going to

804
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,700
test uh

805
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,579
brain concussion methods on cadavers

806
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,560
they didn't want to get their hands

807
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,599
dirty I don't think and it was canceled

808
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,060
but you can still read the research

809
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,380
paper in the Journal of neurosurgery

810
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,420
uh sub project 68 we see is an Infamous

811
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,640
project in

812
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,260
um

813
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,680
McGill University in Montreal Canada

814
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,740
there was Dr Ewing Cameron who at the

815
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,160
time he was the president of the world

816
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,240
Association of Psychiatry and he was

817
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,040
basically the man when it came to

818
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,720
psychiatry

819
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,320
so he had a money coming in across the

820
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,780
border uh from the CIA that funded his

821
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,720
supposed mental health treatments where

822
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,960
they were playing repetitive verbal

823
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,859
sayings into people's ears endlessly

824
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,380
while they were high on LSD while

825
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,720
they're isolated in a room

826
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,180
seems like that would be a great

827
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,740
treatment but actually it is horrifying

828
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,260
the results that it had in the research

829
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,359
papers they talk about how great it is

830
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,060
but if you ask the victims who are paid

831
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,460
out by the Canadian government and

832
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,339
apologize to it didn't have the desired

833
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,240
effect

834
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,880
what they were trying to do was wipe

835
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,060
someone's mind clear as if you could

836
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,119
clear it like an extra sketch and just

837
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,880
start from scratch but what happens is

838
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,520
you do regress someone back to being

839
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,240
totally incompetent and uh totally

840
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,740
non-functional

841
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,040
so this is the most infamous MK Ultra

842
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,000
project and it is uh there's a lot of

843
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,260
focus on

844
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,619
whether Dr Cameron knew that he was

845
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,140
being sponsored by the CIA

846
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,319
the Canadian government uh

847
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,960
decided that he didn't know and in the

848
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,900
documents it says he was unwitting but

849
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,000
you and Cameron actually had worked for

850
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,240
the CIA prior and had it a security

851
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,420
clearance so it's possible he might have

852
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,839
known

853
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,260
uh oh yeah and this is a shout out to

854
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,359
the society for the investigation of

855
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,819
human ecology in his paper

856
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,540
so you know he was sponsored by them

857
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,200
um

858
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
in sub project 77

859
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,819
they were analyzing the wesler adult

860
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:27,020
intelligence scale uh and creating

861
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,760
psychological profile tests

862
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,140
uh in sub-project 117 they were studying

863
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,680
as we learned Yuri braunfenbrenner was

864
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,599
studying Soviet personality and

865
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,240
socialization

866
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,079
in sub-project 21 they sent a

867
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,220
psychiatrist over to Yoruba Africa

868
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,980
to learn how Psychiatry was done over

869
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,540
there

870
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,900
by the witch doctors

871
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,040
uh

872
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,819
in subproject 133 we see microorganisms

873
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:06,480
and acid drainage from a copper mine

874
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,380
and in 134 they were reviewing a study

875
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,300
whether you could correlate someone's

876
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,500
personality to their body physique

877
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,240
it's good luck with that

878
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,780
in 147 human pharmacology and

879
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,060
addictiveness of certain isomers of

880
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,280
synthetic analgesics they are trying to

881
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,099
make synthetic codeine basically and

882
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,920
it's published at the United Nations

883
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,460
uh Elena did you want to talk about your

884
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,339
artwork so Atlanta's taken the

885
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:41,220
information from all the sub projects

886
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,700
and created an artwork visualization of

887
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,579
it and she's going to say a couple

888
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,980
minutes about it

889
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,839
okay I guess

890
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,420
um for this one

891
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,540
um

892
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,839
um so this is just a visualization I did

893
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,300
of the information because there's so

894
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,780
much data with this project so in this

895
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,960
visualization I've taken

896
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
the sort of floor plan of a panopticon

897
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,000
prison which was invented in the 18th

898
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,300
century by Jeremy Bentham and the idea

899
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,859
of the panoptrecon prison which is

900
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,480
probably familiar to a lot of people but

901
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,460
I still think is interesting for this is

902
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,220
that rather than have like a one

903
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,339
security guard like go through rows of

904
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,260
levels of a prison in which the prisoner

905
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,839
was aware when they were being monitored

906
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:35,400
you develop a prison so that there's

907
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,560
only one guard in the center and all the

908
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,200
cells are radiating around it so the

909
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,359
prisoners don't have a perception of

910
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:44,460
when they're being watched this kind of

911
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,520
centralizes surveillance and it acts as

912
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,680
a surveillance is less directional and

913
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,220
more sort of interior so your sense of

914
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,079
being surveilled is the thing that is

915
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,020
functioning not necessarily if you are

916
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,180
being surveilled so for this information

917
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,160
I thought that was interesting because I

918
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,740
think the MK Ultra project its Legacy

919
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,079
sort of surpasses the actual research we

920
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,780
were looking at and it becomes more

921
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,420
situated in culture but also

922
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,339
um sort of people's ideas of this like

923
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,579
omnipresent government and being

924
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,500
surveilled through these programs or at

925
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,560
least having the the chance of that so

926
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,359
I've taken that I've also added an eye

927
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,619
because

928
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,780
um I like the I mean it is just watching

929
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,760
you but also I sort of like that radial

930
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,920
pattern so that's what that looks like

931
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,480
without the

932
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,400
um the floor plan

933
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,880
and then so here is all of the studies

934
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,700
and the sub projects so listed in a

935
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,400
radial pattern and you can zoom into it

936
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,400
to see the sort of Institutions and the

937
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,839
professors who were responsible and the

938
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,359
numbers of the sub-projects and then to

939
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,119
visualize that data that Josh has

940
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,700
uncovered I've added the greens so those

941
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,500
are all the new

942
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,680
um sort of cracked projects

943
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,640
that's yeah

944
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,640
[Applause]

945
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,200
so you can see

946
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,400
with simple open source techniques we

947
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,359
can crack this project wide open

948
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:21,660
so where are those manchurians

949
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,200
in the project 128 they claimed in some

950
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,780
of the extra books on MKUltra that they

951
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,720
were testing rapid hypnosis to see if

952
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,460
they could hypnotize someone on the spot

953
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,579
and make a Manchurian Candidate then it

954
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,400
didn't work out so yeah

955
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,980
here's all the references

956
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,800
uh so yeah now you know if someone asks

957
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,660
you why Homer doesn't trust the

958
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,359
government it's maybe more about

959
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,660
academic projects but possibly MK Ultra

960
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,859
was used as a limited hangout just to

961
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,040
cover up more uh

962
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,220
um still classified projects where the M

963
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,560
The Manchurian candidates maybe were

964
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,740
produced and thank you so much did we

965
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,460
have any questions or anyone

966
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:19,020
[Applause]

967
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,020
um

968
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,440
okay turn this mic on

969
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,119
one of those projects toward the end was

970
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,040
something about acid drainage from a

971
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,319
copper mine I assume that the copper

972
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,480
mine wasn't the brain or something like

973
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
what it What was the acid drainage

974
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,859
project about do you have any idea

975
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,520
they were looking for certain

976
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,740
microorganisms that could cause trouble

977
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,440
basically they were interested in things

978
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,440
like crop destruction or if they could

979
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,680
use organisms for other Mischief

980
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,619
basically but it's interesting to see

981
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,640
that those research papers have a hidden

982
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,180
dual meaning or purpose behind them but

983
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,339
it also contributes to The Wider science

984
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:14,180
journals and knowledge and everything

985
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,040
anyone else have a question

986
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,480
hello I'm Xander thanks for the great

987
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,619
talk

988
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,359
um I'm wondering if your spreadsheets

989
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,220
are available

990
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,160
yes after this talk it will find its way

991
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,440
to the internet

992
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,339
and it will be available on my website

993
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,819
called joshhealthcare.com

994
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm actually a registered clinical

995
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,460
counselor

996
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,059
so I will provide the slides on that

997
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:49,079
website

998
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,260
I also wanted to ask if I may

999
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,220
um what are what are your thoughts on

1000
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,599
um how this relates to in q-tel so this

1001
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,800
is sort of the cia's present day

1002
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,520
Venture investment arm and

1003
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,020
it seems there are some similarities

1004
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,480
they invest in fundamental science so

1005
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,160
just what are your thoughts on the

1006
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,420
relationship between the two

1007
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,319
um well this was a research and

1008
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,240
development project and they're hoping

1009
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,660
to find some keys to lock unlock

1010
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,480
people's minds they didn't really find

1011
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,640
what they were looking for so much but

1012
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,079
um

1013
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,859
yeah

1014
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,240
any other question

1015
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,280
um hello Suare

1016
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,660
um what I noticed and found interesting

1017
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,599
was it seemed like uh the CIA got pretty

1018
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,220
sloppy with the redactions and you were

1019
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,980
able to to use these techniques that

1020
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,660
exploited the sort of sloppiness of the

1021
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,760
redactions in a number of ways I was

1022
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,720
wondering if you if you've noticed

1023
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,920
or or if you know anything about like

1024
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,960
newly newly released material that's

1025
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,559
been redacted or or censored

1026
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:11,520
if if they've learned from their

1027
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,140
mistakes or if there's still sloppiness

1028
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,940
that people take advantage of I guess

1029
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,500
I'm just curious about

1030
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,880
um yeah if there's been Improvement or

1031
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,079
if they're still pretty sloppy or if

1032
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,280
they're sloppy in new ways that they

1033
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,480
weren't previously

1034
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,020
yeah definitely they have I think

1035
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,880
learned from the mistakes but

1036
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,240
there was the public being concerned and

1037
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,640
the public starting to learn about it

1038
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,240
and uh being afraid of the CIA that made

1039
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,220
them or kind of forced them to reveal

1040
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,859
all this nowadays they really really

1041
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,079
don't want to disclose things and they

1042
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,020
want to keep it Ultra hidden which is

1043
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,140
what this project was supposed to be

1044
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,599
as you can see in such a what wide

1045
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:56,880
amount of data there's always clues that

1046
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,059
will link up the projects and especially

1047
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:03,059
if things happened in the public domain

1048
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:05,520
you can't really keep it secret unless

1049
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,579
you block out the whole document so yeah

1050
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:10,500
a lot of people get totally blacked out

1051
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,780
documents when they do foyers or they

1052
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,660
just get a we can't confirm or deny

1053
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,839
basically that's usually what you get

1054
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,119
from them uh

1055
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,339
yeah thank you yeah

1056
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,040
the CIA and the FBI seem to have this

1057
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,859
history of using proxies to do their

1058
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:32,640
work

1059
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,200
um has you or found any interesting ways

1060
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,000
of like I know for example that some

1061
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,400
people have done research into like

1062
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,900
fixed-wing aircrafts and identifying the

1063
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,059
sort of proxy companies that the FBI

1064
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,040
uses to identify the fixing aircraft

1065
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,319
have you found any interesting ways of

1066
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:52,319
sort of separating the proxies

1067
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,480
identities and like okay this one's this

1068
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,579
one's clearly a proxy shell company and

1069
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:57,900
this one's just a regular company or

1070
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,640
something

1071
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,800
yeah they really don't like to talk

1072
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,859
about their shell companies until it's

1073
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,200
so blatantly obvious

1074
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,839
there's certain laws where they have to

1075
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,440
disclose funding and uh with some

1076
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,420
agencies they have to like talk about

1077
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,000
what's being funded sometimes you have

1078
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,339
to like read between the lines of what

1079
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:21,240
their

1080
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,760
telling you is being funded and maybe

1081
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,380
what they could do with that

1082
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,040
alternatively

1083
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,480
there's usually people who talk though

1084
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,420
uh researchers

1085
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,359
often talk about their research

1086
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,059
somewhere publicly and if you know the

1087
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:44,220
very specific science they're talking

1088
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,680
about and can understand it you could

1089
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,540
place just a few words to understand

1090
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,940
certain research but

1091
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,280
yeah it's impossible to keep humans in

1092
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,099
Black boxes so let's offend a weak spot

1093
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,619
where info comes out

1094
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,880
thank you

1095
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,460
yeah and watch the skies you'll see all

1096
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,940
those aircrafts top secret flying around

1097
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,000
one last question yeah we know about the

1098
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,859
extensive involvement Canada had with

1099
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,319
regards to MK Ultra were there other

1100
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,540
countries that cooperated with the CIA

1101
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,760
and MK Ultra

1102
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,640
yeah so

1103
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,839
right before MK Ultra they had a

1104
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,839
predecessor top secret program called

1105
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,720
Bloomberg which transformed to artichoke

1106
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,960
in Bluebird the CIA

1107
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,160
and Canada and the UK met together for a

1108
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,440
secret meeting in Montreal and they

1109
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,839
basically divvied up who was going to do

1110
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,900
which work so in that original Alliance

1111
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,960
it was Canada it was America and it was

1112
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,579
the UK

1113
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,400
there were researchers from New Zealand

1114
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,280
and from Australia that came and trained

1115
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,079
with the doctors

1116
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,660
so some people think it was an old boys

1117
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,880
club where they kind of uh were

1118
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,640
exchanging information by the visiting

1119
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,359
Scholars and transporting MKUltra around

1120
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,500
the world

1121
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,420
but yeah the three main countries Canada

1122
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,220
the UK and America

1123
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:19,619
anyways thank you so much for having me

1124
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,859
and I hope that you have a fabulous rest

1125
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,380

00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,020
and live it up this weekend thank you so
