00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
thank you for wearing your mask

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
throughout the conference we really

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
appreciate it it has been very helpful

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
to us to help maintain our commitment to

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
everyone's health and safety

43
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,040
if you have a phone please make sure

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
it's turned off for the for this talk

45
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
it's important the audio visual

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
equipment is very sensitive and picks up

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
a cell phone

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
chatter very easily

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
and with that this is a virtual talk if

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
you have questions pin the questions to

51
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,680
the end the speaker won't be able to see

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
you or hear you directly so they'll go

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
through their talk if you have questions

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
you can either enter in the matrix chat

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
for this talk or you can save them to

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,319
the end of the qa

57
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
you can relay them to me and or you can

58
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
come to the speaker of the microphone

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
and relate them to the speaker when we

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,879
get to the qa session

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
so with that the talk is combating

62
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,879
ransom war evolving landscapes of

63
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
ransomware infections in cloud databases

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
by aditya snoo

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
so with that off to india

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
thanks man

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
so let's get it started first of all i

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
really want to be you know very proud to

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
be here and the reason for that is

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
because i believe that you know hope is

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
such a great platform where you can

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
present your research without any

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
hassles of uh you know marketing and all

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
that it's a pure piece where we actually

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
go ahead and share our research and that

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
is one of the most driving factor you

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
know we love to be here and first and

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
we'll really be very thankful to the

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
committee members who are giving this

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
opportunity to us

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
so let's get it started so today topic

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
is about combating ransomware the idea

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
is to understand the evolving landscape

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,200
of ransomware infections in cloud

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
databases

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
we have talked about you know ransomware

87
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
infections that are happening in end

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
user systems you know an organization

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
and all that but these guys are not

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
stopping there they're actually going

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
after databases whether it's on cloud or

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
on-premise but in this research we are

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
going to focus on that

94
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
so before moving further a little

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,879
disclaimer

96
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
so the idea behind the presentation of

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
this research is to share the

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
intelligence with the security research

99
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
community

100
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,320
the target is the research can be used

101
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
in myriad always you know every

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
individual can go back and utilize this

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
research

104
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
build new stuff new tools

105
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
and actually can you know how as a

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,600
collective as a security community we

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
can go ahead and

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
come back ransomware

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
and that is the most important thing

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
because the community we need to come

111
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
together and share our intelligence and

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
research

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
so that we can make the best of the

114
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
ability of ourselves

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
so with that

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
a little bit background of mine who am i

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
i have added couple of links if you are

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
interested you can take a look at it the

119
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,919
main purpose of having this slide is to

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
show that what we are going to present

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
we've been working heavily on this part

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,639
as a part of our research and threat

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,120
intelligence we've been into this field

124
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
and we are going to share pretty

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
interesting insights with you

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
but you can go and look into some of the

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
my links where you can find

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
background information a lot of other

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
additional research that we have done in

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
the field

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
so let's talk about what the agenda

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
going out to be

133
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
so at first we are going to look into

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
the modern applications architecture

135
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
very important to understand how the

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
technology world is evolving

137
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,919
then we talk about you know how cloud

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
databases are heavily used from modern

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,560
applications

140
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
of course we are going to look into

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
threats that are targeting cloud

142
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
databases

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,199
and after that we will going to

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
understand

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
what are the infection root causes for

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
that you know why attackers are going

147
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
after cloud databases you know what are

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
the reasons

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,440
we will look into the real world

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
examples of infected cloud databases

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
and then we'll introduce two tools that

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
we have developed and philot and

153
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,440
straffer

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
that actually helped you to

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
figure out

156
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
what kind of cloud databases out there

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
that are infected with ransomware

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
so these are very specific tools to

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,039
mongodb and elasticsearch which we'll

160
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,000
talk about later in this talk and of

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
course we will conclude where we stand

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and what the future

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,639
ahead of us

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
so let's look into the modern

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
applications architecture and why it is

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
important it is important because you

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,560
know

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
this is a world where we are deploying

169
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,720
the infrastructure in cloud right

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
because of mobility data is expanding at

171
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
an exponential rate you know the way

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
data transactions are happening so we

173
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
need a different applications

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
architecture we just cannot rely on old

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
traditional technologies because that's

176
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
not how the world is at the moment

177
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
so let's take a look into is an overview

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
to just set the baseline

179
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
so if you look at into this basic

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
architecture what we are highlighting

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
here is that you know starting from the

182
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
deployment side you know when we perform

183
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
code development you know devops

184
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
operations are being done you know the

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
code is picked up code rappers are

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
designed then of course we have

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
continuous integration and continuous

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
deployment pipelines

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
with an integration with an automation

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,840
and then you have a sporting

191
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
infrastructure with respect to it like

192
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,199
infrastructure you know what kind of

193
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
security networking application

194
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
networking and the applications you

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
deploy

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
but if you're looking on the right side

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,919
the more important part is that when you

198
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,000
deploy the code within a proper

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
automated way in the cloud so what

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
exactly you're going to consume there as

201
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
a part of the infrastructure

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,479
those are like cloud services we have

203
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,560
either it can be entirely on cloud or we

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
can have a bare metal

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
and then we have of course the most

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
important part here is the the database

207
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
and why it is so important because

208
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
that's where your currency resides when

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,919
i use the term currency i'm talking

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
about e-currency and when i talk about

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
e-currency i'm basically adhering to the

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
data because when you process the data

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
ample amount of information is extracted

214
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
out of it and that is the most important

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
key these days

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
from

217
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
business purposes from any part you know

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,759
understanding the insights and

219
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
everything you need data

220
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
and that's where the money is

221
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
rest is all about a sporting factor

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
which are going to actually translate

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
you know the data factors into many

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
different areas but the most important

225
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
part in this case is that you know the

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
databases

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,600
and that's why attackers are going after

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,640
them because that's where the money is

229
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
but overall if you look at it we have

230
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
different components these days as a

231
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
part of our proper devops

232
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,160
practices

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
but at the end of the day when the

234
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,920
applications you know

235
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
ingest data at the end of the day the

236
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
data goes back into the database

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
and with that

238
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,040
we need to look into the different cloud

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
databases that are used by modern

240
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
application these days

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
why i'm very specific to cloud databases

242
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
because our research is focused on the

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
databases that are deployed in the cloud

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
and have an external interface

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,920
that's how these applications are

246
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
interacted with it

247
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
basically talk about sas applications

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
right

249
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
and that's why we are very specific to

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,519
cloud databases but the research cannot

251
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,480
be only adhered to cloud databases here

252
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
it can be any type of databases deployed

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
in on premise or in cloud as well

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
so let's take a look into the cloud

255
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
databases scenario in very simple terms

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
you know we have a relational databases

257
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
we have non-relational databases

258
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
these days non-relational databases are

259
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
also very important and if we categorize

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
them we will have elasticsearch solar we

261
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
will have mongodb you know couchdb and

262
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
all that the idea is to more frequent

263
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
and fast transactions that happening

264
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
with an application

265
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,040
because we need to process the

266
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
incoming data in a very fast manner and

267
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
give the responses

268
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
and that's why some of the way you know

269
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
people are preferred non-relational

270
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,519
databases

271
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,279
but it doesn't mean that you know

272
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
relational databases are out of the way

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
they are still there with the sticky

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
applications in the wild

275
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
but what we are seeing right now is that

276
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
you know where you have to develop cloud

277
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
applications non-relational ones are the

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
key

279
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,560
and if we categorize them further

280
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
you can clearly see as a part of the

281
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
structure query languages we can have no

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
sql databases or a sql based

283
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,480
of course we have to write down proper

284
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
structure query language and very

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
definitive queries to query that

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
database

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
processing time is high you know latency

288
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,480
issues and all that with no sql

289
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
architecture is a bit different

290
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
more fast operations result in faster

291
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
responses which means that you can move

292
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
your data faster based on a very smart

293
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
decisions

294
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
by the infrastructure resources as well

295
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
as by the applications so if user for

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,279
example if user is moving in and out of

297
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
the different geographical boundaries

298
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
you need to ensure that you know data

299
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
transactions are happening at faster

300
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,440
pace you cannot go back to the your

301
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,839
part of the core data center to just

302
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,480
have the database process those requests

303
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
you need to figure out multiple ways so

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
that you know with a mobility and a fast

305
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
data transaction speed that happens

306
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,399
with that it also gives rise to the new

307
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
threat models right if you're not

308
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,240
following a traditional set of

309
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
technologies or architecture and if

310
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
you're going after new

311
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
architecture supporting modern

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
applications the threat model changes as

313
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,079
well right so what exact what exactly i

314
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
mean by that you know if we're deploying

315
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,399
applications in cloud the threat changes

316
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
the perception changes and the way

317
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,839
attackers are going to

318
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,399
target these application changes as well

319
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
so that's what the perspective is right

320
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,399
so every threat model is specific you

321
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
can have a standard security controls

322
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,639
and force but it cannot serve the

323
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,240
purpose

324
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
in the entry because at the end of the

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
day you have to very specific to your

326
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
needs and you have to build threat

327
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
models according to that

328
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
so with that

329
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,839
let's just understand a few

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
characteristics of white cloud databases

331
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
used from our own applications

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
more important part is like a

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
peer-to-peer cloud syncing for mobile

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
and edge computing you define edge and

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,279
you know have to make sure that data

336
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
syncing happens in a very fast manner or

337
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
appear to appear in the same node or in

338
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
the same cloud in the same vpc

339
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,959
and that actually helps with the design

340
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
of new nosql databases

341
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
we really need a high performance memory

342
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,959
driven

343
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,240
databases that actually help us to build

344
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
and perform distributed transactions in

345
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,279
a short period of time and that's where

346
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
nosql based databases are

347
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,760
we really need an integration with a

348
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,160
multi-cloud or an hybrid cloud

349
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
environment because for example in

350
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
certain organization you can have your

351
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
data

352
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
are you know stored entirely in the

353
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,639
cloud or they have a hybrid

354
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
infrastructure which means some of the

355
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
data depending on the criticality or

356
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
sensitivity stored in the cloud and

357
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
other one

358
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
will be in the on premises so you really

359
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,800
need to build a solution that actually

360
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
integrates with both scenarios

361
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
and of course we need something which is

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,959
like accessible via query score which

363
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
means you can write very generic queries

364
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
and in every infrastructure it works

365
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,120
efficiently

366
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
so there are some of these factors why

367
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,680
these nosql databases like mongodb and

368
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
elasticsearch etc are the preferred

369
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,120
choice because of these capabilities and

370
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
that's why you see heavy deployment of

371
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,639
these databases in the cloud

372
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,720
so now the next question is that at this

373
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
point of time we looked into the cloud

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
databases and the modern application

375
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,600
architecture you know what are nosql and

376
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
sql databases you know what are the

377
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
preferences these days and then we

378
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
actually had a look into

379
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,959
what are the reasons and the

380
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,600
characteristics of the preferences that

381
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
the developers are taking to opt for

382
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
nosql databases

383
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,360
now the simple question is do you think

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,959
there are no threats exist for these

385
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
databases because they are you know used

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
for modern application and deployed in

387
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
the cloud

388
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
let's take a look at it

389
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
the very first

390
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,680
threat model that we're going to focus

391
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,760
here is that the ransomware attacks here

392
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,959
right

393
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
as we have discussed earlier you know

394
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,279
data is the new currency right who

395
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
control controls the data who has an

396
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
entirely

397
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
you know the complete

398
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
idea about what kind of data is being

399
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
stored and what kind of insights that

400
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
you can get out of it will control the

401
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,199
business flow

402
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
and of course data can be processed and

403
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
used in multiple ways as well

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
and the similar thought process reside

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,639
in the attacker's mindset as well right

406
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
if what if i control the data

407
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
so what

408
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
in earlier

409
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,839
if you look at like a 10 years or 20

410
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
years back when we had these kind of

411
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
attacks happening more our fault like

412
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
fun and profit control and all that

413
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
these days everything is

414
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
translated back into monetary terms

415
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
right attackers are thinking we are

416
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
being you know doing these kind of

417
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
attacks and tricks in our use for a long

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
period of time why don't we also gonna

419
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
make some money

420
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
in order to do that they really need to

421
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,720
control that data which means they

422
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
really need to compromise the databases

423
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
and what is the best solution out of

424
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
that is with respect to

425
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,720
other than renzovira right because once

426
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
you infect the databases you control the

427
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,639
data and then you can ask for ransom and

428
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,800
all that

429
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
another one that we are seeing all

430
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,399
across is like the data destruction

431
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,600
scenario

432
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
what exactly that means you know

433
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
attackers are in mindset they don't care

434
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
about the data all they care about is

435
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
totally destructing the data which means

436
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
that it's going to resonate back into

437
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
the availability scenario

438
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
and what happens if your applications

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
are not able to access the data that is

440
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
stored in database it could have a

441
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
significant impacts

442
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
to the organization

443
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
and that is the most important threat

444
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
model impacting the data availability

445
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
and we have seen some threats where you

446
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
know they have designed neobot or meow

447
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
kind of related infections or variants

448
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
of it to actually completely destroy the

449
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
data in the database by encrypting it or

450
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
just making it render useless

451
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
and we will take a look into

452
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,160
all those scenarios

453
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
so let's just look at the practical

454
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
threat and attack landscape so in this

455
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,560
particular talk we are going to focus on

456
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
mongodb and elasticsearch

457
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,359
so these are the you know news uh you

458
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
know mean headlines that you get taken

459
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
out of different set of uh you know uh

460
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
news that have been

461
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
released on the internet you can clearly

462
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
see how big this

463
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
problem is and it is not related to

464
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
mongodb we'll take a look at elastic

465
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,400
search

466
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,679
as well

467
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
so this actually highlights that how

468
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,799
significant threat landscape has changed

469
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,320
attackers are actually kind of going

470
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
after mongodb instances that are

471
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
deployed in the cloud you try to find a

472
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
vulnerability

473
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
in them and you know or exploit them and

474
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
install ransomware on the host and then

475
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
which actually basically

476
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,280
going after encrypting the data directly

477
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
into the indices

478
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,039
but this actually highlights that you

479
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
know the problem is significant and we

480
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,120
really need to deal with it

481
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,039
similarly if you look at some of the

482
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,480
headlines that are related to

483
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,960
elasticsearch and factions you can

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,240
clearly see

485
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,039
that the attackers are not stopping on a

486
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,200
very specific databases they are

487
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,799
actually going to go after myriad of

488
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,480
them

489
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
and you can see it they are

490
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
started attack campaigns you know they

491
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
are turning the elastic circumstances

492
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
into

493
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,760
uh

494
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
a storage system which are useless in

495
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
nature by encrypting the data or

496
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
destructing the data

497
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
and that can have a potential impact on

498
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,200
the state of the applications because

499
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
if you're not going to access the data

500
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
you're not going to process the data

501
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,760
what will you do as a part of the

502
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
business

503
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,039
it's a significant problem that we are

504
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,679
facing these days

505
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
so now the most important part that we

506
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
have to understand here is what are the

507
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,880
infection root causes you know why this

508
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
is happening in the wild what are the

509
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,559
problems

510
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
or what are the issues that are residing

511
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
in the environment that could lead to

512
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,520
these kind of scenarios

513
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
so there are a couple of

514
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,960
of them

515
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
the most important part i will be

516
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,919
focusing

517
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
on the technical controls

518
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
xposed database administrative

519
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
interfaces you know you're deploying

520
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,559
your cloud uh your database

521
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,240
you know and then you know you're not

522
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
able to restrict the administrative

523
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,919
interface to the

524
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
specific set of authorized users

525
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
because you know you have to configure

526
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
the security groups you have to

527
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
configure some kind of access groups and

528
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
you know make you know

529
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
wrong configuration there or your

530
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
configuration is not in line with the

531
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
hardening guidelines that could lead to

532
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
the explorer to anywhere on the internet

533
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
so once you do that your administrative

534
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
interfaces exposed attackers can do

535
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
different things

536
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,559
another one nobody is like untouched by

537
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,760
it is like a weak and default passwords

538
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
also a problem

539
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
because then you can actually launch

540
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
brute force or account cracking uh

541
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
attempts to go after controlling the

542
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
database by simply cracking the

543
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,080
credentials

544
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,919
another important part is that you know

545
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,840
exploiting security vulnerabilities in

546
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,600
the database software

547
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
let's say for example most of these

548
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
cloud databases have a network service

549
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
associated with it which means like you

550
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
know you can access the interface any

551
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
fear from the

552
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,400
internet

553
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
are you residing in any geographical

554
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,159
location on the internet

555
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,679
which means there is a network service

556
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,360
and if there is some sort of inherent

557
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
flaw or security issue exist there is

558
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
this opening channel where you can

559
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
attackers can target to actually exploit

560
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,000
that vulnerability in order to

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,080
control the database by sitting remotely

562
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,320
another one is like you know

563
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,640
this is an indirect way that what we are

564
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,200
going to discuss to actually target each

565
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,559
databases

566
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
it's like if you're sitting in an

567
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,679
organization you're working for an

568
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,679
organization and attacker is able to

569
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,120
actually

570
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
control

571
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
your end user system by installing a

572
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
malware and somehow you are an

573
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,600
authorized user in a cloud environment

574
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
of for that particular organization

575
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
then the attackers can actually use your

576
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
compromised and user systems to actually

577
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
attack the cloud as well by performing

578
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
lateral movement or doing some kind of

579
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,320
another behavioral checks they can

580
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
launch other attacks like scanning in

581
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,919
the cloud environment once you connect

582
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
it to the cloud and things like that

583
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
lateral movement in cloud infrastructure

584
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,919
if they are able to compromise one

585
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,600
container or they're able to compromise

586
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
one vm they can actually try to see

587
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,720
which other containers under a specific

588
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,360
ip address range reside in the vpc so

589
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
that they can see

590
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
if the same one level configuration

591
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,080
exists there so that they can actually

592
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
control it social engineering attacks to

593
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
target cloud accounts like phishing

594
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,799
attempts and all that

595
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
asking targeted users to actually you

596
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,559
know reveal or leak the information by

597
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
you know conducting trickeries

598
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
and ensuring them the users fall for it

599
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
and giving you ample amount of

600
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
information so there are myriad of ways

601
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,679
like how cloud databases

602
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,240
are being targeted and the infections

603
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
are being triggered but we have

604
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,919
discussed the main ones here but there

605
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,280
could be many more as well

606
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
so now it is important to understand

607
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
from threat intelligence perspective

608
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
right how we can collect detection

609
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,400
signals out of it right we really need

610
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,559
to see who is that actually accessing

611
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
our databases you know what kind of

612
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
you know access has been maintained or

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
what kind of incoming network

614
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,520
connections that we are seeing and many

615
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
more to it

616
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
so if we look at it you know some of the

617
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
basic signal collection that you can

618
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,799
perform is you know file integrity

619
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,960
monitoring we really need to see the

620
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
critical

621
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
files that are specific to different

622
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,360
databases how these files are changed

623
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
how these files are accessed what

624
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
modifications are being performed

625
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919
that is you can perform by file

626
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,720
integrity monitoring on the cloud host

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
of course you have to go after scanning

628
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,159
cloud databases as well both

629
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,039
authenticated and unauthenticated scans

630
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,960
which actually gives you the idea the

631
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
level of exposure your database is

632
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
having

633
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
and you know what are the threat models

634
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,799
that are associated with it

635
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,760
so

636
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
in this particular case you can also

637
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,960
kind of look at the outbound

638
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
connectivity which is the most important

639
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,679
part

640
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,600
and this is resonate back to the data

641
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
exfiltration

642
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,159
how how that rate is related so let's

643
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,159
say if you're one of the cloud host is

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
infected that is running database you

645
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
know software and if you have not

646
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
properly protected it like the security

647
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
groups are not there access controls are

648
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
not there so the compromised host can be

649
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
used to set up a communication channel

650
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
with command and control that is

651
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,559
residing somewhere on the internet

652
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,320
but because the outbound network

653
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
connections are not exactly

654
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,679
filtered or

655
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,039
you know

656
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
restricted there's a possibility that

657
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,760
data exfiltration can take place

658
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
also you have to examine api calls on

659
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
the host how they are interacting you

660
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,000
know what kind of perform actions they

661
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,159
are performing and things like that and

662
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
there are many other ways you can

663
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
collect the signals

664
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
but as a part of the research what we

665
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,679
are going to target like on the scanning

666
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,440
cloud databases

667
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
basically their network level processes

668
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
and the tools that we have developed are

669
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
focused on this kind of threat

670
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
intelligence

671
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,080
practice which means that we are going

672
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,919
to see what is being exposed to what

673
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,919
level it is being exposed

674
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,520
and what are the configuration of the

675
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
databases can we access it can we have

676
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
an administrative access can we run some

677
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
commands

678
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,960
and different kind of these activities

679
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,520
and that's why our two tools that we are

680
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,679
going to discuss with you

681
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,400
forms that falls into the category of

682
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
scanning cloud databases sitting

683
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,559
remotely and we will show that as a part

684
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,600
of our demo as well

685
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,159
so at this point of time we have looked

686
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,279
into

687
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,919
modern application architecture you know

688
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880
relational non-relational databases

689
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
sporting sql and nosql

690
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,080
layout how queries can be done and then

691
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,279
we looked into some of the

692
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,440
characteristics of these cloud databases

693
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
and why they are being preferred these

694
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,320
days

695
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
after that we look into the threat model

696
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
of cloud databases you know

697
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
elasticsearch and mongodb

698
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,559
we looked into ransomware specific

699
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
threat model also as you know data

700
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
destruction specific threat model

701
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,279
and then we looked into some of the root

702
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
causes try to understand why it is

703
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
happening

704
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,440
and now we are going to take a deep dive

705
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
into the real world examples you know

706
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
the idea here is to understand you know

707
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
when elasticsearch

708
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,279
or mongodb databases are infected

709
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,760
how it looks like so in this part we are

710
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,120
going to take a deep dive into it

711
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
so let's take a example

712
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,200
here

713
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,360
so in this specific layout you can

714
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
clearly see

715
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,760
this one is related to

716
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
primarily but i think this one is also

717
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
related to the mongodb which will take a

718
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
look at it

719
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
if you take a look at it in this

720
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
particular scenario we were actually

721
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,640
going through one of the database either

722
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,960
a collection or an indices

723
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,640
and you can clearly see in this spot

724
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
there isn't a ransom message added to it

725
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,600
like all your data is packed up you must

726
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
pay this is this to this bitcoin id and

727
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
things like that

728
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
so this is how exactly some of the

729
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,159
signals that we collect

730
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,960
and this is giving the example of how

731
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,799
infected database actually looks like

732
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,520
so if i go to the next level i have not

733
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,840
actually masked the ip addresses to just

734
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,679
highlight like these are the real world

735
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,200
that are exposed

736
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,799
and how it looks like so you can give it

737
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,080
a try

738
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
later on as well

739
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
so in this particular example this one

740
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,120
is related to the elastic search we are

741
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,600
going through the list of indices and if

742
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,679
look at the list of indices you can

743
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
clearly see there are a couple of

744
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,440
you know entries here

745
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
and if you look it in in a very detailed

746
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,600
manner you will try to see hey what

747
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,159
exactly this thing is like a random

748
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,880
string within a tag with the mail and it

749
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
is related to a list of other indexes

750
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
then you see another entry and then you

751
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,520
kept on seeing the other entry

752
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
so now what you want to take a look at

753
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,919
it let me grab all the entries that has

754
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,520
an email

755
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,840
this string identifier associated with

756
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
it so when we trigger that command that

757
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
you can clearly see there there were a

758
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
lot of indices that were available in

759
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,600
that compromised database that actually

760
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
highlighted

761
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
that this database is infected with

762
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,159
miyabar which means that

763
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,240
they have made the data completely

764
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
useless by encrypting it in a multiple

765
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
way so that you are still not able to

766
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,799
grasp that data back

767
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,120
but this is exactly you are picking all

768
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,039
this information sitting remotely

769
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,559
and now if we take an another example

770
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,000
of this thing to look it into a a bit of

771
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
more details

772
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
when you

773
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,159
this is an example i took it from

774
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,880
another elasticsearch uh you know

775
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
database which was infected

776
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,600
we try to go into all the indices and

777
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
then you know grabbing up that string so

778
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
you see a lot of entries here

779
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
and then you have like you know all that

780
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
related information you know stuff like

781
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,760
that so when you go into a detail of

782
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
that entry let's pick up annie and treat

783
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,480
this one and see how it looks like so

784
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,799
insidious you can clearly see you know

785
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,480
all the information that are available

786
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
like what is related to index creation

787
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,360
date

788
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,159
number of shots replicas uuid and things

789
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,679
like that

790
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,159
so this this way you can go in an

791
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
iterative manner

792
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
to dig more deep into it and try to

793
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
analyze what exactly it is all about but

794
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
this these examples sticking from the

795
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,679
real world

796
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,679
exactly highlighting how the infections

797
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,919
are happening

798
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,039
now let me

799
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,159
discuss a more example in a scenario

800
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,960
for the infected mongodb instance

801
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,880
so in this particular case when we're

802
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,000
waiting so as you all know mongodb you

803
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
actually have a

804
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
lot of collections in it right which is

805
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,320
associated with you know a database has

806
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,480
a lot of connect collections in it

807
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
so what exactly you have to do it you

808
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,600
have to enumerate all the databases

809
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,320
specific available in that instance and

810
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,640
then you go for every single collection

811
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,559
in that database

812
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,080
what happened in that case so you have

813
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,480
to enumerate each and every and then you

814
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
go to the level two to enumerate each

815
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
and every collection for

816
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
different set of signals that you can

817
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,039
extract and figure out okay this is

818
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,039
somewhat related to ransomware

819
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,600
so in this particular case as an example

820
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
you can clearly see in

821
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
we have a lot of collections and the

822
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,279
collections like system dot indices and

823
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,200
the interesting one is oh come on read

824
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,240
me

825
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,919
and when you say the name it says read

826
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
me to recover your data this actually

827
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
started highlighting there's some

828
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,399
problem associated with it and this

829
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,080
actually gives you the idea based on

830
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,399
intelligence like this mongodb is

831
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,880
potentially infected or the data is

832
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,559
being controlled by some sort of reserve

833
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,360
and similarly which we have seen as an

834
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,279
example in elasticsearch

835
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,600
we also want to take a look at it this

836
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
database which is infected

837
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,240
in this particular case this is also a

838
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,559
mongodb but this has like a lot of other

839
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,559
things available here which means the

840
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,799
indices and how it looks like although

841
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,600
these are green in nature but most of

842
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,679
these are kind of infected

843
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,159
with that so it highlights that in this

844
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,480
particular mongodb instance

845
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,399
the data is completely

846
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,200
corrupted and there's no way you can

847
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
get it back which means it falls into

848
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,159
the scenario of data destruction

849
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,799
which entails like whole database is now

850
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,960
corrupted there is no way you can get it

851
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,039
back if you don't have the backup it's a

852
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
problem

853
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
but this actually gives you the idea

854
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,080
where we have pick up two different

855
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,799
examples of ransom and meow bot and

856
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,440
mapping and map them to mongodb and

857
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,799
elasticsearch by analyzing real world

858
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,720
case studies how

859
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
these databases are getting infected in

860
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,080
cloud

861
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,039
so now before going further and

862
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,880
demonstrating and discussing about the

863
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
tools that we have designed i want to

864
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,200
discuss a very fantastic

865
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,159
real-world case study you know how cyber

866
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,120
wars are being done it is usually

867
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
these wars don't need to be between the

868
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
nation-states but they can be much more

869
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,440
focused and target between the

870
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
adversaries

871
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
and we can categorize adversaries good

872
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,519
or bad depending on the scenario but

873
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,679
less is between whiteheads and you know

874
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
the proper

875
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,360
attackers

876
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,039
so let's talk about it this will give

877
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,080
you a very interesting uh you know

878
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
understanding i would say like how these

879
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
wars are being fought

880
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,880
on the internet many of you might

881
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
already know about it but it will be

882
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,480
good to discuss it

883
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,399
so we came across when we're doing this

884
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,080
research and all this we came across

885
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,120
very

886
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,760
specific compromise elastic search and

887
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
mongodb instances where

888
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,679
when we analyzing the indices or

889
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,279
collections

890
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,039
we found that you know exactly there was

891
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,440
some specific company name is being used

892
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
and we were like kind of uh you know

893
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
amazed like why this was happening

894
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
so in this particular case you know

895
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,159
there is a one company associated which

896
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,919
is doing grand severe negotiations and

897
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,159
digital investigations

898
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,679
and they are providing very good set of

899
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,679
services based on what they do i'm not

900
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,279
going to go deep into you know the

901
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,679
practices they have but like they claim

902
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,120
you know they are going to help you in a

903
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,679
post breach scenario and help you to get

904
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
your data back by simply attacking

905
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,479
ransomware operators

906
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,840
now

907
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,399
this is an example of a compromised

908
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,480
elastic search instance

909
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
and if you look at it in this one you

910
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,159
can clearly see you know everything is

911
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,240
shallow and open which is okay

912
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,640
but then they are seeing read me hack by

913
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
nightline security and all those kind of

914
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,799
things you see similar random strings

915
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,880
here and all those kind of things but

916
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,279
the in this day the indices are being

917
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,360
encrypted but they are using the

918
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,399
identifier for that company i'm not

919
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,519
gonna

920
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
you know i did hide it because still

921
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,720
wanna

922
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,399
show that you know how these things are

923
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,240
happening in the wild

924
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
so this ransomware group compromises

925
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,039
exposed databases and alter the name of

926
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,720
indices to the name of a security

927
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
company and highlighting like you know

928
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
these are specifically you know these

929
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,200
are being managed

930
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,120
or the infections have been triggered by

931
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,720
this security company so it was like i

932
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
know a kind of like a cyber war an arms

933
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,159
race

934
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,079
but it was like a tough to predict what

935
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,560
exactly going on in the back end but

936
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,399
initially the idea was that you know the

937
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,079
events aware guys hey okay you give

938
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,839
these services we're to go utilize your

939
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,639
brand and do these kind of things

940
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,960
but this is a real world example that we

941
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
have seen in the while

942
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
so now in this particular example this

943
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
is for a compromised mongodb instance

944
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,918
but again if you look at the ransom

945
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,320
message it is pretty interesting

946
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,839
now these

947
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,839
read this message you will get an idea

948
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,679
hey we are ethical cybersecurity company

949
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,440
this and that all these kind of things

950
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,879
if you don't get your data back we'll

951
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,239
help you

952
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
but in fact what is happening

953
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
of course these companies providing that

954
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
kind of information are services but the

955
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
attackers or the ransomware operators

956
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,560
are also utilizing that

957
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
uh baselining information from this

958
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
company to actually

959
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,560
attack them indirectly

960
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,400
so ransomware group tried to put blame a

961
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,240
security company by injecting this and

962
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,760
that and those kind of

963
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
scenarios

964
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,119
so you can clearly see the world we are

965
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,880
living in you know the good

966
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,599
researchers are also fighting with the

967
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,280
adversaries

968
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,119
the way you actually define the

969
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,720
terminology

970
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
but the most important part in this case

971
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,800
is to understand you know when we really

972
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
need to build threat intelligence in

973
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,680
this space

974
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
how how critical we have to think about

975
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
it you know what exactly is going on you

976
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
know if the company is providing this

977
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,880
kind of service wire and somewhere

978
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,040
operators are going after them and you

979
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,680
see these kind of things out in the wild

980
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,119
pretty effectively

981
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,440
so when you build threat intelligence

982
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,200
you really need to make sure you filter

983
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
out the right artifacts so that the

984
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,520
intelligence can't be compromised in

985
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
that way as well but i want to highlight

986
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,359
it because this is a very important and

987
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,040
interesting case study so that you can

988
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,599
figure it out apart from the direct

989
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
targeted infections that are happening

990
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,480
in mongodb or elastic circumstances or

991
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,839
many more i'm not saying like the

992
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,720
couchdb or mysql are not untouched by it

993
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,040
our ongoing research is focused on mysql

994
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
and we're seeing a lot of

995
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,400
infections there as well

996
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
but this case study actually highlights

997
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,599
you know the fight between security

998
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,520
company and ransomware operators as well

999
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,119
and how it looks like in the wild

1000
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,760
similarly continuing on that you know we

1001
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
actually went ahead and looked into that

1002
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
as indices what exactly it is all about

1003
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
and all those kind of things to just

1004
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
figure it out how deep the

1005
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,839
problem is

1006
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
but this is a real world scenario it's

1007
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,760
happening in front of us and then we

1008
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,960
really need to you know

1009
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
accept that this is a problem and how we

1010
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,839
are going to solve it or at least reduce

1011
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,920
it to minimum to minimize the impact

1012
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,839
so now with that you know we did all

1013
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,599
those you know look into modern

1014
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,280
application architecture look into the

1015
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,359
root causes we looked into real world

1016
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,200
case studies you know how cloud

1017
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
databases are impacted

1018
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
i think it's a time

1019
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,119
what we have to do

1020
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,560
as a response

1021
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
so as a part of our research we

1022
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
developed two tools uh we named them as

1023
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
stratfor and amphilite the stratfor tool

1024
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,720
was designed and to actually

1025
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,920
detect potential infections in

1026
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,400
elastic search instances an enthalate

1027
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
tool is actually being defined designed

1028
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,680
to actually go

1029
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,240
finding security issues primarily random

1030
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,839
severe infections and meow body

1031
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,400
infections in mongodb

1032
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,800
so let's take a look at it

1033
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
if we look into the e and fill out so

1034
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
these are the different modules we have

1035
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,160
you know it gonna check the verification

1036
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,839
for different uh you know authentication

1037
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,200
and authorization

1038
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,680
is gonna help you dump info it are gonna

1039
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,040
help you to check whether you have an

1040
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,520
admin access one or the other way

1041
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
and then there are like four different

1042
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,520
modules here the basic check ransomware

1043
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
where it actually gonna trigger a simple

1044
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,880
query to get an idea did we see any in

1045
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,560
initial signals

1046
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,520
whether the

1047
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
mongodb is infected or then it goes for

1048
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,839
intrusive check as well

1049
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
so this is a layout how and fill out

1050
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,720
works

1051
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,560
and you can get an idea and you can

1052
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,040
utilize this tool enhance it

1053
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
uh because i'll share the links later on

1054
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,119
as well

1055
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,240
and

1056
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
how it works right so if you look at in

1057
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,320
this one i typically give an example of

1058
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
intrusic check transfer and i'll

1059
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,839
actually gonna have a proper demo as

1060
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,680
well for you all so that you can

1061
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
actually enjoy it and see it in the real

1062
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,760
world how it looks like but this is this

1063
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,480
output actually highlights how

1064
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
it works and how it's going to look into

1065
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
it so it's going to extract and run some

1066
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,599
of your message and things like that

1067
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,920
but it's like pretty interesting example

1068
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,359
and layout to see what it is all about

1069
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,920
similarly we have a stratfor tool it is

1070
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,560
focused on elastic search deployments

1071
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
again it's going to check you know

1072
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,119
ransomware infections myobot uh

1073
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,520
yes sunny underscore hp which means like

1074
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
it's going to detect

1075
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,160
honey pot which is yes sunny or esport

1076
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,720
honeypot it has the capability to detect

1077
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,800
it for example if you are going to scan

1078
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,280
elastic circumstances it will actually

1079
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
gives you the idea that rather you're

1080
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,280
scanning a real world instance which

1081
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
means like it's a real cloud instance

1082
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,800
exposed on the internet

1083
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,119
specific to an organization

1084
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,200
or you are actually scanning a

1085
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
honeypot

1086
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,960
we also have an updated version of

1087
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
stratfor tool which has like intrusive

1088
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
check and basic check which i'll show

1089
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,760
you a little later on as well

1090
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,160
and then if you look at the example like

1091
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,680
this uh

1092
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,599
so the tool is actually going after okay

1093
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,480
give me

1094
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,359
the ransomware

1095
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
output which means that you know

1096
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,839
we use ransomware module and check

1097
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,160
whether the remote elastic search engine

1098
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,400
and science is infected with

1099
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,119
that or not so when it runs properly

1100
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,440
against the things and patterns and all

1101
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,520
that it actually dumps you that which

1102
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
actually contains a ransom message as

1103
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,480
well

1104
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
and it it usually does it automatically

1105
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
everything is automated you have to just

1106
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,640
try it so with these two tools

1107
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,680
there are

1108
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760
you can utilize it in a multiple ways

1109
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,040
right you can

1110
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
use these tools

1111
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
to conduct proper track research you can

1112
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,200
use these tools in an automated way to

1113
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
launch scan and figure out

1114
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,960
if your own environment or on

1115
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,119
graduational environment is running

1116
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,560
these instances whether these are

1117
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
exposed or not

1118
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,280
and rather those instances are you know

1119
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,119
kind of thing infected with ransomware

1120
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,280
or other data destruction

1121
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
malware

1122
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,640
in addition to that you can also use

1123
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,280
this tool to add more modules

1124
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
to you know take it to the next level

1125
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,119
you can design wrapper functions around

1126
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,359
it you know specific to your own needs

1127
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,599
because the source code is available

1128
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,520
and the idea behind

1129
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,200
designing these tools is to share you

1130
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
know how as a collective community we

1131
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
can go after and you know combat

1132
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
ransomware and factions or data

1133
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,000
destruction malware that is targeting

1134
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,240
our critical assets in the cloud which

1135
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,880
are databases

1136
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,720
so with that let's take a look into the

1137
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,920
demonstration of these two tools and i

1138
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,160
have a recorded videos and it's going to

1139
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,319
run against you know live uh you know

1140
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,000
ips

1141
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
there are high possibility that those ip

1142
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,160
addresses or different cloud instances

1143
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,079
are not available anymore

1144
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,800
but you will have a good output in that

1145
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,960
case so let's take a look into this

1146
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,839
first example

1147
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,400
so we're using

1148
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
anfila tool and that it gives you the

1149
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
kind of different modules or

1150
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
stuff it has available

1151
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,280
so very first we are going to use basic

1152
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,960
check for detecting ransomware against a

1153
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,920
real world ip

1154
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,759
so let's take a look into it

1155
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
so when we

1156
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,920
ran this command against that so you can

1157
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,079
clearly see the output it is exactly

1158
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,319
showing okay mongodb is hosted on this

1159
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,920
with this

1160
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
port address where it is located and

1161
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,280
things like that

1162
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
but did you see we also see there is a

1163
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,920
one suspicious database just showing

1164
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,000
like readme to recover your data that's

1165
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
pretty interesting

1166
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,319
so with that we have to actually go

1167
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,400
ahead with the intrusive check let's

1168
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,839
take a look into it

1169
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,359
so when this tool ran now it gives you

1170
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
the idea

1171
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,520
that you know what kind of ransomware

1172
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,359
infection is being present in the

1173
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,359
targeted ip address here

1174
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,440
when i say targeted ib address basically

1175
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
the ip address of the cloud database

1176
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,200
instance

1177
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,079
and now you can get very determined

1178
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,000
output that hey this is infected and

1179
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,720
what we really need to do with that

1180
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,520
and similarly i'm just doing a read one

1181
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,400
again here so that you can get an idea

1182
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,839
again the basic check for the ransomware

1183
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,160
infection again it is impact you know

1184
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,319
working pretty fine and when you run

1185
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,000
again the intrusive check it gives you

1186
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,200
the very detailed response with that

1187
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
so this actually highlights how

1188
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,880
amphilite works in real time you can

1189
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,599
utilize this tool to actually conduct

1190
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,760
this kind of activity and

1191
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,480
and many others

1192
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
so now we are going to take a look into

1193
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,760
the staffer

1194
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,839
tool demo let's take a look into it

1195
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,440
so the idea in this case is to show

1196
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,680
how we can still detect infection in

1197
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,480
class elastic circumstances using this

1198
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,720
tool

1199
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,200
so this exactly show two modules which

1200
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
are like uh detecting the honeypot but

1201
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,160
what we are going to look into this case

1202
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
is

1203
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,880
one example here so this one is related

1204
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,800
to the elastic search you can clearly

1205
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,599
see the output is bit different here

1206
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,839
it is able to detect several patterns

1207
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,599
and then you know compute some score and

1208
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,280
then actually went ahead and actually

1209
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,800
dumped that message as well which is

1210
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,040
available in one of the plastic search

1211
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,200
indices

1212
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,319
similarly you can get a whole idea

1213
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,319
and you can imagine you don't have to do

1214
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,079
anything different here you have to use

1215
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,200
the tool

1216
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,040
run it against your elastic such

1217
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,680
instances and try to determine that and

1218
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,599
even for that research you can do you

1219
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,000
know define a wrapper and you know

1220
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
utilize this tool to you know use it

1221
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,240
within a mass scanning as well uh if you

1222
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,880
want to to just get an idea what kind of

1223
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,839
infections are being seen

1224
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,359
so now in this example or a

1225
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,560
demo what we are trying to see the

1226
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,359
canva tool in action again but this time

1227
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,200
the tool is going to

1228
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,560
detect

1229
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,040
neon bot in factions

1230
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,720
so we have two

1231
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,720
modules here basic checks for meowbot

1232
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
and intrusive check for nearby and we

1233
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,800
are going to run it against the real

1234
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,040
world

1235
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
instance and now you can clearly see

1236
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,839
when you did the basic check it is

1237
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,599
actually going through every single

1238
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,760
power like collection or database that

1239
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,000
is available and then try to figure out

1240
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,800
what exactly it is all about so when it

1241
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
went through all the databases that were

1242
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,240
available

1243
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,800
and enumerated you could have seen that

1244
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,640
it is actually going through the objects

1245
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,880
collections and everything

1246
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,000
but

1247
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,680
this is the basic check so you can

1248
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,000
exactly kind of go after and do the

1249
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,040
intrusive check as well

1250
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,560
let's take a output of the intrusive

1251
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,640
check

1252
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,000
it's going to start the loop it's going

1253
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,920
to go to every single database all the

1254
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,760
collections and you can keep on dumping

1255
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,520
what is associated with it and things

1256
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,000
like that object ids and all so this

1257
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,960
actually

1258
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,599
helps you to gather more information but

1259
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,200
even at this point of time you are

1260
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,760
pretty much sure the remote database the

1261
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,960
cloud instances infected with

1262
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,760
myobar so this was the example of that

1263
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,400
so with that uh

1264
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,079
there are certain things that we really

1265
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,160
need to look into

1266
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,040
as this as a whole research

1267
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,880
so we want to conclude and you know

1268
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,960
infer at a certain point so that we can

1269
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,720
actually get an idea like where this

1270
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,680
research

1271
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,359
you know why we started this research

1272
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,880
where it is leading and what is an

1273
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,920
outcome

1274
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,680
so we understand the whole new posture

1275
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,640
of modern applications cloud databases

1276
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,160
threats that are residing in cloud

1277
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,520
databases

1278
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,240
infection root causes you know how the

1279
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
real world looks like you know in

1280
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,920
factions that we have seen and the tools

1281
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,839
that we have

1282
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
designed but in order to just get to the

1283
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,400
pinpoint we really need to understand

1284
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,920
and adhere

1285
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
to the reality of this world which means

1286
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,680
like ransomware attacks are causing

1287
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,880
serious disruptions to the businesses

1288
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,720
we really need to find a way to handle

1289
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
these attacks proactively when i say

1290
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
proactively which means like you know we

1291
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,480
need to have a defense and depth

1292
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
mechanism in place but we really need

1293
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,960
additional custom controls

1294
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,800
that are specific to the organizational

1295
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,440
environment including educating end

1296
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,839
users to handle these attacks more

1297
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,240
proactively

1298
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,640
there should be a dire need for

1299
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,480
conduct conducting regular security

1300
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,800
posture assessment for different

1301
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,839
resources on the infrastructure

1302
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,760
whether it's in a cloud or on-premise

1303
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,119
there shouldn't be a way like you're

1304
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,040
doing a penetration testing for you know

1305
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
365 days so one time and then you are

1306
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,440
okay no it has to be week basis weekly

1307
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,480
basis has to be the monthly basis

1308
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
we really need we are in a world where

1309
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,400
we are dealing with the scalable

1310
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,280
platforms where a lot of data resides we

1311
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,119
are ingesting a lot of data so we have

1312
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,440
to harness the power of artificial

1313
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,599
intelligence or machine learning to

1314
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
detect anomalies

1315
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,359
and then having hybrid systems to use

1316
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,520
signatures as well to ensure

1317
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,280
we are actually detecting

1318
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,760
a kind of needle in a haystack

1319
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
right

1320
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,720
if you're deploying cloud databases you

1321
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
have to go after building a

1322
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,440
hard security configuration there should

1323
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,000
be a policy which actually talks about

1324
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
in the organization if you really need

1325
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,480
to deploy cloud instances or databases

1326
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,079
there should be astringent security

1327
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,040
check that should be available

1328
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,359
before these

1329
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,680
resources are being deployed

1330
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
of course maintain the cloud

1331
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,440
hygiene for databases very very

1332
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,680
important you know patch one abilities

1333
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,359
making sure that you should not waste

1334
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,079
time in patching the critical resources

1335
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,760
that are required

1336
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
uh in your organizations typically

1337
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,359
software specific or even hardware

1338
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,800
specific as well

1339
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,319
so overall one security controls

1340
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,640
or or you can say one set of security

1341
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,720
controls cannot

1342
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,119
serve this purpose there are multiple

1343
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,880
set of security controls need to work

1344
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,520
together in conjunction to fight against

1345
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,720
these threats

1346
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,160
because these are very advanced threats

1347
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,559
so advanced security techniques and

1348
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,280
tactics are required as well

1349
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,240
so with that there is a tools repository

1350
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
available uh you can see that you know

1351
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,559
on the github and fill out software you

1352
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,839
can get it here

1353
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,839
how we have developed this tool and all

1354
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,960
that

1355
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,079
and

1356
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,960
with that uh thank you very much and i

1357
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,760
really appreciate uh for attending this

1358
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,880
talk

1359
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,079
and you know taking time out hopefully

1360
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,240
we have shared and learned together the

1361
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,440
new things

1362
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,359
hope this research gonna be

1363
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,680
very useful to you

1364
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,240
more feedback is welcome feel free to

1365
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,880
you know contact and talk about it

1366
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,520
i'll be more than happy to

1367
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,040
work with that

1368
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,680
again i will be i'm very thankful to the

1369
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,520
whole scary communi

1370
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,640
community

1371
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
and you know giving me this opportunity

1372
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,319
to talk about it thank you very much

1373
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,160
really appreciate that

1374
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,800
thank you aditya uh we have time for

1375
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
maybe one question if anyone in the room

1376
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
has a question

1377
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,920
sure

1378
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,440
all right we have we have one question

1379
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,119
to the matrix chat

1380
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,520
um would such ransomware and cloud db

1381
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,760
attacks be mitigated if the applications

1382
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,680
employ multi-tier architecture where

1383
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,440
only the web server can talk to the app

1384
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,280
server and only the app server can talk

1385
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,599
to the database so the database is not

1386
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,079
directly exposed to the internet

1387
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,720
absolutely i think

1388
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,880
i think that the way caution is asked it

1389
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,800
actually highlighting the solution as

1390
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
well see that's where the defense and

1391
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,119
depth mechanism comes to play right

1392
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,079
we

1393
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,800
as a part of the designing when we're

1394
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,640
designing security controls these are

1395
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
the most important part right

1396
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
why you really need to give a more

1397
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,640
exposure to the critical services when

1398
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,160
they are not required when the

1399
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,920
application server need to talk to the

1400
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,839
database there should be a proper

1401
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,440
security controls

1402
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,200
filters are in place

1403
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,520
that should be defined right away at the

1404
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,000
time of deployment so that unnecessary

1405
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,559
exposure can be curtailed right why you

1406
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,640
really need to have your cloud databases

1407
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,079
exposed on the internet what is the

1408
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,680
purpose behind it

1409
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,400
this is happening because people are

1410
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,960
there away we are either having you know

1411
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,880
issues by defining

1412
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,480
hardline

1413
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,160
hardening guidelines

1414
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
also we are also in a process of having

1415
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,079
a lot of errors because we want to

1416
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,680
deploy the things without checking the

1417
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,920
configuration we are not looking into

1418
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,079
the alerts and things like that

1419
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,800
but in reality everybody is not used to

1420
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,960
this kind of advanced technologies

1421
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,559
right that's where the technology

1422
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,079
experts the developers the

1423
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,160
administrators need to play a very vital

1424
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,720
role ensuring that these kind of

1425
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,920
critical

1426
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,319
resources when deployed they should

1427
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,880
stick to a specific set of controls

1428
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,640
otherwise it's a tough and it's a

1429
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,839
nightmare

1430
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,319
we are living in people call us oh this

1431
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,480
is a fur this is not fear uncertainty

1432
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,880
doubt this is a reality and we have gone

1433
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,720
through several cases through it and

1434
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,440
that's the way we say security design

1435
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
before even exactly the deployment is

1436
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,680
done is the most important aspect so

1437
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,520
that people have an idea when they

1438
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,760
really need to define or deploy these

1439
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,559
things

1440
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,040
they do that properly

1441
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,480
all right thank you so much for your

1442
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,839
talk of each and thank you for the

1443
