00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
or talk to any of the crew staff and let

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,080
them know that you're interested in

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
helping

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
and with that let's jump into our last

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,319
talk

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
it is from corey doctorow renowned

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
author activist and journalist who cares

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
deeply about how technology impacts

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,879
people

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
some of his recent works include little

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,599
brother

48
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
how to destroy surveillance capitalism

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
the graphic novel in real life and the

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,519
soon to be released checkpoint

51
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,160
capitalism coming out in september

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,319
his talk is titled seize the means of

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,879
computation how interoperability can

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,120
take the internet back from big tech and

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,200
it focuses on what big tech fears the

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
most technology operated by and for the

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
people who use it

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
if you have any questions during cory's

59
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
chat talk you can submit them to the

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
dedicated matrix chat channel we will

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
ask as many of them as time will allow

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
during the qa slot at the end of the

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,720
session and now over to you corey

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
well thank you very much uh what a treat

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
to be here i was virtually present for

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
the last one of these hopes and i had

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
very much hoped to be there in person

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
this time however it overlapped with um

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
the first family vacation i've had with

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
my distant relatives uh the first chance

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
to see my niece and nephew in three

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
years so i hope you'll agree that that

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,080
was a good reason

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
to miss this

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
and i did spend the last two weeks on a

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
beach preparing i read my entire backlog

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
of 2600 magazines that had piled up but

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
that i hadn't had a chance to read so

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
i'm fresh off reading literally two

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
years worth of 2600s back to back and

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,159
and ready to go and looking forward to

82
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
seeing as many of you as i can in person

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,680
the next time one of these happens

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
because i i really do

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
enjoy hope and i'm jealous of you all

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,599
there in person uh exchanging microbes

87
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,120
with one another

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,560
so this is not a talk for people who

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
want to uh rather this is a talk for

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
people who want to destroy big tech this

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
is not a talk for people who want to

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
tame big tech there is no fixing big

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,959
tech

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
it's also not a talk for people who want

95
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
to get rid of technology itself

96
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,120
technology is not the problem stop

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
thinking about what technology does

98
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,639
and start thinking about what technology

99
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,040
about who technology does it to

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,600
and who technology does it for

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
this is a talk as you heard

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,440
about the thing that big tech fears the

103
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
most

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
technology operated by and for

105
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
the people who use it

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
today's tech barons are not evil

107
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120
geniuses they're not evil their

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
ambitions to world domination are not

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
novel nor are they especially grandiose

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
the founders of alta vista and dec and

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
sun microsystems and commodore all talk

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,080
the same line about taking over the

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
world about being in charge of our

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
future

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
the difference is all of those guys they

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
didn't get it

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
but today's tech leaders they're also

118
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,800
not geniuses

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
the reason the tech industry spent

120
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
generations churning as new companies

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
and new systems supplanted the old was

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
that in the olden days we enforced

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
competition rules and that made sure

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
that this could happen

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
like we used to ban companies from

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
buying their competitors we used to ban

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,639
them from creating vertical monopolies

128
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
the new crop of leaders aren't being

129
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,639
displaced it's true right mark

130
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
zuckerberg has been on the top of the

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
dog pile for a lot longer than the

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
founders of silicon graphics but that's

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
not because of his incredible leadership

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,199
and journalism and and vision

135
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
it's because 40 years ago we shot

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
antitrust law in the guts and we let

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
companies led by mediocre idiots

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
no better than their forebears

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,919
establish monopolies

140
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,720
these donkeys are able to parlay those

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,600
monopoly winnings into policies that

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
prevent new technologies and new

143
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
companies from supplanting theirs

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
they get to decide who can compete with

145
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,319
them and how they can compete

146
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,880
notably today's tech giants are able to

147
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
wield the law against inter-operators

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
that's the new technologies that plug

149
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
into their existing services systems and

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
platforms and that is a privilege that

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
none of yesterday's easily toppled

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
giants had

153
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,919
you know ibm did not like the fact that

154
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,600
its competitors made software and

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
printers and keyboards and storage for

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
its mainframes but to stop them from

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
doing that it had to try to build a

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
computer that no one else could reverse

159
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,120
engineer and improve on and for complex

160
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
reasons that i think this audience

161
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
probably understands pretty well

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
this is impossible

163
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
the very bedrock of computer science

164
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
ideas named for mid-century computing

165
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
demigods like touring completeness and

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
von neumann machines

167
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
dictates that the creation of

168
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,479
non-interoperable computers is a fool's

169
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,599
errand

170
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
it's fantasy it's not science fiction

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,479
it's like a time machine or a faster

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,880
than light drive a thought experiment

173
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
not something anyone's ever going to be

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,479
able to build

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,479
today's tech giants have not invented

176
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,240
interoperability proof computers

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
instead

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
they've invented laws that make

179
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
interoperability illegal

180
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
unless they give permission for it they

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
created a new complex thicket of

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
copyright patent trade secret

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
non-compete and other ip rights that

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
combined conjure up a new offense that

185
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
we could think of as

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,080
felony contempt of business model the

187
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,639
right of large companies to dictate how

188
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
their customers their competitors even

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
their critics can use their products

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
now why have tech firms gone to war

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
against interoperability why do they

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,319
fear interoperability so much

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,879
the answer is simple it's all about

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
switching costs

195
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
whenever economists gather to hand wave

196
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
away the rise of big tech as

197
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
historically inevitable they make

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
frequent reference to the idea of

199
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
network effects

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,039
this is an economist term of art for a

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
product that gets more valuable every

202
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
time it wins a new customer like you

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
joined facebook to chat with the people

204
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
who are already there they had made it

205
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
valuable for you to join and then once

206
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,319
you joined facebook got more valuable

207
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
because other people joined because you

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
were there

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
network effects are there network

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
effects are indeed how big tech gets big

211
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,399
but switching costs are how big tech

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,559
stays big

213
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
switching costs that's the stuff that

214
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
you have to give up when you stop using

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
a product or service like if you quit

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,080
facebook you lose the family photos

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
you've uploaded you lose access to the

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
friends the family the community the

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,519
customers you go there to hang out with

220
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
and talk to

221
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
when switching costs are high enough

222
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
people keep using products and services

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
even when they hate the products and

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
services

225
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
so long as the pain of staying is less

226
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
than the pain of leaving the users stay

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,800
so

228
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
this is not actually in my speech notes

229
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
but

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
it's just occurred to me that this is a

231
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,800
way to think about the um the

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,680
the shibboleth or the idea that our

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
technology is addictive i understand why

234
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
people say technology is addictive after

235
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
all if someone is using facebook every

236
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
day and talking about how much they hate

237
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
facebook

238
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
they kind of sound like a smoker who's

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
talking about how much they hate

240
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
cigarettes while lighting another one

241
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
and so maybe you could call this

242
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
addictive but i don't think addiction is

243
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
the right model here i think you can

244
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
understand this as switching costs like

245
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,640
addiction is a kind of switching cost

246
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
you know speaking as someone who used to

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
smoke a lot and who gave it up there's a

248
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
really high switching cost to giving up

249
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,720
cigarettes right it's not just uh you

250
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
know losing the instant ability to meet

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
friends uh out by the dumpster where

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
they banish you to have a cigarette it's

253
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
also you know the physical withdrawal

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
from from not smoking those switching

255
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
costs are really high

256
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
and and it hurts to quit smoking and it

257
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
hurts to quit facebook not because

258
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
facebook is great

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
and you know quitting cigarettes it

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
doesn't hurt because cigarettes are

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,000
great it hurts because the people you

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
leave behind

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
are stuck there and you lose some of

264
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
your social relation to them it's that

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
high switching cost i think that the

266
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
narrative that technology is addictive

267
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
serves technology

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,800
companies right if you're going out

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
there and pitching a venture capitalist

270
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
or private equity fund and you can say

271
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
look i'm going to invent something as

272
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
addictive as a jewel pod

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
it's going to be in social media form

274
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
then yeah they're going to want to

275
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,519
invest in you because they like that

276
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,560
idea

277
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
but it's not really that they're making

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
it addictive it's that they're trapping

279
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,200
the people you want to talk to inside a

280
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
walled garden

281
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
so that was all adelaide but wasn't in

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
my talk notes i hope it makes sense

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
normally i practice this stuff but i

284
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,959
just had this idea as i was talking to

285
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,720
you i'm gonna go back to the regularly

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
scheduled talk here they told me i had

287
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
longer than i thought i would so i'm a

288
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
little giddy with the power of being

289
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,519
able to run along here

290
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
so when switching costs are high enough

291
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
people keep using products and services

292
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
even though they hate the products and

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
services so long as the pain of staying

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
is less than the pain of leaving the

295
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
users will stay

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
that means that when companies can raise

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
their switching costs they also get to

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
treat their customers worse and still

299
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
keep their business that is to say they

300
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
can shift value from the customers to

301
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,839
their shareholders without worrying

302
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,839
about the customers leaving because the

303
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
customers will have to pay such a high

304
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
price to go that they'll stay even when

305
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
they think it's unfair

306
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
and the corollary of this is that if you

307
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,440
can make switching costs lower you force

308
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
companies to treat you better if they

309
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
want to keep your business

310
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
you know if the users who quit facebook

311
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,519
who resigned their account and deleted

312
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,279
the app could still talk to their

313
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
facebook friends through another service

314
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
a rival service that could interchange

315
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
messages with facebook facebook would be

316
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
in serious trouble

317
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,000
and interoperability is the way that we

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
lower switching costs interoperability

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
is what allows us the users of

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
technology to set the terms on which we

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,720
use that technology it allows us to use

322
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
the parts of the products and services

323
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,440
that benefit us and also block the parts

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,360
that hurt us that don't benefit us that

325
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
we don't like

326
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
there are a lot of things we should do

327
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,279
to fix big tech we should change the

328
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
rules for mergers and actually the ftc

329
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,040
is doing that we should pass

330
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
comprehensive privacy legislation that

331
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
looks like it might be dead in congress

332
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
we should ban deceptive dark practices

333
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
and of course we should break up these

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
giant companies into smaller competing

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
firms but that stuff

336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
it takes a long time like

337
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
i think we under-appreciate just how

338
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
long it takes like we think about att as

339
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
being broken up after a seven-year

340
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
lawsuit that was just the latest attempt

341
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
by the doj to break up att if you start

342
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
from the first antitrust action filed

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
against the bell system to the day it

344
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,279
was broken up in 1982 that was a process

345
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,760
that took 69 years we don't have 69

346
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,639
years

347
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
to fix the internet

348
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
by contrast interoperability is

349
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
immediate if you make it legal for new

350
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
technologies to plug into existing ones

351
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,320
that is if you make it legal to blast

352
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
holes in every walled garden the users

353
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
that's us

354
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
we get immediate profound relief relief

355
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,320
from manipulation from high-handed

356
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
moderation from surveillance from price

357
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
gouging from disgusting or misleading

358
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
algorithmic suggestions that whole

359
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,839
panoply of technology sins

360
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
now i'm going to go into what i mean by

361
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
interoperability the different kinds of

362
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
interoperability from widely adopted

363
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
formal standards to the guerrilla

364
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
warfare of reverse engineering and i'll

365
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
touch on the legislative and judicial

366
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
history of the war on interop and i'll

367
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
describe a diversity of tactics

368
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
commercial legal technological and

369
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
social that we can use to foster

370
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
interoperability

371
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
i'll explain how a well-constructed

372
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,199
interoperability policy can be sturdy

373
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,199
enough to beat the attacks against that

374
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,959
whether they are legal or technical or

375
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,959
social or commercial

376
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
these are shovel-ready ideas these are a

377
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
means to dismantle big text control over

378
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
our digital lives and devolve control to

379
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,199
the people who suffer the most under the

380
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,839
hegemony of big tech the marginalized

381
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,800
users the low-level tech workers and the

382
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
people who live downstream of tax

383
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,360
exhaust plume the people choking on

384
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
toxic waste from the tech industry and

385
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
the people living under dictatorships

386
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
where control is maintained with

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
off-the-shelf cyber weapons used to hunt

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,600
and neutralize opposition figures

389
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
so let's start with how big tech got big

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
and to understand how big tech got big

391
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,959
we have to understand the history of

392
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
competition law in the u.s

393
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,040
so in the u.s the first competition laws

394
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
to get past the sherman anti-trust act

395
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
in 1890 they were passed on the idea

396
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,519
that there was something dangerous about

397
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
companies being big

398
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
that once a company attained a certain

399
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
scale a certain degree of profitability

400
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
it became effectively impossible to

401
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
regulate them that they became something

402
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
like a king

403
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
and you know in that when john sherman

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
the senator whose name is on the sherman

405
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
act the first antitrust law when he was

406
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
trying to convince his fellow senators

407
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
to pass the law he gave a speech where

408
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,800
he said we wouldn't suffer a king

409
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,440
just to tell us how to live our lives we

410
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,320
should not suffer a king of industry who

411
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
tells us how to live our lives and so

412
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,040
this harmful dominance idea became the

413
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,759
the pole star of american competition

414
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,000
law uh something that was used to break

415
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,240
up uh the standard oil company john d

416
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
rockefeller's empire of uh both oil

417
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,560
refineries and oil pipelines and oil uh

418
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
wells but also the banks and the

419
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
railroads and the shipping lines that

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,639
did all of the oil marketing all of that

421
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
stuff was under one company's control

422
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
and he used that to structure really

423
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,399
control over

424
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
what amounted to the destiny of the

425
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,040
nation

426
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
and so it was the sherman act and its

427
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
successors like the clayton act that

428
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,959
were used to break up the standard oil

429
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,079
company

430
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,639
not because it was bad at making oil not

431
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,320
because it didn't make oil cheap there

432
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
was lots of evidence that in places

433
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
where the standard oil company reigned

434
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
supreme they could create all kinds of

435
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
efficiencies and lower the cost of oil

436
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
but because it was dangerous to let one

437
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,079
unelected unaccountable man this king of

438
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
industry john d rockefeller often drawn

439
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
in the editorial cartoons of the day

440
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
wearing a crown it was dangerous to let

441
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,120
him rule that it was antithetical to

442
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
democracy

443
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
and that was the basis for american

444
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,119
antitrust law until the late 1970s

445
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,880
it actually became the basis for

446
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,599
competition law all around the world um

447
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
you may know that after world war ii the

448
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
us went to europe and under the

449
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,400
guidance of the marshall plan

450
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
helped draft the new laws for post-war

451
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
europe which included laws that looked a

452
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
lot like american antitrust laws and

453
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,360
held to the same standard this idea that

454
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
dominance itself was harmful and the

455
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
thing about

456
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
harmful dominance as a standard

457
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
is it really gave standing to everybody

458
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
who might want to talk about how a

459
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,080
company's behavior was hurting it right

460
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
if you were a worker at that company

461
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
where it was the only employer in town

462
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,360
and you had to accept bad working

463
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
conditions or low pay because there was

464
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
nowhere else to go you had standing

465
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
under this harmful dominance standard to

466
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,600
ask a regulator to intervene same if you

467
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,919
lived in the town and its pollution was

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,160
harming you and you couldn't get the

469
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
town uh council to do something about it

470
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
because as the only company in town the

471
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
town council was under its thumb you

472
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,480
also had sten you had staining as its

473
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
customers you had standings as its

474
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
suppliers if they said we're gonna pay

475
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
you less for your inputs to our

476
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,360
manufacturing process than it costs you

477
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
to make them and since we're the only

478
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
game in town

479
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,440
you're

480
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
you're going to have to suck it up and

481
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,600
find some way to make a go of it you

482
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
also had standing to to seek redress for

483
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
this and so this became the model for a

484
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
long time it meant that any time a

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
company got too big for its britches any

486
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
of the people who its dominance harmed

487
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
was able to show up and ask a regulator

488
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
to do something about it and then came

489
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
the 1970s and in the 1970s we saw the

490
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
rise of what had been a very fringe

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
theory of antitrust suddenly come to the

492
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,200
fore

493
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
this theory was promulgated by a jurist

494
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
called robert bork

495
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
a lot of people don't remember him these

496
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,120
days he was nixon's solicitor general

497
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
and was so complicit in nixon's crimes

498
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
that when reagan tried to make him a

499
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
supreme court judge he completely blew

500
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,120
the

501
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
the confirmation hearing if you've ever

502
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,440
heard the term to be borked that's what

503
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,280
it's about it's about robert bork

504
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
showing up in in in front of the senate

505
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
and just like covering himself in shame

506
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
and trying to defend his actions under

507
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,400
nixon

508
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
robert bork didn't make it onto the

509
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
supreme court but he actually had a much

510
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
bigger effect on our society than he

511
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
would have if he'd merely served in the

512
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,840
highest court for the rest of his life

513
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,160
and that was because he was able to

514
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
promulgate a weird legal theory that he

515
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,880
had come up with at the university of

516
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
chicago school of economics which is

517
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
really the kind of cradle of modern

518
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,480
hyper capitalism what we call

519
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
neoliberalism

520
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
and this theory it's called the consumer

521
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
welfare theory of antitrust

522
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
and it's both an economic theory and

523
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
kind of a conspiracy theory

524
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
he said that although

525
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
the text of the sherman act and the

526
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
clayton act and the ftc act and the

527
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
other antitrust laws although these were

528
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,480
were really like obviously about harmful

529
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,640
dominance and although the the people

530
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
whose names were on them like like

531
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
senator sherman

532
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
stood in front of the entire u.s senate

533
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
and gave speeches explaining what he

534
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
meant by his law

535
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,679
that actually we'd misread the law all

536
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
this time that the true meaning of

537
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
antitrust like the true meaning of

538
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,120
christmas the true meaning of antitrust

539
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,480
was to promote

540
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
consumer welfare

541
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
and what he meant by consumer welfare

542
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,159
was that

543
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,159
he felt that it was important that

544
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,320
america make policy

545
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
that fought monopolies

546
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,600
only

547
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
if they would raise prices or lower

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
quality that unless a monopoly was

549
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
raising prices or lowering quality that

550
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
not only should we keep our mitts off of

551
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,120
it not bring antitrust action against it

552
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
but we should actually celebrate it as a

553
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,159
kind of efficient system

554
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,559
you may recognize that rhetoric right

555
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
why do people say amazon is good well

556
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
look at how efficiently it ships things

557
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
to you why do people say apple's walled

558
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
garden is good look at how efficiently

559
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
everything just works together that was

560
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,880
the idea that if we allowed monopolies

561
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
free reign that the people who ran them

562
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
these extraordinary geniuses who had the

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,120
great uh foresight to build these

564
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
empires of the sort that john d

565
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000
rockefeller had been unjustly deprived

566
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
of with the breakup of the standard oil

567
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
company that that we could

568
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,000
reap the benefits as consumers

569
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,480
in the form of cheaper goods that were

570
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
of higher quality

571
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,679
and that um it was far more common that

572
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,480
a monopoly was good then it was bad and

573
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
if we ever tried to do something about a

574
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,919
monopoly we would probably end up

575
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
shooting ourselves in the foot by

576
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
undermining this consumer welfare

577
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
now on its face consumer welfare makes a

578
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,320
certain kind of sense you can kind of

579
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
see how people would say all right well

580
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
yeah it's it's it's an empirical

581
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,280
standard if so long as like a company

582
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
isn't raising prices we'll leave it

583
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
alone and when it does raise prices we

584
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,679
will but not so fast because when when

585
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,320
uh when bork and his pals at the

586
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,520
university of chicago school of

587
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
economics talked about raising prices

588
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
following a merger or following an

589
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,240
acquisition or after some

590
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
anti-competitive conduct

591
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,679
they didn't mean

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,200
you know

593
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
one company buys its major rivals and

594
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,760
the price goes up they said well

595
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
you know sometimes a company buys its

596
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
major rival and the price goes up

597
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,760
because oil went up or labor costs went

598
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,080
up or other key inputs went up or you

599
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
know like the moon is in venus or

600
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
whatever like there could be some

601
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,919
exogenous reason some external reason

602
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,760
that drove up the prices he said you

603
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
need to

604
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
make sure

605
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,240
that if prices go up following a merger

606
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,919
or some anti-competitive conduct or an

607
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,679
acquisition you need to make sure that

608
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,240
it was because of that and the only way

609
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,320
to be sure is to build these very

610
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,559
complex ornate very abstract

611
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
mathematical models that were invented

612
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,400
at the university of chicago and that

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
only

614
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
economists from the university of

615
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
chicago knew how to make and that they

616
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
would make for money right if you were

617
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
gonna buy your major competitor you

618
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
could hire a university of chicago

619
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,039
economist to build a model that proved

620
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
that it would make prices go up and then

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,159
if after buying your major competitor

622
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
you doubled your prices

623
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
you could hire that economist again to

624
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,000
build another model to prove

625
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,080
that um the prices went up for some

626
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,919
other reason and that you should be left

627
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,240
alone so this was kind of a

628
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
kind of learned helplessness for

629
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
antitrust regulators that really what

630
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
they did

631
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,080
was they kind of transformed themselves

632
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
these university of chicago economists

633
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,159
transformed themselves into kind of

634
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,919
court sorcerers

635
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
for the american business lobby

636
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
where if if you were upset

637
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
that um a merger was taking place or

638
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
that a company was doing something

639
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,880
anti-competitive or that after a merger

640
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
prices went up or the company started

641
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
abusing its suppliers or its workers um

642
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
you could you could go and petition for

643
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
redress in front of the regulator but

644
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
the court sorcerer would be there this

645
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,520
this university of chicago economist and

646
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
he would you would give your case you'd

647
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
make your case and then he would drag a

648
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
goat

649
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,919
into the court

650
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
and he would slice it open spread its

651
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
guts out on the floor of the court

652
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
before the king and the courtiers and he

653
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
would stare at the guts and he would

654
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
stroke his beard and he would say you

655
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,120
know

656
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
i've looked in these guts and i have to

657
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,600
tell you

658
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,120
that you're wrong

659
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,919
um

660
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,600
everything is fine

661
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,760
and the thing you're seeking this this

662
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
neutering of this this corporate

663
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
behemoth it wouldn't help you

664
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,000
and if you had the temerity

665
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,080
to peer over this court sorcerer's

666
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
shoulders and say you know i'm looking

667
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,760
at these guts and i just don't see that

668
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,240
he could go

669
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,000
look who thinks he knows how to read the

670
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,840
guts of a goat did you go to the

671
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
university of chicago school of

672
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,640
economics

673
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,159
so as a result

674
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880
you saw 40 years of antitrust

675
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
forbearance ronald reagan was in love

676
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
with this theory so was margaret

677
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,760
thatcher so were european neoliberals of

678
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,720
the day like uh helmut cole the canadian

679
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,200
leader uh brian mulroney they all

680
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
adopted this idea that the true meaning

681
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,080
of antitrust was preserving consumer

682
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
welfare which is to say doing nothing

683
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
and doing nothing for 40 years about

684
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
monopoly formation and maintenance led

685
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,919
to

686
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,799
monopolies surprise surprise

687
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,600
today practically every industry you

688
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,799
care to name

689
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,080
is concentrated into four or five hands

690
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
you know all the beer you drink is made

691
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
by one of two companies all the spirits

692
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,520
you drink is made by one of two

693
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
companies uh all the wrestling you watch

694
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,400
is run by one uh company you know

695
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
founded and run by this kind of rapey

696
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,960
weirdo just had to resign who bought all

697
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
of his competitors and then uh

698
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
reclassified his employees the

699
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,919
performers who do the work of wrestling

700
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,760
as contractors so he could take away

701
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,440
their medical insurance which is why if

702
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,679
you go on gofundme all the wrestlers you

703
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,440
grew up watching are now they're begging

704
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,760
for pennies to help cover their medical

705
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,679
bills well so they can die with dignity

706
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,520
of their work-related injuries in their

707
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
50s

708
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,039
every industry looks like the tech

709
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,760
industry there's one company that makes

710
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,279
all the eyeglasses company called

711
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
luxxotica esselor a merger of a giant

712
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,039
french company in a giant italian

713
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,080
company

714
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,559
every lens you've uh ever had in your

715
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,559
glasses chances are was made in an slr

716
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
lab they make more than 50 of the lenses

717
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,360
in the world every frame you've ever had

718
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
probably came from luxxotica they own

719
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,559
every brand from coach to dolce gabbana

720
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
to bausch

721
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,080
they own

722
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,159
every retailer you might have shopped at

723
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,480
uh they own sunglass hut they own

724
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,360
lens crafters um and and also they own

725
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
the largest insurer so even if you went

726
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,159
to like a hipster indie optometrist who

727
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,720
like nod your glasses frames out of a

728
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,279
log with his own teeth the insurance

729
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
bill was covered by luxottica esselor

730
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
you can't escape them and of course

731
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
they've raised the prices on glasses a

732
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
thousand percent in the last 10 years

733
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
they stole your eyes

734
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
and it's not just them finance industry

735
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
looks like that shipping shipping is run

736
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,000
by four giant cartels and you know when

737
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,399
a company is that big harmful dominance

738
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,559
no one can tell them what to do

739
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,360
because uh they're so big that they just

740
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,799
ignore you and so for like 15 years

741
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,480
regulators and experts have been saying

742
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,919
you know you keep building these ships

743
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,279
bigger and bigger because you get these

744
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,360
economies of scale on diesel fuel when

745
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,600
you make the container ship bigger but

746
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,039
eventually one of these is going to get

747
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,039
stuck in the suez canal and they were

748
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,080
like

749
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
what do you know about shipping

750
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,919
so much

751
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
of the dysfunction in our lives boils

752
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,279
down to

753
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,640
four

754
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
incredibly powerful people usually dudes

755
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
run the entire industry and they don't

756
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
listen to anyone they just do what's

757
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,440
good for them

758
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
[Music]

759
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,679
so yeah on the one hand

760
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,679
tech is not exceptional

761
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,480
tech

762
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,520
this the structure of tech the economics

763
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,480
of tech this winner-take-all function of

764
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
tech it looks like the running shoe

765
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
market it looks like the beer market it

766
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
looks like the cheerleader uniform

767
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,840
market it looks like the horse show

768
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
market it looks like every other

769
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
industry that has been cornered but tech

770
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,159
is different in some really important

771
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,279
ways

772
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,039
tech is different

773
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,159
because

774
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
it has network effects now lots of

775
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,600
industries have network effects but not

776
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
like tech tech has network effects on

777
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,919
steroids like if you're old you might

778
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,360
remember like

779
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,760
one person sent a hotmail message to

780
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,679
india that said like get a free email

781
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
account and then like within a couple of

782
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,559
weeks

783
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
some gigantic number of people in india

784
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,720
were on hotmail tens of millions of

785
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
people it was basically everyone had an

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
internet account in india had hotmail

787
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,279
within a very short time that was the

788
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
network effect in action right uh and

789
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,200
and you know

790
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,919
it's kind of amazing it's great when the

791
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,720
people you love show up and the services

792
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
you use and make it better and you make

793
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,919
it better for them it's like it's like a

794
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,679
big pot of stone soup where we're all

795
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,120
contributing something we're all getting

796
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
something back out of it so tech has

797
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
network effects in a way that like

798
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,799
cheerleading uniforms don't

799
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
but tech also has

800
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
intrinsically low

801
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,919
shipping cost switching costs it has low

802
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
switching costs because of touring

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
completeness because of von neumann

804
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,679
machines because

805
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,159
the only computer we know how to make is

806
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,799
the computer that can run every program

807
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,960
we know how to write

808
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,039
and that means that every walled garden

809
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,640
is built on sand that given enough time

810
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
technologists can figure out how to

811
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,960
tunnel through the walled garden how to

812
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
build something that plugs into it how

813
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
to make a word processing program that

814
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,000
can read the old word processors files

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,919
how to build a network protocol that can

816
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,320
plug into the existing network protocol

817
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,399
and you know tech companies they get

818
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
this they understand that raising

819
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,000
switching costs is their best way of of

820
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,559
uh growing um the ftc is suing facebook

821
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,039
thank goodness and they just released a

822
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
big torrent of documents about seven

823
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,320
eight months ago um they'd released

824
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
these documents before last summer but

825
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,520
then they re-released them without the

826
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
redactions and it has all these internal

827
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
emails between mark zuckerberg and his

828
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,679
lieutenants

829
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,360
and one of them is the product manager

830
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
designing google photos who sends this

831
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,000
email saying we are going to design or

832
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
not google photos a big part in facebook

833
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
photos of course he says we're going to

834
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,760
design facebook photos to make it a

835
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,399
really good product but not

836
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
because he thinks people want a good

837
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,440
product he says if we can lure people

838
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
into putting their family photos on

839
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,880
facebook but not give them any way to

840
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
export them we will make the switching

841
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,679
costs so high that they'll stay on

842
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
facebook even if say google plus is a

843
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
better service

844
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,039
so the tech companies really understand

845
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,760
that making switching costs high is the

846
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
way that you you shift value

847
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,559
from users to shareholders

848
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,399
now there are lots of people who say all

849
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,320
right then what we need to do is just

850
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
make these companies behave we need to

851
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,640
create some rules about how their

852
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,799
products can work and yeah all right i

853
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,480
get that and there's places where that

854
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
can work but honestly the answer to the

855
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,320
machine is almost never at the machine

856
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,159
and you know every attempt we've made to

857
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,559
make big tech behave just handed it more

858
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
power like when you deputize tech

859
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,760
companies to solve the problems of tech

860
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,919
companies then you make it prohibitively

861
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,159
expensive to compete with tech companies

862
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,320
if you say for example uh in order to

863
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,399
fight the harassment that your platform

864
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
enables you have to hire a million

865
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,039
moderators then what you say is that if

866
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,279
you want to make a new platform one that

867
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,200
is maybe more selective about who can

868
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
use it or that has different moderation

869
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,519
guidelines or that lets communities

870
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
moderate yourself you have to come up

871
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,440
with enough money to hire a million

872
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,679
moderators you know facebook couldn't

873
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,279
have started if that was the rule when

874
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
it started twitter couldn't have started

875
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
that was the rule when it started so all

876
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,320
you do is you hand them perpetual

877
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,519
dominance

878
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,480
and

879
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
you give the tech giants a great excuse

880
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
to block interoperability because if you

881
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
say look you're on the hook for

882
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,039
fraud on your platform harassment on

883
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,399
your platform hate speech on your

884
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,640
platform any other kind of the host of

885
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
evils which are you know don't get me

886
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
wrong actual evils

887
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
then what they'll say is

888
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
how are we going to fight

889
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
terrorist content on our platform if

890
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
third parties can connect to our

891
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,720
platform and exchange messages with our

892
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,600
users and we we can't block them

893
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,320
so

894
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
every one of these rules the terror

895
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,159
regulation and sdg in the european union

896
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,919
that are about stopping harmful content

897
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,919
and filtering them the european union's

898
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
copyright directive which is supposed to

899
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
impose copyright filters on all

900
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
user-generated content platforms

901
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,919
canada's lawful but awful proposals

902
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,600
where uh platforms are going to be

903
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
responsible for policing the speech of

904
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
their users and put taking down bad

905
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
speech within a very short time frame

906
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
all of these are destined to fail

907
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
because there really aren't enough human

908
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
moderators to to make those calls

909
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,679
they're also destined to fail because

910
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,200
we're not going to be able to solve this

911
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
with machine learning and so-called

912
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,320
artificial intelligence but what they

913
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
will do is reinforce the dominance of

914
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,559
these firms it's not going to weaken

915
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,440
them it's going to create a capital moat

916
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,519
around them where you can't enter the

917
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,919
industry unless you can afford to

918
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,320
undertake these kind of cosmetic but

919
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,760
very expensive measures that are

920
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,919
supposed to weaken tech but in fact

921
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,279
strengthen it

922
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,200
so what does weaken big tech

923
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
interoperability

924
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,039
interoperability that feature that is

925
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,960
intrinsic to computers because they are

926
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
universal machines so here's an example

927
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,399
of how big tech got weakened a historic

928
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,399
example i think a lot of us probably

929
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,240
remember not not just people are as old

930
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
as me

931
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
if you remember in the early 2000s there

932
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,280
was a moment when it really looked like

933
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,199
apple was about to go extinct the mac

934
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,918
was going to be a dead platform i was a

935
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
cio back then i

936
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
basically ran the technology for a lot

937
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,119
of small and medium-sized companies

938
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,679
and you know they would have lands

939
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,280
and on the land would be a mix of

940
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,599
windows and mac machines mostly windows

941
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,359
machines usually we'd have a mac for the

942
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,000
designer maybe the cio could say well i

943
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,599
like using my mac and i'm going to keep

944
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,440
it but for the most part you know the

945
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,800
accountants are the engineers the other

946
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,159
people in the firm

947
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,918
they would end up using windows machines

948
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,760
that was the way that it worked it was

949
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,879
what they were familiar with and it's

950
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,199
what they liked and there was a real

951
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,359
problem with um

952
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,760
windows machines and a mac network or

953
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,359
rather macs and windows machines sharing

954
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,719
the same network in the same work

955
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,680
environment and it was microsoft office

956
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
microsoft office did exist for the mac

957
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
in the early 2000s but it was like the

958
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,599
most cursed piece of software microsoft

959
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,160
ever released if you were a mac user and

960
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
a windows colleague sent you a word file

961
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,160
or an excel file or a powerpoint file

962
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,839
chances were you couldn't open it but if

963
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,599
you could and you saved it again they

964
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,880
wouldn't be able to open it in fact

965
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
maybe you couldn't open it again like

966
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,280
that file would be forever uh cursed and

967
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
and off limits uh abandoned hope all ye

968
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,720
who who hit the floppy disk icon

969
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,960
and you know it got to the point where

970
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
we just said like

971
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,079
we're gonna have to buy the designers a

972
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,920
windows machine just some low-powered

973
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,839
system we're gonna stick on their desk

974
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,599
next to their mac so the mac will be

975
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
what they do their work with but the

976
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,920
windows machine will be how they

977
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
exchange documents with their colleagues

978
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and that got very unwieldy and it and

979
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
became hard to administer and so

980
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
we just started beefing up the graphics

981
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
cards in those windows machines and

982
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,880
buying like adobe for windows and

983
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,560
throwing away the macs

984
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
now apple knew this was happening this

985
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,160
was an existential crisis for apple and

986
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,400
so steve jobs had an idea

987
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
he took some of his technologists and he

988
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
said go reverse engineer microsoft

989
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,079
office figure out how their file formats

990
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,480
work and make me a new product a product

991
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,720
called the iworks suite which numbers

992
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,240
pages keynote read and write word excel

993
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
and powerpoint files perfectly they just

994
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
they just tasked a team of engineers

995
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,560
every time microsoft shift shift uh an

996
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
update apple would go and reverse

997
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
engineer the new file formats and

998
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,200
maintain file format compatibility

999
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
and

1000
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,040
that's what saved them because now you

1001
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,880
just didn't have to be

1002
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
on windows to communicate with people

1003
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
who were using windows

1004
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,480
and right after the iwork suite came out

1005
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,119
apple conceived of quite an amazing ad

1006
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,240
campaign the switch campaign which just

1007
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
advertised that switching costs were now

1008
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,320
really low that the cost of switching to

1009
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
a mac was just like buying a mac it

1010
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
wasn't giving up all your files you just

1011
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,599
you know put your files on a zip

1012
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,839
cartridge or whatever and plugged it

1013
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,839
into your mac and your files would just

1014
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,320
work they just work thanks to the iworks

1015
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,200
suite

1016
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,000
so

1017
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,359
that is um how apple got saved that was

1018
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,240
how apple which was then medium tech

1019
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
really pushed back against microsoft

1020
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,160
which was big tech

1021
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,400
and you know regulators they have some

1022
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
understanding that interoperability is

1023
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
special and that interoperability is a

1024
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,119
remedy available in technology that is

1025
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,520
not available in other domains and so we

1026
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,160
are seeing some interoperability

1027
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,640
mandates showing up in lots of different

1028
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,480
contexts so the chinese cyberspace

1029
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,560
regulation has some interoperability

1030
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,400
mandates in the european union there's

1031
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
the digital markets act in the u.s

1032
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,800
there's the access act and in the uk the

1033
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
competition and markets authority which

1034
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,480
is their antitrust regulator has

1035
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
recommended uh interoperability mandates

1036
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,200
for different kinds of technologies and

1037
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,800
and these mandates they're kind of a

1038
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,640
mixed bag like in europe the digital

1039
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,800
markets act they decided that the first

1040
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
interoperability mandate would be on

1041
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,640
end-to-end encrypted messaging services

1042
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
which you know don't get me wrong they

1043
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
should be interoperable the idea that

1044
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,240
you have to stay on whatsapp or convince

1045
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
everyone you like to leave whatsapp

1046
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,040
sucks because you know they spy on you

1047
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,880
when you use whatsapp i would like

1048
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,200
people to be able to leave whatsapp

1049
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
as easily as possible without getting

1050
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
spied on by mark zuckerberg and his

1051
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
creepy cohort and um you know

1052
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
interoperability is what's going to do

1053
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
that the problem is that you know the

1054
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,079
stakes in end to end encrypted messaging

1055
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,359
are really high

1056
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,960
uh and it's easy to screw it up and the

1057
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,280
european union wants action on this like

1058
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,160
yesterday and if they rush this they're

1059
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,800
gonna blow up the security model right

1060
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,320
it's not an area where you can afford to

1061
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
make a mistake because you know as we

1062
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
see with the nso group and their pegasus

1063
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,680
malware

1064
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
the most repressive awful governments in

1065
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,880
the world go to enormous lengths to

1066
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,320
break end-to-end encrypted messaging

1067
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
services so they can figure out figure

1068
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,839
out who to round up and torture and

1069
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,640
murder uh you know jamal khashoggi was

1070
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,280
was lured to his death after the nso

1071
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,520
group's pegasus software was wielded by

1072
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
the saudi authorities to break into uh

1073
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,880
the whatsapp accounts of his his social

1074
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,119
media contacts and and figure out his

1075
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,359
movements and and trick him and so you

1076
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,640
know we really

1077
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
as much as it's important to get

1078
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,720
end-to-end encrypted messaging going

1079
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
making it the first

1080
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
one is kind of a mistake

1081
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,920
and i i

1082
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,599
lament that the european union has

1083
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,440
decided to start there but nevertheless

1084
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
it's a good idea

1085
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,320
and i think you know the best case

1086
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,079
scenario right now is that maybe they

1087
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,000
change what they start with the second

1088
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
best uh case scenario is that they

1089
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,079
extend the timeline so that we've got

1090
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,280
time to do it right and really

1091
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,079
standardize an interoperable protocol uh

1092
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,560
and and test it and make sure that

1093
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,640
the implementations are robust so that

1094
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,800
we don't expose billions of ede

1095
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,560
messenger users to risk but nevertheless

1096
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,640
it's pretty exciting that regulators in

1097
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,040
europe in the uk

1098
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,079
in australia in canada

1099
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,079
in the u.s and even in china are all

1100
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,839
thinking about interoperability as a

1101
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
specific remedy to weaken big tech

1102
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
platforms i i like that um but um

1103
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,079
administering these interop mandates is

1104
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,319
going to be really hard you know if you

1105
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,480
say to facebook hey you got to stand up

1106
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,119
and expose an api that will allow like

1107
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,119
mastodon and diaspora instances to

1108
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,520
exchange messages with facebook users

1109
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
then um

1110
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,319
you're going to have this problem that

1111
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,480
periodically facebook is going to say

1112
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
we took down the api

1113
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,560
because someone was doing something bad

1114
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,640
right our our intrusion detection system

1115
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
tripped we thought someone was

1116
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,680
exfiltrating user data uh and so out of

1117
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,200
an abundance of caution we shut it down

1118
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,640
to do some forensics and figure out if

1119
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,800
this was right and like we want them to

1120
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,520
do that we absolutely want companies

1121
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,240
that are guardians of user data to have

1122
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,880
good trip wires on their interfaces to

1123
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
make sure that those interfaces aren't

1124
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
being abused to invade their users

1125
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
privacy

1126
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,040
but also

1127
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
facebook just wants to with

1128
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
companies that are interoperating with

1129
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,440
it if you force facebook to open up

1130
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
interoperability in order to weaken it

1131
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,760
it's going to do everything it can

1132
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,400
to ruin the businesses of the companies

1133
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
that interoperate with it

1134
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,319
and you know facebook cheats all the

1135
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,000
time it would be pretty naive to think

1136
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,760
that they weren't cheating here

1137
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,839
and distinguishing the instance in which

1138
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
facebook shuts down its api

1139
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,880
on the pretext of blocking at data

1140
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,200
exfiltration and the instance in which

1141
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
facebook shuts down its api because

1142
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,480
there was real

1143
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,960
uh uh data exfiltration or it looked

1144
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,800
like there was real data exfiltration

1145
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,640
that is a really hard problem because

1146
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
facebook runs this like bespoke network

1147
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,720
infrastructure and to a first

1148
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
approximation everybody who understands

1149
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
how that network infrastructure works is

1150
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,560
a facebook employee and so who do you

1151
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
ask when facebook says that we shut this

1152
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,079
down

1153
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,319
who do you ask to go and have a look and

1154
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,560
and decide whether or not facebook was

1155
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,640
lying to you or whether something really

1156
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,040
bad was happening it is a long fact

1157
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,119
intensive process and it will create

1158
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,760
long intensive delays

1159
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,680
in figuring out whether facebook's

1160
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,359
outages are pretextual or legitimate

1161
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,800
and those delays will have real

1162
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,560
consequences for establishing

1163
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
competition you know if you're the

1164
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
founder of a startup that

1165
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
has lured users to your platform with

1166
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,160
the promise of being able to leave

1167
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,720
facebook have more privacy be in charge

1168
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,240
of your own moderation decisions but

1169
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,880
still be in communities on facebook by

1170
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
interoperating with them still

1171
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,920
communicate with users on facebook and

1172
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,520
like every other day

1173
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,359
your service goes down and you don't

1174
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,920
even know when it's going to go back up

1175
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
you're going to lose users and if you're

1176
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,720
an investor who invested in that startup

1177
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,000
you're going to lose confidence in that

1178
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
kind of startup and you know if you're

1179
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,040
the user

1180
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
you're going to go back to facebook

1181
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,920
and so we need to do something about

1182
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,520
this and we don't have to throw up our

1183
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,680
hands and say well tech mandates can't

1184
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,280
be administered so we shouldn't bother

1185
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,720
it far from it i think we can devise a

1186
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
mechanism that will make big companies

1187
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
want to cooperate rather than defect

1188
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,359
want to do the right thing and that

1189
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,680
mechanism is something called

1190
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,319
adversarial interoperability

1191
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,319
at electronic frontier foundation

1192
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,079
we called it this for a long time but

1193
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,560
it's very hard to pronounce and the

1194
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
acronym for adversarial interoperability

1195
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,040
is ai which is kind of confusing so we

1196
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
kind of brainstormed internally about

1197
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,240
another name for this we came up with

1198
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,560
competitive compatibility which we

1199
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,920
really like because it shortens to

1200
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,040
com-com

1201
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,720
which is fun to say so i'm going to call

1202
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,960
this comcom when you hear comcom think

1203
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,359
adversarial interoperability so what's

1204
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,079
comcom comcom is a catch-all term for

1205
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
the guerrilla tactics that kept the tech

1206
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,160
industry dynamic and pluralistic for

1207
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
decades the stuff that every issue of

1208
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
2600 magazine is filled with in tiny

1209
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,839
impossible to read type if you have old

1210
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,839
eyes like me and luxotica essilor has

1211
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,880
stolen your eyes i i say this having

1212
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,960
spent the last two weeks on a beach

1213
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,560
reading a year and a half's worth of

1214
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
issues cover to cover um

1215
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,200
those those tactics reverse engineering

1216
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,800
scraping bots

1217
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,599
the hacker tactics those are how we save

1218
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,720
the internet

1219
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,160
those are how the internet was saved

1220
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,960
over and over again comcom that created

1221
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,040
ibm pc clones it was comcom that let

1222
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,720
windows users take their microsoft

1223
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
office documents with them to the mac it

1224
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,880
was com com that like google indexed the

1225
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,359
web it was com com that let facebook

1226
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,720
enclose the web

1227
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,760
and comcom is built on that foundation

1228
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,640
of computer science the universality the

1229
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,040
bedrock principle that we know only how

1230
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
to make one kind of computer the turing

1231
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,720
complete von neumann machine that can

1232
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
run every program we know how to write

1233
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
and that means that inter-operators

1234
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,040
always have the advantage

1235
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,520
to block reverse engineering you have to

1236
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,960
build a technology and make no mistakes

1237
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,800
to successfully reverse engineer that

1238
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
technology you only need to find and

1239
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
exploit one mistake one error made by

1240
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,359
the incumbent firm

1241
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,760
comcom and mandates are like two-part

1242
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,560
epoxy the mandate is strong but it's

1243
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,440
rigid the adversarial interrupt the com

1244
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
com it's flexible but it's chaotic right

1245
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,000
if you're using bots to maintain

1246
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,920
interoperability to scrape a community

1247
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,359
on facebook and export it to diaspora

1248
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,040
it's gonna it's gonna break all the time

1249
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,119
right they're gonna change their html

1250
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,319
dom model and you're gonna have to

1251
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,240
rewrite your bot and whatever so it's

1252
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,720
it's chaotic but it's flexible and it

1253
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,880
can handle what you can throw at it

1254
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,240
together

1255
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,319
both uh com common mandates they're

1256
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,480
stronger and and more robust than either

1257
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,079
of them are on their own so let me give

1258
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,960
you a real world example back in 2012

1259
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,119
the voters in massachusetts passed an

1260
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,040
interoperability mandate via a ballot

1261
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,160
initiative with an 80 percent majority

1262
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,319
the mandate was an automotive right to

1263
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,880
repair rule and it required automakers

1264
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
to allow independent mechanics to access

1265
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,560
diagnostic information that was

1266
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,400
traversing the wired network within the

1267
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
car it's called the can bus you've

1268
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,440
probably heard of it

1269
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
now the automakers had an obvious

1270
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,599
counter move they switched to relaying

1271
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,000
diagnostic information over wireless

1272
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,240
networks not the can bus wireless

1273
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,839
networks were exempted from the mandate

1274
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,839
and this was back in 2012 before the

1275
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,839
supply chain shocks of the pandemic when

1276
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,200
chips were really cheap and they could

1277
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,599
buy like a system on a chip for 26 cents

1278
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,599
with a little wi-fi

1279
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,599
emitter in it and so they could build a

1280
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,079
little y-land inside every one of our

1281
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,000
cars and pass the error codes around

1282
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,640
there and and that way the mechanics

1283
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,880
couldn't access that data

1284
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,200
in 2020 eight years later voters

1285
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,640
returned to the ballot box and they

1286
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,960
passed another nearly identical

1287
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,280
automotive repair mandate this one

1288
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
patched that hole it said that

1289
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,640
independent mechanics needed to be

1290
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,400
furnished with access to wireless error

1291
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,640
codes too the the point of the mandate

1292
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,280
was the error code not the um underlying

1293
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,560
substrate of the network that it

1294
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,640
transmitted on and that mandate also

1295
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,920
passed with an overwhelming majority

1296
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,119
again about 80

1297
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
but the automakers have since gone to

1298
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,160
court and it's two years later and that

1299
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,560
mandate is still not in effect

1300
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,200
that means that it's been a decade since

1301
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
the automaker's monopolistic capture of

1302
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,520
the repair market was banned by law but

1303
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,680
they still get to run that racket

1304
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,520
now that is a decade in which mechanics

1305
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
closed their shop and exited the

1306
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
industry or they went to work for big

1307
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,520
car where drivers learned that if you go

1308
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,440
to an independent mechanic it's a roll

1309
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,040
of the dice that they may put it up on

1310
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,800
the lift take a look at it suck their

1311
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,720
teeth and say sorry only the

1312
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,280
manufacturer can fix this one because i

1313
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,520
can't get at the diagnostic codes this

1314
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
was a decade where investors learned

1315
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,839
that big car has a kill zone around its

1316
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,160
products and only fools would risk

1317
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,920
entering it

1318
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,000
but imagine if the mandate had been

1319
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,599
bolstered by comcom imagine if say three

1320
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,839
bright mit kids could have used their

1321
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,000
inter-operator's advantage to reverse

1322
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,599
engineer the error codes in those new

1323
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,359
cars they could have designed a gadget

1324
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,200
with a three dollar bill of materials

1325
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,559
ordered a container load of them from

1326
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,319
guangzhou had them shipped to the port

1327
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,760
of los angeles and sold them to

1328
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,079
mechanics across the state and because

1329
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,680
those markets are super leaky they could

1330
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
have sold them to mechanics across the

1331
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,680
country and across the world at a cost

1332
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,520
of 50 or 100

1333
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,800
imagine if they could have found

1334
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,640
investors to help them build ancillary

1335
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,480
services on top of that warranty

1336
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,040
services conduits for third-party parts

1337
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,720
all kinds of stuff that's super high

1338
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,440
margin that the automakers love

1339
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,800
well that would have been a different

1340
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,760
story

1341
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,119
you'd think that in a situation like

1342
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,400
that the automakers would have been

1343
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
incentivized to do the right thing to

1344
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,119
not create the space in which these

1345
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,280
three dollar gadgets flood the market

1346
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,200
and eat their lunch

1347
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,760
after all the one thing that a publicly

1348
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,599
listed company hates more than complying

1349
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,559
with regulations is facing

1350
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:35,680
unquantifiable risks

1351
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,400
the public markets they are notoriously

1352
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
vengeful when they are surprised with

1353
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,960
bad news like think back to last january

1354
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,359
when facebook revealed its uh first

1355
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,119
quarter uh number or last quarter

1356
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,119
numbers uh for for 2021 and showed that

1357
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,760
um their users had declined slightly

1358
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,839
more than they had anticipated and

1359
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
suffered the single largest one-day loss

1360
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,280
of any company in the history of the

1361
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,400
world losing 280 billion dollars off

1362
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,680
their market cap in one day about 25

1363
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
of the company's value

1364
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,400
so

1365
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,480
you'd hope that when confronted with

1366
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
either the chaos of comcom techno

1367
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,720
guerrilla warfare or the predictable

1368
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,880
world of just like doing what the law

1369
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,319
says they have to do

1370
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,400
they would comply with the law

1371
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,559
but of course no one ever lost money

1372
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,839
betting on the hubris of corporate

1373
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,800
monopolies so maybe they would cheat and

1374
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,119
if they did well the mit kids could have

1375
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,480
come to the rescue

1376
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,440
calm common mandates are complementary

1377
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,119
their strength and flexibility they're

1378
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,880
the carrot and the stick

1379
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,839
and the risks to public firms

1380
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,480
from uh the surprising bad news of

1381
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,319
comcom the unquantifiable risk of

1382
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,680
compcom

1383
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,400
it falls disproportionately on senior

1384
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,319
managers who are the ones who make the

1385
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,400
decisions about whether to cheat or not

1386
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,960
to cheat i mean think about it if your

1387
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,200
top management at facebook

1388
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,119
the major part of your compensation

1389
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,280
comes from stock which means that when

1390
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,680
the stock of facebook falls it wipes out

1391
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,760
your personal net worth

1392
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
so wouldn't you rather comply with the

1393
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
law than risk the surprising bad news

1394
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,680
that you have to confront your investors

1395
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,480
with

1396
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,400
not to mention that if you want to get

1397
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
involved in guerrilla warfare against

1398
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,119
comcom against inter-operators you need

1399
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,359
to hire some engineers and if your stock

1400
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,880
price keeps falling off a cliff you're

1401
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,400
going to have to pay them cash you're

1402
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,520
not going to be able to pay them in

1403
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
stock which is one of the ways that

1404
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,200
monopolies get huge advantages over

1405
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,520
their rivals they can pay their

1406
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,319
employees in money they print themselves

1407
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,559
in stock instead of having to pay them

1408
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,119
with the cash their shareholders prefer

1409
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,800
now if they lose that advantage because

1410
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,640
their stock has become really volatile

1411
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,920
because they keep cheating and every

1412
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,839
time they cheat it tempts people into

1413
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,760
com-com well

1414
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,200
then they're going to find themselves

1415
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,359
getting weaker and weaker

1416
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,920
but comcom is hard and not for

1417
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
technological reasons

1418
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,680
large firms have promulgated new

1419
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,079
legislation and new regulations and new

1420
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,559
interpretations of existing rules that

1421
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,559
make comcom illegal even sometimes a

1422
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,160
felony so

1423
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,480
you know if you're a 2600 reader you

1424
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,000
probably know about section 1201 of the

1425
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,280
dmca

1426
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,920
in fact the 2600 case is the case that

1427
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,400
established that section 1201 was just

1428
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
as bad as we we feared it would be

1429
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,240
section 1201 is the law that says that

1430
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,000
it's a felony punishable by up to five

1431
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,400
year prison sentence to uh reveal

1432
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,599
defects in uh drm systems and access

1433
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,839
control systems uh

1434
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,040
and 2600 published the dcsx code and we

1435
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,200
at eff unsuccessfully went to court to

1436
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,960
defend them because it turns out that

1437
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,880
the dmca means exactly what it says it

1438
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,280
does i'll say that we are today

1439
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
representing two other clients uh

1440
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,880
matthew green from johns hopkins and

1441
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,440
bunny huang uh ex of mit who's the guy

1442
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
who hacked the xbox and

1443
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,800
is currently building the precursor or

1444
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,880
great little mobile platform

1445
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,119
in a constitutional bid to overturn

1446
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,319
section 1201 but section 1201 uh

1447
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,160
combined with its european equivalent

1448
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,839
article 6 of the european copyright

1449
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,160
directive is a very powerful tool for

1450
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,400
making comcom illegal so are the cyber

1451
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,920
security laws like the computer fraud

1452
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,440
and abuse act that's the law that was

1453
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,760
used to hound poor aaron swartz into his

1454
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,599
grave and while it was narrowed

1455
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,359
significantly by the supreme court last

1456
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,280
summer with the van buren case it is

1457
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,839
still quite a danger and then there's on

1458
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,839
top of that software patents and exotic

1459
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,119
contract theories like tortious

1460
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,760
interference they all come together to

1461
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,680
make it very legally fraud to do com com

1462
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,440
and reforming all these laws which again

1463
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,880
that's something we should absolutely do

1464
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,119
it is a big lift and a multi-year

1465
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,400
project and

1466
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,240
just like corporate breakups we don't

1467
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,319
have time to wait for that to play out

1468
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,880
before we fix tech luckily we don't have

1469
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,119
to wait for those laws to be reformed in

1470
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,440
order to make the world safe for comcom

1471
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,599
for example we could pass the access act

1472
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,400
and or the dma and just wait for the big

1473
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,079
companies to cheat

1474
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,920
because they cheat

1475
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,000
and when we catch them cheating

1476
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,240
and we drag them into court and they

1477
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,400
offer a settlement because that's what

1478
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,680
they would prefer they don't want to

1479
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,760
spend 15 years in court

1480
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
we could in as part of that settlement

1481
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,680
impose a special master on them this is

1482
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,599
one of the remedies that's available to

1483
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,000
antitrust prosecutors we could say to

1484
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,960
them

1485
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,200
you're going to have an adult supervisor

1486
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,520
a lawyer independent lawyer who is going

1487
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,400
to have a first look at any legal threat

1488
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,760
you send to any competitor that is doing

1489
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,520
interoperability

1490
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,920
to make sure that when you threaten to

1491
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,160
sue someone for hacking your systems

1492
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,359
that they're actually hacking your

1493
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,640
systems that they're doing something

1494
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,319
that's adverse to your user's interests

1495
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,680
and not say adding a repair facility to

1496
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,440
your your system or making it more

1497
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,920
usable or making it more accessible or

1498
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,839
making it more secure private or just

1499
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,160
giving users more autonomy if that's the

1500
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,240
case if it's a pretextual lawsuit to

1501
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,960
block competition your special master is

1502
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,240
going to just say sorry you can't do it

1503
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,359
and there are other means at our

1504
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,599
disposal too uh one that i really like

1505
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,000
the idea of is reforming our procurement

1506
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,920
rules it's amazing how powerful

1507
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,800
procurement could be after all uncle sam

1508
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,960
and state governments and local

1509
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,440
governments they spend a lot of money on

1510
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,520
technology and as a matter of good

1511
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,079
prudent administration no public body

1512
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,599
should ever procure any product

1513
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,040
whether it's a car

1514
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,720
or google classroom or

1515
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,680
mobile phones for its uh its employees

1516
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,240
without first it's extracting a binding

1517
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,640
promise from the vendor not to legally

1518
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,720
attack inter-operators

1519
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,760
this is a very old principle a bedrock

1520
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,079
that we have somehow forgotten you know

1521
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,599
abe lincoln

1522
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,200
told the armorers who supplied the

1523
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,760
rifles to the union army that they must

1524
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,760
use interoperable tooling and ammunition

1525
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,720
i mean like obviously like what kind of

1526
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,319
commander-in-chief

1527
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,760
would say

1528
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
yeah give us proprietary ammo and if you

1529
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,520
decide not to make it anymore we'll just

1530
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,400
like wait or buy different guns for the

1531
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,119
army the enemy will understand right

1532
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,160
well i'll tell you what kind of

1533
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,160
commander-in-chief would say that all of

1534
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,319
the current commanders in chief because

1535
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,559
today the entire us military budget

1536
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,319
which like again don't get me wrong we

1537
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:13,920
should be zeroing that out but the

1538
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,319
entire u.s military budget is filled

1539
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,400
with price gouging from firms that have

1540
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
blocked interoperability for example in

1541
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,480
aerospace you have these private equity

1542
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,559
roll-ups where these private equity

1543
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,720
weirdos go out and they identify

1544
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,640
single-source suppliers for parts that

1545
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
are in the aerospace supply chain so a

1546
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,079
little widget that's used in a plane or

1547
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,160
a bomber or drone and they go and they

1548
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,920
buy that company up it's the only

1549
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,680
supplier for that widget

1550
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,319
and then here's the the crazy part they

1551
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,839
lower the price of the widget they make

1552
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,160
it basically free for the primary

1553
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,400
military contractors like boeing or

1554
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,480
lockheed so boeing and lockheed they're

1555
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,319
like yeah we'll just design our new

1556
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,680
stuff around this because we don't even

1557
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,480
pay

1558
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,760
to source these parts in our manufacture

1559
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,440
but then once they transfer this to the

1560
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,839
air force the army of the navy

1561
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,839
and the they need to fix it and they

1562
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,760
order replacement parts the parts come

1563
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,480
at a ten thousand percent markup so you

1564
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,160
know again just as a matter of good

1565
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,119
prudent uh uh administration

1566
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,359
nobody should be buying anything uh with

1567
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,520
public money unless they also have a

1568
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,200
promise from the manufacturer that

1569
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,520
they're not going to go after the uh the

1570
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,000
firms and say to them uh or they're not

1571
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,280
going to go after inter operators and

1572
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,880
say to them that they're not allowed to

1573
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,559
to make replacement parts not allowed to

1574
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,040
make software not allowed to make uh

1575
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
plugins not allowed to take over the

1576
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,960
management of the tool and so on you

1577
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,319
know every time a government motor pool

1578
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,400
buys a car every time a school district

1579
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,720
licenses google classroom every time a

1580
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,520
ministry or a department licenses

1581
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,880
microsoft teams for its video

1582
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
conferencing they should be extracting

1583
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,720
binding non-aggression covenants from

1584
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,240
those suppliers

1585
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,079
these aren't the only means to restore

1586
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,760
the legal basis for the ancient and

1587
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,160
honorable tradition of comcom like we

1588
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,799
could enact a a an inter-operator's

1589
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,240
defense and law we could just say

1590
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,920
notwithstanding all these other laws if

1591
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,520
you can show that you are doing

1592
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,119
something bona fide and in the public

1593
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,240
interest that you have a defense in law

1594
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,400
irrespective of how we restore comcom we

1595
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,680
should do it

1596
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,720
we should

1597
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,799
restore the mechanism that stabilizes

1598
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:13,920
our interrupt

1599
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,200
interrupt mandates and makes them

1600
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,000
administratable because that is how

1601
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,319
we can fight for the users that is how

1602
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,160
we can put people in charge of their

1603
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,839
technology that is how we can let them

1604
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,160
pick the part of the tool that provides

1605
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,640
them with value and leave the part of

1606
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,359
the tool that sucks value out of them

1607
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,599
that is how we can unleash

1608
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,160
the hackers who've been reading 2600

1609
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,359
ever since the dcss case or even before

1610
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,280
we can unleash them to make the tools

1611
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,680
that help the users live a dignified

1612
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,720
technological existence and it is how we

1613
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,599
build the vanguard of the antitrust

1614
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,440
movement that will take back control

1615
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,520
from all kinds of corporations because

1616
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,599
once we tame big tech

1617
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,839
with antitrust we will have built an

1618
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,839
antitrust movement that can go after the

1619
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,839
people who make your glasses and that

1620
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,920
scumbag who ran the wrestling league and

1621
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,839
the people who own all the cheerleader

1622
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,079
uniform companies and the idiots who

1623
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,520
keep building bigger ships that get

1624
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,760
stuck in the suez canal we can break

1625
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,359
them all up we can usher in a new era

1626
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,760
so every time i talk to 2600 the last

1627
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,079
time i talk to 2600 i end my talk with

1628
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,520
with the same thing um and it's and it's

1629
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,880
a quote or a story about the the scholar

1630
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,520
james boyle jamie is a copyright scholar

1631
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,880
at uh university at duke university runs

1632
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,640
the center for the public domain with

1633
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,000
jennifer jenkins jamie um uh

1634
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,839
is a great uh he was part of the

1635
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,839
creative commons uh founding team and

1636
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,040
he's just a a great all-arounder and he

1637
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,480
tells the story

1638
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,440
about the coining of the term ecology

1639
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,040
and what it did

1640
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,760
to

1641
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,400
the people who had issues with the way

1642
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,359
that we

1643
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,960
treated our planet

1644
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,720
and he says that before the term ecology

1645
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,000
was coined

1646
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
it wasn't obvious

1647
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,559
that if i cared about owls and you cared

1648
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,559
about the ozone layer that we were

1649
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,960
fighting the same fight like on its face

1650
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280
what do charismatic nocturnal avians

1651
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
have to do the gaseous composition of

1652
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,480
the upper atmosphere

1653
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,640
but jamie says that the term ecology

1654
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,400
took a thousand movements

1655
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,240
a thousand issues and welded them

1656
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,720
together into one movement that it

1657
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,559
created a kind of coherence between

1658
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,400
these different struggles

1659
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
and today you know if you use technology

1660
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,640
you understand what monopolies have done

1661
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,720
to the wild and wooly internet that you

1662
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,200
know the the the transformation of the

1663
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,280
web into five giant websites filled with

1664
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,119
screenshots of text from the other four

1665
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,359
was not an accident it was a plan

1666
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,200
and it happened because regulators let

1667
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
it happen and we could take our internet

1668
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,640
back but you know if you're involved in

1669
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,079
i don't care what it is cheerleader

1670
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,680
uniforms or

1671
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,000
sustainable energy or professional

1672
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,319
wrestling or eyeglasses

1673
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,000
you also understand that something

1674
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,240
rotten is going on and as we make the

1675
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,640
connection between all of these between

1676
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,839
the fact that there's only four

1677
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,240
publishers left and one bookstore

1678
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,599
online and one national chain bookstore

1679
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,040
between the fact that there's only three

1680
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,520
record labels left and two major audio

1681
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,680
streaming platforms uh between the fact

1682
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,079
that there's uh five giant banks and

1683
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,440
that there's just a couple of giant

1684
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,960
hydrocarbon companies that run all the

1685
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,079
gas lines

1686
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,680
once we make those connections and we

1687
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,400
realize that all of these arose out of

1688
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,880
the same regulatory reform that robert

1689
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,599
bork secret history where we replaced

1690
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,440
the harmful dominance standard with the

1691
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,440
consumer welfare standard and then we

1692
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,960
said the consumer welfare standard is a

1693
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,720
needle that's impossible to thread and

1694
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,079
all monopolies should be treated as

1695
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,599
presumptively good once we understand

1696
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,160
that we will raise an army

1697
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,079
that will fight and just like the people

1698
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,359
who cared about owls fought for the

1699
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:48,559
ozone layer the people who cared about

1700
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,319
the ozone layer fought for the owls the

1701
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,520
people are worried about cheerleader

1702
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,200
uniforms will be there to bust facebook

1703
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,480
and the people who want to bust facebook

1704
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,960
will be there to bust the the eyeglasses

1705
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,200
monopoly 2. that is how we're going to

1706
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,960
win and it's going to start with this

1707
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,599
because tech is not exceptional except

1708
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,200
to the extent that it is exceptional the

1709
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,119
thing that is exceptional about tech is

1710
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,480
it's the battlefield that we're going to

1711
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,160
fight all these other battles on it's

1712
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,680
how we're going to find each other it's

1713
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,359
how we're going to coordinate our work

1714
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,440
and it's how we're going to win

1715
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,839
so that's my talk i really appreciate

1716
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,680
you listening this is the part where i

1717
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,440
tab back to my zoom window and make sure

1718
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,200
that i haven't been uh disconnected for

1719
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,680
the last hour looks like i'm still good

1720
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,040
that's good i would have been

1721
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,119
embarrassing and now i take your

1722
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,760
questions so i hope you have some good

1723
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,760
ones

1724
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,420
[Applause]

1725
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,079
all right cory well you have not been uh

1726
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,280
tapped out on your zoom window for the

1727
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,359
last hour everyone has been paying

1728
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,839
rapidly listening to your talk so with

1729
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,000
that we'll start doing a q a i don't

1730
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,680
know if anyone has any questions we have

1731
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,200
a number of questions the matrix chat so

1732
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,720
i'll try to alternate back and forth if

1733
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,759
we have some live audience members

1734
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,400
hi corey hi it's holmes hi hey

1735
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,520
um

1736
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,599
i'm wondering how so when i think about

1737
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,400
how comcom plays out in um

1738
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,520
in

1739
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,119
mobile apps

1740
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,480
which is where a lot of the action is

1741
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,839
now with software

1742
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,880
um

1743
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,160
you have

1744
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,119
the ios app store and then you have

1745
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,200
underneath that you know they have

1746
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,480
control over what apps people can

1747
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,839
install and so

1748
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,359
you know say someone made a comcom

1749
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,880
instagram that didn't have ads in it

1750
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,000
which is the main

1751
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,359
that's the main way instagram puts the

1752
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,640
screws to people is it makes them watch

1753
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,319
a ton of ads in order to see pictures of

1754
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,160
whatever they're interested in

1755
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,559
can't i mean unless you unravel the app

1756
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,440
store with com com the app facebook will

1757
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,799
just ask the app store to block the

1758
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,280
thing and then if unraveling the app

1759
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,599
store sounds like a harder problem like

1760
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,039
pretty akin to the one you're talking

1761
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,319
about of the

1762
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,680
the situation where someone just

1763
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,200
disrupts you

1764
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,079
you know

1765
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,760
if you made an alternate app store by

1766
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,920
hacking the iphone every single software

1767
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,520
update something would fail

1768
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,960
and

1769
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,319
you know it throws things back in the

1770
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,000
territory of like okay we need some

1771
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,520
legal intervention

1772
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,880
so i'm just thinking about how that

1773
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,559
plays out with apps and

1774
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,440
do you

1775
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,720
how do you think that plays out do you

1776
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,000
see something more optimistic there or

1777
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,960
is it

1778
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,640
is it pretty much that we won't win that

1779
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,880
much until we have

1780
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,599
the big fight about competition policy

1781
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,359
and when

1782
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,200
i i think that you're right that app

1783
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,920
stores are a real locus of control

1784
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
but it's also it also means that there's

1785
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,319
a real um constituency of people who

1786
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,880
want to see them reformed so i we just

1787
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,079
at eff submitted comments that i drafted

1788
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,079
on the competition markets authority in

1789
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,119
the uk

1790
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,559
uh inquiry

1791
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,480
on whether they should force apple to

1792
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,160
support browser engines other than

1793
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,559
webkit specifically browser engines that

1794
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,559
would allow for web apps to be deployed

1795
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,839
because that's all that's how you get

1796
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,920
around it right is is if you have full

1797
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,520
html5 uh web web app support

1798
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,200
you can just basically encounter in fact

1799
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,599
you know most apps most apps are just

1800
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,839
html5 web apps that have been you know

1801
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,400
wrapped up with some ios governs

1802
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,760
and

1803
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,359
and and you're right that you need you

1804
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,119
probably need a mandate but again i

1805
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,079
think that

1806
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,240
if we said

1807
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,599
to apple

1808
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,039
not only are we going to force you to

1809
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,039
support non-webkit

1810
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,559
browser engines

1811
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,319
on ios

1812
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,880
but we are also going to immunize people

1813
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,280
who do things like exploit checkmate

1814
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
which is the defect in the

1815
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
secure computing

1816
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,480
environment for ios that affects eight

1817
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,799
generations of ios devices spanning

1818
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,079
eight years

1819
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,440
we're going to immunize them from

1820
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,599
liability under anti-circumvention and

1821
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,119
contract and

1822
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,880
you know software patent or whatever if

1823
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,839
they use that to uh

1824
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,079
add another browser engine

1825
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,960
to ios or add you know browser engines

1826
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,440
or or extend the webkit browser engine

1827
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,839
support so that it can be uh

1828
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,240
can can be a substrate for full-fledged

1829
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,280
web apps um then apple will have a

1830
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,880
strong incentive

1831
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,079
to

1832
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,799
you know support webkit uh or you know

1833
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,880
webkit alternatives that that support

1834
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,480
real web apps

1835
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,280
not because comcom will be like a stable

1836
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,319
remedy if it cheats but because um

1837
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,960
apple will hurt as badly in a world in

1838
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,280
which comcom is legal as the people who

1839
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,960
have to throw engineering at making

1840
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,359
comcom work that it will just be a just

1841
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,160
be a nightmare for apple to not be able

1842
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,440
to go to court and stop people from uh

1843
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,640
exploiting checkmate to to add uh

1844
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,799
browser engines it's just like their

1845
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,640
worst case scenario

1846
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,319
it makes them hire a bunch of engineers

1847
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,599
it makes them divert engineers from

1848
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,440
products that are existing it makes them

1849
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,319
you know

1850
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,079
do all kinds of stuff they just really

1851
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,119
don't want to do and so as between

1852
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,520
the marginal losses from having to

1853
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,280
operate a web store

1854
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,359
where or an app store that people use

1855
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,640
because it's better than the other app

1856
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,079
stores and not because it's illegal to

1857
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,960
make another app store and uh

1858
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,319
and and um you know having to uh

1859
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,839
only fight

1860
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,599
with guerrilla warfare and never with

1861
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,760
lawyers right you can think about like

1862
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,119
these tech companies as having a

1863
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,480
building full of lawyers in a building

1864
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,400
full of engineers and whenever anyone

1865
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,839
starts to interoperate with them they

1866
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,280
don't even stop at the building full of

1867
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,319
engineers they go straight to the

1868
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,839
building full of lawyers because they

1869
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,359
understand that the lawyer drags you

1870
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,000
into court and like destroys you

1871
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,760
that you know no one's going to invest

1872
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,280
in another company that wants to do what

1873
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,039
you're going to do and anyone who's like

1874
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,640
thinking of doing it will have a hard

1875
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,640
time recruiting participants and you

1876
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,520
know if they're doing it under

1877
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,200
university the university won't approve

1878
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,119
it and so on so they really want to just

1879
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,039
like win the fight once with a lawyer if

1880
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,319
we take away their right to win the

1881
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,160
fight with a lawyer we force them to

1882
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
fight with engineers they might decide

1883
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,839
not to fight at all and if they do

1884
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,359
decide to fight well then we'll at least

1885
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,599
be able to like patch in a remedy won't

1886
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,880
be as good as a stable mandate but you

1887
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,400
know one of the things that i didn't

1888
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,079
mention when i told the story of iwork

1889
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,880
suite and microsoft and um

1890
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,839
and

1891
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,839
pages and keynote numbers

1892
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,039
is uh

1893
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,480
microsoft

1894
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,880
after pages was a success after a couple

1895
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,039
of rounds of combat where microsoft

1896
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,720
changed the file format and pages was

1897
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,119
able to uh match those changes quickly

1898
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,799
so they could maintain compatibility

1899
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,119
microsoft took its word files its office

1900
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,039
files to a standards body and

1901
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,000
standardize them that's that x and xlsx

1902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,200
and docx and pptx that's the xml

1903
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,280
standard version of those documents and

1904
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,039
it's why we now have like google docs

1905
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,359
and libreoffice and all those other

1906
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,200
things that read and write uh office

1907
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
files it's why you can paste an office

1908
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,079
file

1909
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,559
into a browser window and have it

1910
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,640
maintain like formatting and links and

1911
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,799
data structures and so on because it's

1912
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,400
it's been standardized like there just

1913
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,640
came a point where breaking

1914
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,440
interoperability became a pure cost

1915
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,520
center with no profits

1916
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,359
and if we make it into a pure cost

1917
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,400
center with no profits then it just the

1918
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,400
the company will just stop trying to do

1919
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,799
it or or is is likely to stop trying to

1920
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,640
do it because they're not doing it just

1921
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,160
because they're ornery they're doing it

1922
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,520
because it makes them a ton of

1923
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,000
money and if we if we it doesn't have to

1924
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,759
be the case that anyone else makes money

1925
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,439
we just have to make it so they have

1926
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,359
such high cost that they no longer make

1927
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,479
money

1928
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,238
by blocking interrupt and then they'll

1929
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,880
change their minds

1930
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,120
thanks

1931
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,640
hi thank you this was really interesting

1932
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,960
and i'm a fan of your novels um i wanted

1933
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,158
to ask you talked a bit about um

1934
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,319
fighting abuses such as terrorism

1935
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,080
harassment these things that people do

1936
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,198
badly with

1937
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:46,960
um with every platform they can find to

1938
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,158
do it on

1939
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,759
and one of the arguments that

1940
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,359
you hear i think often even from people

1941
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,640
who work on things like content

1942
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,080
moderation within

1943
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,319
the big social media companies is that

1944
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,238
if you break up the company it makes

1945
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,960
content moderation harder and

1946
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,040
i think you alluded to earlier almost

1947
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,359
saying that it's like a losing battle

1948
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,279
even within the company which i doubt

1949
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,319
you would say that we should just give

1950
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,600
up on it completely so i guess i'm

1951
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,000
wondering what's your solution how do we

1952
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
have effective

1953
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,080
like non-abusive internet in a world

1954
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,839
where there's sort of more smaller

1955
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,279
players

1956
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,359
so i guess it depends on on what your

1957
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,359
non-abusive internet looks like right is

1958
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,198
your non-abusive internet and i don't

1959
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,960
mean to single like you i mean like is

1960
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,279
is the hypothetical non-abusive internet

1961
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,600
that we're trying to build is it uh an

1962
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,238
internet in which odious people never

1963
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,000
say disgusting things not even to each

1964
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,359
other or is it one in which you can be a

1965
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,520
full-fledged participant in the internet

1966
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,319
without having to be subjected to the

1967
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,040
disgusting views of odious people

1968
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,279
and i'm in favor of the second one i

1969
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,279
think the first one really is a fool's

1970
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,158
errand um you know i i

1971
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,239
deplore racism as much as the next

1972
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,080
person and i would love to live in a

1973
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,080
world free from racism

1974
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,239
i believe that people who operate public

1975
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,400
spaces should have the right to kick out

1976
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,600
others for

1977
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,040
uh

1978
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,440
making racist statements but i also

1979
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,960
think that it's probably a bridge too

1980
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,960
far to say that we're going to try and

1981
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,560
engineer a system in which no one is

1982
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,320
racist not even in the privacy of their

1983
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
own living room right or in the privacy

1984
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,800
of their own uh campfire discussion with

1985
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,960
their co-racists that that's probably

1986
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,040
like and to me that's what 4chan is

1987
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,719
right it's it's um

1988
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,960
it's probably too much to hope that

1989
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,120
there will never be a conversation space

1990
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,120
like that and if what we try to do if

1991
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,000
the argument so that you you there are

1992
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,440
there's more than one way that people

1993
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,040
involved in content moderation express

1994
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,360
this and you alluded to one

1995
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,960
the one of the things that people

1996
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,040
involved in in content moderation

1997
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,440
battles say or imply

1998
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,920
is if we keep all the conversation on

1999
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,679
facebook if we make it effectively

2000
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,199
impossible to have a conversational

2001
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,760
space that's not facebook all we need to

2002
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,080
do is make facebook good and then all

2003
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,480
the bad conversation disappears

2004
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,120
and i think that that is both um wrong

2005
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,199
and not good even if even if it were

2006
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,719
right it would be bad um i don't think

2007
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:09,440
that

2008
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,679
it is a net positive no matter how good

2009
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,280
facebook is at moderating our

2010
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,199
conversations i don't think it's a net

2011
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,880
positive to vest all authority over how

2012
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,080
we conduct discourse in one firm um

2013
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,000
and and you know i don't want to imply

2014
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,520
that you do i'm just trying to address

2015
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,360
one of the arguments from the

2016
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,000
centralized content moderation side

2017
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,199
i think that um there's a softer version

2018
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,320
of this

2019
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,800
which is well if most conversation

2020
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,520
happens on facebook then we accomplish

2021
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,520
much the same things we we chase the

2022
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,520
odious people with the hateful views to

2023
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,239
the periphery uh and the problem with

2024
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,440
that

2025
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,400
is that content moderation at scale

2026
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,679
has

2027
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,120
uh a lot of failure modes that

2028
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,800
disproportionately affect the people

2029
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,760
that we worry about when we worry about

2030
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,000
hateful conduct online harassment and so

2031
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,080
on online marginalized users that um

2032
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,400
making a three-ring binder thick enough

2033
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,560
to contain the policy

2034
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,360
that

2035
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,800
states what is and isn't

2036
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,120
conversationally acceptable among three

2037
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,960
billion facebook users in a hundred

2038
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,600
companies speaking a thousand languages

2039
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,560
is impossible and so that means that

2040
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,760
facebook is always going to make errors

2041
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,560
and that those errors will be made by

2042
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,400
a kind of civil bureaucratic apparatus

2043
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,920
which is what we can think of facebook

2044
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,159
moderation as and and for facebook think

2045
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,840
youtube or twitter or any of these other

2046
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,640
big firms that you know if you've ever

2047
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,640
been in in social media jail or had a

2048
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,000
post taken down or whatever and how to

2049
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,120
argue with them you understand that

2050
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,400
there's a kind of

2051
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,640
weird kangaroo court that they all run

2052
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,080
and and the reason that they're running

2053
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,520
a kangaroo court is if they ran an

2054
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,760
actual formal justice system

2055
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,560
for for this if every time they

2056
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,800
tagged or blocked or took down

2057
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,719
a piece of content

2058
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,320
you had the right to an attorney who

2059
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,400
could argue for that content

2060
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,120
uh you know they would they it would be

2061
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,880
full employment for internet lawyers

2062
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,120
right there'd just be like an infinitude

2063
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,360
of people whose job it would be to argue

2064
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,040
about their content moderation choices

2065
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,840
so it's this very impossible

2066
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,199
situation meanwhile the people who are

2067
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,120
like at the coalface the people who are

2068
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,960
having the discussion who are in the

2069
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
social space are capable of

2070
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,880
understanding the nuance

2071
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,800
and also understanding

2072
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,560
when exceptions should and shouldn't be

2073
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,440
made

2074
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,600
so you know the classic example would be

2075
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,920
survivors of terrorist violence who

2076
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,960
collect

2077
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,840
uh

2078
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,320
evidence of the terrorist violence for

2079
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,280
use

2080
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,360
in human rights tribunals

2081
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,239
and other important reckonings for the

2082
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,400
the perpetrators of the violence

2083
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,360
who

2084
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,920
are capable of understanding

2085
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,360
what elements of that video or audio or

2086
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,640
text

2087
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,640
or still imagery

2088
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,679
is important to bearing witness

2089
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,199
and that is a thing that an external

2090
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,400
moderator

2091
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,480
who is far removed from a context that

2092
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,159
thankfully most of us don't have to

2093
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,080
contend with

2094
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,480
will struggle to get right

2095
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,159
and those failures are very

2096
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,159
consequential

2097
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,320
likewise if you're in a marginalized

2098
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,600
community

2099
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,040
in which you discuss and commiserate

2100
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,080
and uh give strength to one another

2101
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,679
over the

2102
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,679
racist or xenophobic attacks that you've

2103
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,159
been subject to online and you repeat

2104
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,040
those slurs and you you

2105
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,159
talk about

2106
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,000
why they were hurtful

2107
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,880
and a moderator has to decide

2108
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,520
whether your use of a slur

2109
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,600
is impermissible

2110
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,080
they lack the context often to

2111
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,239
understand

2112
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,000
what the difference is between a group

2113
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,400
of people who are against whom slurs are

2114
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,600
directed

2115
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,280
using it is

2116
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,760
versus the people who use those slurs to

2117
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,920
harm those marginalized users

2118
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,080
and so i think the right answer

2119
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,320
is to give the communities themselves

2120
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,239
more control and so

2121
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,880
you know i uh like the model of the

2122
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,199
fetiverse uh and i think the idea that

2123
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,440
you can stand up a server that connects

2124
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,320
to other servers uh through whose users

2125
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,560
can exchange messages with one another

2126
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,800
um who uh

2127
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,400
can block

2128
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,040
other servers or users if they think

2129
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,120
that those servers policies are bad or

2130
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
the user is bad

2131
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,880
and where it's very easy to move from

2132
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,719
one server to another if the moderation

2133
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,800
policies don't suit you and in which you

2134
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,480
have conversations that become

2135
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,400
you know potentially fragmented either

2136
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,080
within a conversation so you might have

2137
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:42,960
say

2138
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,800
a group of um

2139
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,880
well we we actually represented at eff

2140
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,040
we represented a group of breast cancer

2141
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,040
previvors so these are

2142
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,360
women who carry a gene

2143
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,360
that makes it likely that they could

2144
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,440
develop breast cancer and whose female

2145
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,760
relatives have therefore often contended

2146
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,560
with or even died of breast cancer

2147
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,640
and and so that group might split right

2148
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,400
you might say there might be different

2149
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,239
views about what is and is an acceptable

2150
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,159
discourse within that group and rather

2151
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,080
than like facebook making the final

2152
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,080
judgment call about what that is the

2153
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,400
users themselves could decide to split

2154
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,800
or a user user or substantial portion of

2155
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,840
those users might migrate to a server

2156
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,640
where

2157
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,880
certain words phrases or conduct is

2158
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,800
blocked and so

2159
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,239
you know they would effectively be

2160
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,679
shadow banning other members of the

2161
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,840
group without the shadow right that the

2162
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,920
other members the group would know that

2163
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,440
somewhere out there there's a server

2164
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,280
where if they use certain phrases or

2165
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,679
certain words or whatever or if they act

2166
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,120
in certain ways their messages will

2167
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,640
disappear and maybe their account will

2168
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,320
be blocked from those users and that'll

2169
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,239
just be like something they have to

2170
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,440
contend with

2171
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,679
um and i i think that that is a wildly

2172
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,440
imperfect system whose virtue is that

2173
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,040
it's better than all the other systems

2174
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,440
that that the people who are in the

2175
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
community understand its norms in a way

2176
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,520
that that just can't be adequately

2177
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,920
captured and that what you lose from

2178
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,840
having the resources

2179
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,080
of a company with the size and the

2180
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,000
monopoly control of facebook that can

2181
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,120
extract huge margins right um facebook's

2182
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,280
cost of capital is like nine percent and

2183
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,679
its return on capital is like 50

2184
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,360
so basically every time they raise a

2185
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,600
dollar they stick it into operations and

2186
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,360
they get five dollars out it's just like

2187
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,440
a machine for printing money and you

2188
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,880
know the most of that money ends up in

2189
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,560
their shareholders pockets but some of

2190
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,480
it goes for you know

2191
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,800
giant boiler rooms full of traumatized

2192
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,760
filipino uh uh content moderators who

2193
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,360
watch beheading videos all day and are

2194
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,320
denied benefits and and you know the the

2195
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,480
argument that if you can just um

2196
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,840
if you if you have those windfall

2197
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
profits you can spend them on those

2198
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,000
boiler rooms and that that's that won't

2199
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,600
be available to community groups is true

2200
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
but on the other hand

2201
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,360
this this

2202
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,920
complexity the problem is not linear

2203
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,120
that

2204
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,560
trying to solve all the community's

2205
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,800
problems and trying to come up with a

2206
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,400
single standard for all the communities

2207
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,440
and all the spaces and all the

2208
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,000
contingencies and to understand them and

2209
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,239
to manage that well

2210
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,280
is

2211
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,880
a problem that gets harder as the groups

2212
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,080
get bigger

2213
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,120
and once the once the problem is very

2214
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,640
large once you're trying to come up with

2215
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,480
a coherent standard for billions of

2216
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,520
people

2217
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,320
um it becomes impossible and so i think

2218
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,800
it erases the advantage of lots of money

2219
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,400
and of course

2220
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,040
anyone who stays on facebook

2221
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,199
will be subject to facebook's moderation

2222
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:34,640
and so if you

2223
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,320
find yourself somewhere else on the

2224
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,560
internet having left facebook

2225
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,679
and uh not liking the fact that these

2226
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,760
this less resource but

2227
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,560
also less complicated content moderation

2228
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,159
team uh

2229
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,080
is not protecting you adequately and you

2230
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,760
you long for the

2231
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,760
tender embrace of facebook's moderation

2232
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,199
policies

2233
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,800
you know nothing stops you in fact this

2234
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,400
makes it really easy like

2235
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,880
one of the things that um

2236
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,239
the hegemony of facebook and the

2237
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,760
blocking of interoperability and you

2238
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,880
know for facebook read all the other

2239
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,880
social spaces as well one of the things

2240
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,480
that it does is it means that we can't

2241
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,239
even figure out whether we like might

2242
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:11,920
like something else better we end up

2243
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,600
having these conversations entirely in

2244
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,040
the hypothetical

2245
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,159
uh where we're not able to to really you

2246
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,640
know give people the autonomy

2247
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,800
and you know facebook

2248
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,719
doesn't make it very hard to leave

2249
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,960
facebook because they want to protect

2250
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,920
you

2251
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,600
they make it very hard to leave facebook

2252
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
because

2253
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,159
they understand that the harder it is to

2254
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,640
leave the less they have to protect you

2255
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,120
and the more you'll put up with before

2256
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,719
you leave and so

2257
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,400
i i do think that adding

2258
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,400
interoperability

2259
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,440
makes

2260
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,679
the content moderation

2261
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,840
both more possible because we can make

2262
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,000
it more local and for the large

2263
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,760
platforms it aligns their incentives

2264
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,000
with making content moderation better

2265
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,159
and the last thing i'll say about como

2266
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,840
is that um

2267
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,640
the uh um oh no i just blew my buffer

2268
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,920
what was i gonna say about content

2269
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,880
moderation oh yeah it's that there's a

2270
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,840
there's a failure mode of asking sort of

2271
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,920
content moderation cops

2272
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,639
to block harassment or other odious acts

2273
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,760
online which is that you have to define

2274
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,440
them right you have to have somewhere

2275
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,239
you have to tell your content moderators

2276
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,120
what constitutes bad acts online what

2277
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,960
what is beyond the pale and what they

2278
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,159
have to block

2279
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,000
and if if you are

2280
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,719
a

2281
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,760
kind of professional harasser

2282
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,159
you've got like every hour that god sent

2283
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,760
to figure out

2284
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,239
what is and is not harassment according

2285
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,560
to the three-ring binder or the you know

2286
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,480
the consensus the moderators the policy

2287
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,719
of facebook or the whatever platform

2288
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,880
you're on and

2289
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,560
you can devise a range of conduct that

2290
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,880
is almost but not quite harassment or

2291
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,280
almost but not quite a slur

2292
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,120
and for the person receiving that

2293
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,920
conduct it is indistinguishable from the

2294
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,000
from harassment or a slur

2295
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,719
but

2296
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,800
for the content moderators it's not

2297
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,480
right for the content moderators you as

2298
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,400
like an internet lawyer have figured out

2299
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,719
how to how to engage in conduct that

2300
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,159
they will permit

2301
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,400
and then even worse

2302
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,320
is that because you know where the line

2303
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,440
is

2304
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,360
you can goad your opponents into

2305
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,080
crossing the line so you may remember

2306
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,480
that there was this moment where um

2307
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,560
facebook uh

2308
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,040
said what was it kill all white men is

2309
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,120
not is not permissible

2310
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,440
but kill all black children was and

2311
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,040
there was something where it was like

2312
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,199
it's because their age was not a

2313
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,400
protected category but sex was some some

2314
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,480
crazy thing like this

2315
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,199
and if you can if you know

2316
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,960
this weird

2317
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,120
kind of uh loophole and facebook

2318
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,920
moderation policy you can exploit it to

2319
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,400
goad your enemy into crossing the line

2320
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,080
and then you can go to the moderator and

2321
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,440
you can say look

2322
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,000
this person is engaged in harassment

2323
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
suspend their account and this is in

2324
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,520
fact the thing we see all the time on

2325
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,960
twitter and facebook where you have

2326
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,280
professional trolls and so

2327
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,239
i think that like just structurally

2328
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,000
throwing more moderators at content

2329
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,760
moderation

2330
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,840
fails for like really important deep

2331
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,760
rules and and it starts to look like

2332
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,360
doing the same thing over and over again

2333
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,440
and expecting a different result and i

2334
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,639
think we need to try different

2335
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,520
structures for moderation

2336
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,920
rather than

2337
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,400
trying to like moderate harder trying to

2338
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,239
spend more money on moderation i hope

2339
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,159
that answers your question it's a really

2340
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,080
good question i i i really want to

2341
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,679
stress that because

2342
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,199
you know the life of people on the

2343
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,120
internet who are on the wrong end of

2344
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,800
harassment campaigns

2345
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,280
is miserable in a way that

2346
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,800
really beggars description and if you've

2347
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,880
never been subjected to it

2348
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,719
you know you can't really understand it

2349
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,040
and and it's not a consideration i take

2350
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,840
lightly we really we really do need to

2351
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,600
keep that top of mind as we think about

2352
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,639
this interop stuff

2353
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,719
all right one question for our matrix

2354
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,080
chat and then we'll get back into the

2355
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,440
live audience

2356
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,920
from idk igp

2357
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,600
what do you think will be the outcome of

2358
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,440
eu enforcement of the right of

2359
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,520
portability on the business viability of

2360
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,840
wild gardens and social media can walled

2361
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
gardens be legislated open by enforcing

2362
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,760
this right

2363
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,520
so i think the portability rights not

2364
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,560
much uh i think interoperability is but

2365
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,280
portability is like really just um

2366
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,600
like portability is super useful

2367
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,600
for static services right if you're like

2368
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,880
um a google photos user and there's like

2369
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,120
a one button one click button to become

2370
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,440
a flickr user say that's pretty that's

2371
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,719
pretty useful

2372
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:41,600
um

2373
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,120
or you know

2374
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,320
if you're like trying to take care of

2375
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,880
the digital assets of uh you know a

2376
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,400
parent who has died

2377
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,000
and you want to export all their posts

2378
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,440
and stick them on a thumb drive so you

2379
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,880
can look at them later portability is

2380
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,080
really useful

2381
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,199
but most of our networked activity is

2382
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,560
interactive

2383
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,159
you know portability is nice if you're

2384
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,080
talking about things like i can take my

2385
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,400
containerized cloud server

2386
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,960
and move it to a different host with

2387
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,360
minimal setup but portability for an

2388
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,520
individual user gets you very very

2389
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,320
little

2390
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,920
you want to really maintain the

2391
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,080
relationship right like if the reason

2392
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,080
you're on facebook is that your

2393
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,760
customers are there your community is

2394
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,560
there

2395
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,920
say you're um

2396
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,360
you've moved across the country or

2397
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,199
across the world for work or university

2398
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,400
and the way you stay in touch with your

2399
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,719
family is through facebook i actually

2400
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,639
have some family in south america who

2401
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,080
are going through tough times right now

2402
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,159
and i'm trying to help them out and

2403
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,760
everything there is done on whatsapp and

2404
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,280
i'm a zucker vegan and i don't have

2405
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,560
whatsapp because i don't use any

2406
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,320
facebook products and it's really hard

2407
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,719
right like that's the thing you lose

2408
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,800
uh when you leave a platform not just

2409
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,480
the data but the

2410
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,880
ongoing interaction and so that's why i

2411
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,440
think that interoperability uh and

2412
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,760
exposing apis and allowing for real-time

2413
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,280
exchange of data

2414
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,800
is far more important than interrupt

2415
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,480
interop is good or with the data

2416
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,080
portability data portability a really

2417
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,880
good way if we had interop to leave

2418
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,800
facebook and get set up on a diaspora or

2419
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,400
a mastodon instance and have an

2420
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,080
environment that has all your archives

2421
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,360
and stuff in it that would be great but

2422
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,560
portability beyond that is uh

2423
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,960
it's it's really like it's data at rest

2424
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,960
right and what what you need is the data

2425
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,280
and motion

2426
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,480
all right next question from the

2427
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,480
audience

2428
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,080
of course it's an honor to hear your

2429
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,480
talk today and super fan so i'm going to

2430
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,159
try not to do that

2431
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,159
um you did a great job and you've been

2432
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,600
talking for a really long time so here's

2433
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
my softball question i've been staring

2434
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,880
at your chair

2435
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,199
i have severe spinal issues can you tell

2436
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,719
me that you're kind to chair

2437
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,000
sure

2438
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,360
it's a it's a leap chair from steel case

2439
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,080
uh it's about five or six years old i uh

2440
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,159
this is my unpaid endorsement for leap

2441
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,120
chairs i had like fetishized leap chairs

2442
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,400
in um magazines for a long time uh and i

2443
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,679
tried them in showrooms but i couldn't

2444
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,080
afford them and in 2001 after the

2445
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,159
dot-com crash i was walking through the

2446
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,560
mission in san francisco and there was a

2447
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,199
guy on the street with 50 leaf chairs

2448
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,120
that he was selling for 50 bucks each

2449
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,280
still in their plastic wrap and he also

2450
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,600
had like 11 boxes of t-shirts for his

2451
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,600
failed.com it was very weird it was like

2452
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,280
it was like millionaires selling apples

2453
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,120
from the from their rolls-royces during

2454
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,639
the depression except for really good

2455
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,360
ergonomic chairs so i bought four of

2456
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,120
those and used them as my dining room

2457
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,760
chairs for like several years left san

2458
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,960
francisco

2459
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,960
flew one of them to london and used it

2460
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,760
in london for the next like 13 years

2461
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
moved back here and had another one and

2462
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,600
moved that one back here

2463
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,040
uh i forget where the other one went

2464
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,159
maybe it was in storage anyway

2465
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,000
eventually like after like literally 20

2466
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
years they fell apart and then i bought

2467
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,520
this one and i've had it for you know

2468
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,000
four or five years and it's great i i

2469
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,560
that is my unpaid endorsement of steel

2470
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,880
case leap chairs and i i sympathize with

2471
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,880
you for your spinal problems i had uh

2472
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,360
both of my hips replaced uh in the last

2473
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,840
year and um if you go to the internet

2474
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,760
archive and search for doctoro femur you

2475
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,159
can get a high-res uh laser scan

2476
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,800
creative common zero of my diseased

2477
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,320
arthritic femur that you can print

2478
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,440
yourself

2479
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,800
awesome

2480
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,639
thank you i am also a robot i have an

2481
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,880
implanted device so oh very good i have

2482
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,960
a lot of my issues thank you so much for

2483
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,960
your answer i'm glad to hear that yeah

2484
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,560
thank you cheers

2485
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,920
all right another audience question

2486
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,639
hey corey thanks for the good talk it's

2487
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,040
been great to see your ideas develop

2488
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,159
over the past couple of years on interop

2489
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,320
i uh with interrupt i'm thinking a lot

2490
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,199
about the way we produce data on the web

2491
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,120
and the relationship between data

2492
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,040
production and interoperability how do

2493
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,840
you view interoperability

2494
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,440
how do you view that interoperability

2495
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,920
sort of will impact or would impact

2496
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,560
that we produce data and how we might

2497
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,480
gain access and control over it i can

2498
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,960
see how interop might

2499
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,840
do really well at increasing access to

2500
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,760
data production the data we all produce

2501
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,760
and it produces value for advertising

2502
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,920
industries and for

2503
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,159
capital as we know it right now but i

2504
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,400
don't see a solution inside of interop

2505
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,880
for increased control over my data

2506
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,040
production um yeah and relatedly how it

2507
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,600
relates to the advertising industry

2508
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,760
you're absolutely right and i'm glad you

2509
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,239
brought that up i wrote a paper a year

2510
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,840
and a half ago that has been updated

2511
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,760
once and we're about to update it again

2512
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,760
with my colleague at eff bennett ciphers

2513
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,840
we actually do have a technologist at

2514
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,679
eff whose surname is ciphers which is

2515
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:34,960
just awesome

2516
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,520
and it's called privacy without monopoly

2517
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,080
and it's and it specifically addresses

2518
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,159
the relationship of interoperability and

2519
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,320
privacy and the argument from large

2520
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,280
firms

2521
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,480
that um interoperability presents uh uh

2522
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,320
data protection risks which it

2523
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,760
absolutely does

2524
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
and you know just as with the content

2525
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
moderation

2526
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,639
question

2527
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,199
it's it's not wrong to say that the

2528
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,120
firms sometimes do things that benefit

2529
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,320
their users

2530
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,880
the problem is that when

2531
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,400
that that it's entirely at their

2532
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,600
discretion

2533
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,400
so

2534
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,560
the data protection we get from facebook

2535
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,080
and we get a lot of data protection from

2536
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,920
facebook facebook really does stop a lot

2537
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,600
of people from exfol trading data from

2538
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,239
facebook is entirely

2539
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:19,920
dependent on whether facebook thinks

2540
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,679
that that is a kind of data protection

2541
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,080
that they that that you deserve and the

2542
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,440
one kind of data protection that

2543
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,719
facebook absolutely doesn't think you

2544
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:29,120
deserve is protection from its own data

2545
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,840
mining um they they

2546
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,679
may stop the next cambridge analytica

2547
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,360
but they won't stop the next internal

2548
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,360
project that exploits your data

2549
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,440
and and moreover all of the firms even

2550
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,800
the ones that have much better track

2551
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,360
records on data protection like apple

2552
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,560
routinely

2553
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,480
engage in um

2554
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,800
bad data handling conduct

2555
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,360
when it is in their own interests so you

2556
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,280
know apple talks a big game about

2557
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,719
end-to-end encryption

2558
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,520
and they did go to you know the court to

2559
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,920
fight the fbi when they were trying to

2560
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,480
back door ios to get access to the san

2561
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,800
bernardino shooters devices

2562
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,719
but when the chinese state said that

2563
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,800
they had to remove all the working vpns

2564
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,239
from the app store

2565
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,040
uh

2566
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,560
as a condition of remaining in the

2567
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,520
country so that the state could spy on

2568
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,080
chinese users and you know put them in

2569
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,560
gulags this was when a million uyghurs

2570
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,199
and turkic uh minorities in xinjiang

2571
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:25,360
province were being imprisoned

2572
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,840
um you know that that apple would go

2573
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,400
along with it right they weren't gonna

2574
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,560
let people mine your data to sell you a

2575
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,480
fidget spinner but they were

2576
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,320
happy to let the chinese government mine

2577
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,840
your data to figure out whether to

2578
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,040
torture you

2579
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,280
if the alternative was losing access to

2580
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,800
chinese manufacturing and chinese

2581
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,040
consumers and so

2582
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,199
we need something beyond the firm's

2583
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:48,400
goodwill

2584
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,239
and unilateral

2585
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,920
choices about when to protect our

2586
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,040
privacy

2587
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,600
and you know ultimately the you

2588
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,000
safeguard your rights not just with

2589
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,080
technology but with technology backstop

2590
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,360
by law you know as far back as the 1990s

2591
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,360
cryptographers were recognizing the

2592
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,159
rubber hose cryptanalysis problem that

2593
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,840
it didn't really matter

2594
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,120
how long your uh your your passphrase

2595
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,000
was or how many bits your key was or how

2596
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,639
robust your cipher was if it was lawful

2597
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,560
for the state to tie you to a chair and

2598
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,159
hit you with a rubber hose until you

2599
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,480
revealed that passphrase and that adding

2600
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,159
more bits would not help and so that

2601
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:27,280
ultimately

2602
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,080
the role of of encryption in human

2603
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,199
rights

2604
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,159
would be to create a space that was

2605
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,400
temporary at best where you could

2606
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
organize to demand

2607
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,000
human rights

2608
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,360
from the state

2609
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,600
and that ultimately is how we protect

2610
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,040
privacy

2611
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,199
and data rights online

2612
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,360
is to

2613
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,719
create

2614
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,560
good freestanding digital human rights

2615
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,320
laws a federal privacy law with a

2616
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,000
private right of action

2617
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,880
that

2618
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,520
applies equally to facebook or google or

2619
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,000
apple or microsoft or salesforce or any

2620
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,440
other big tech companies and the

2621
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,120
interoperators that interoperate with

2622
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,440
them you know facebook says we're not

2623
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,120
going to allow this company to plug into

2624
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,880
the api that we've been mandated because

2625
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,400
we think they have bad data handling

2626
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,239
practices

2627
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,880
we should be able to

2628
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,040
compare facebook's claims to an

2629
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,000
empirical standard that says what is and

2630
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,639
is not permissible data handling

2631
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,480
and the floor underneath it shouldn't be

2632
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,719
set by market forces but rather by

2633
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,960
democratically accountable law

2634
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,199
so as i mentioned we wrote this this

2635
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,360
paper privacy without monopoly and we

2636
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,520
wrote an appendix to it about how this

2637
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,120
plays out in the european union with the

2638
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:43,920
gdpr and how um upcoming european uh uh

2639
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,679
interoperability mandates in the digital

2640
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,480
markets act and the digital services act

2641
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,639
can uh interact or or lean on the

2642
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,760
gdpr the general data privacy regulation

2643
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,639
to

2644
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,719
create a regime in which we don't have

2645
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,320
to take the tech company's word for it

2646
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,840
when they say that they are defending

2647
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,719
our privacy uh or that you know the that

2648
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,239
uh someone else shouldn't be allowed in

2649
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,520
because they're they're not going to

2650
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,040
defend our privacy

2651
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:12,159
um and i'm i'm just finishing a draft

2652
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,960
uh a second appendix to this

2653
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,840
for the indian law review uh that makes

2654
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,199
reference to uh indian privacy law uh

2655
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,600
and um and it will talk about how this

2656
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,239
plays out in the global south so

2657
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,760
i think you're right

2658
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,679
that you know this does create new data

2659
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:30,960
flows and wherever there's new data

2660
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,800
flows there's new opportunities for bad

2661
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,520
data handling practices and and uh

2662
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,679
infringements on our data rights and i

2663
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,440
think that we don't fix that with

2664
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,920
technology we fix that by having

2665
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,600
democratically accountable entities that

2666
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,760
are stronger than the companies that can

2667
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,639
force the companies to behave themselves

2668
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,000
and by having remedies that are

2669
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,440
available to everyone through private

2670
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,880
rights of action this is one of the

2671
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,400
things that's really stalled the federal

2672
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,719
privacy bill that is has been on again

2673
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,639
off again all summer in dc

2674
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,000
is whether it will have a private right

2675
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,600
of action a private right of action is

2676
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,280
when

2677
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,600
if your rights are violated under a law

2678
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,840
you yourself can sue

2679
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,320
to have that law enforced and and you

2680
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,480
know more to the point eff can sue on

2681
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,120
your behalf or the aclu can or or

2682
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,600
uh you know public citizen can or some

2683
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,600
other activist group can

2684
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,120
as opposed to laws that don't have a

2685
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,719
private right of action which are only

2686
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,280
enforced by prosecutors where you have

2687
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,199
to hope that

2688
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,679
someone who works for the government

2689
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,440
decides that your rights are worth

2690
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,400
defending and if they don't then you're

2691
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,520
out of luck

2692
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,120
and um

2693
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,040
that is i think has been a major defect

2694
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,280
in a lot of privacy laws

2695
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,199
uh and a lot of human rights laws more

2696
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,040
generally and when you hear about human

2697
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,719
rights laws that have gone nowhere it is

2698
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,400
often because they didn't have a private

2699
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,800
right of action and you know the the

2700
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,239
people who oppose private rights of

2701
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,440
action

2702
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,760
tend to make a lot of kind of tort

2703
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,920
reform noises about nuisance lawsuits

2704
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,760
and how companies will attract all kinds

2705
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,440
of bottom feeder 1 800 lawyer types and

2706
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,440
you know there's ways to devise laws

2707
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,360
that that prevent that from happening

2708
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,440
you know where you can have early

2709
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,960
showings of fact

2710
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,280
like like the slap laws that protect

2711
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,520
journalists and public speakers

2712
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,800
you can have you can have a rule that

2713
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,480
says if you can show facts early on in

2714
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,400
the court case that say that you were

2715
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,080
doing something in in the public

2716
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,000
interest and that this is this is about

2717
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,199
shutting you up um then you know you are

2718
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,840
uh immunized from further litigation and

2719
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,239
and you can get your fees back um that

2720
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,880
is a very powerful uh legal tool that

2721
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,080
stops even uh deep pocketed adversaries

2722
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,800
from ruining you in court i was recently

2723
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
um

2724
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,719
had a fight picked with me on twitter by

2725
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,400
a thin-skinned billionaire who runs a

2726
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,840
credit card company which in which i i

2727
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,600
you know sort of made him look like a

2728
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,480
fool

2729
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,239
and then his lawyers threatened to sue

2730
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,280
me

2731
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,159
unless i retracted my statements and i

2732
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,080
was able to get a first amendment lawyer

2733
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,679
to send them a very stiff letter

2734
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,960
reminding them that we all live in

2735
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,560
california which is a very powerful

2736
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,199
anti-slap law and discussing exactly how

2737
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,800
much money he could extract from them in

2738
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,719
fees if they were dumb enough to go

2739
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,080
ahead with this and how stupid they

2740
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,920
would look and what the streisand effect

2741
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,280
was and they just went away with their

2742
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,040
tail between their legs so

2743
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,119
you can design laws

2744
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:19,920
that

2745
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,719
don't allow for this kind of abuse

2746
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,480
it just takes careful design

2747
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,159
and so i think that is ultimately how we

2748
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:28,400
defend our privacy rights is by creating

2749
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,560
legal rights to privacy not just privacy

2750
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,760
technology

2751
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,719
but legal rights that give you an area

2752
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:35,920
of redress

2753
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,840
if your privacy is violated

2754
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,960
thanks

2755
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,800
all right we have another matrix

2756
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,080
question

2757
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,920
can you speak more to any com-com

2758
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,239
implications for long-term digital asset

2759
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,080
preservation in terms of either public

2760
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,800
good i.e libraries and the private good

2761
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,480
i.e families and our friends wishing to

2762
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,920
preserve the memories and digital

2763
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,840
artifacts and deceased individuals

2764
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,159
who've authorized their access

2765
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,800
yeah a hundred percent you know i got my

2766
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,800
start in the tech industry programming

2767
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,840
cd-roms for voyager and hyper talk right

2768
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,800
like

2769
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,800
talk about dead platforms but you can

2770
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,840
run all of those programs in a browser

2771
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,719
that can simulate a 68k mac in

2772
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,320
javascript right the the implication of

2773
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,960
the universal turing machine is that you

2774
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,960
can nest them as deep as you need to go

2775
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,880
you can emulate any technology that you

2776
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,280
need there's there's this weird

2777
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,880
story that we tell ourselves about

2778
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,719
obsolete data

2779
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,320
and when you hear about obsolete data

2780
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,760
and like oh they couldn't recover this

2781
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,000
file this file anymore and and you know

2782
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,320
this all this data they created is lost

2783
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
and you drill into the story

2784
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
it's almost never about obsolete data

2785
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,280
it's usually about obsolete storage and

2786
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,679
specifically about storage media that is

2787
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,440
fragile and has decomposed over the

2788
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,000
years because generally if you've got

2789
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,760
data in a

2790
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,880
you know fail failure resistant ssd

2791
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,159
that

2792
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,320
you know is part of an array that makes

2793
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,800
backups and so on the data itself is

2794
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,920
pretty safe

2795
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,840
and understanding the data structures

2796
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,520
you know if they're documented it's it's

2797
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,719
very straightforward but even if they're

2798
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,480
not documented especially older data

2799
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,520
structures

2800
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,520
because the computers themselves were so

2801
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,679
limited those data structures are i

2802
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:18,400
don't know

2803
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,840
trivialize the work of the people who do

2804
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,000
it but they're tractable to reverse

2805
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,320
engineer and build viewers for and even

2806
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
when they're not you can just fire up

2807
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,600
vms

2808
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,000
that you know emulate the processor run

2809
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,679
the operating system

2810
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:34,320
uh and then launch the application

2811
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,199
and

2812
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:36,400
you know the

2813
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,600
the story of our data going bad

2814
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,080
uh is really a story about the fragility

2815
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,360
of media

2816
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,679
and the use of the law to block

2817
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,199
interoperability

2818
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,159
and not about the data itself the data

2819
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:52,000
is effectively immortal the logo

2820
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,920
programs i wrote on an apple ii plus in

2821
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,560
1979 run on the ubuntu computer that i'm

2822
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,800
speaking to you from now

2823
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,760
decades later and they run very well

2824
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,360
there's just no problem i actually just

2825
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:08,639
had to do um for a book cover i was

2826
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,560
having a book cover discussion with my

2827
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,239
publisher and i said what if we

2828
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,639
replicate an old browser window and i

2829
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,560
went and i launched

2830
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,840
in a in in my own browser window i

2831
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,480
launched a version of

2832
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,480
ncsa mosaic

2833
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,600
from the early 1990s and then it

2834
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,000
retrieved a web page from the internet

2835
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,239
archive and rend from that was

2836
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,719
contemporaneous with it and rendered it

2837
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,639
and then i could like toggle back and

2838
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:38,000
forth between different browser

2839
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,480
renderers different vms different

2840
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,880
captures of this file and see how it

2841
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,800
rendered in all these different ways and

2842
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,199
and it was all being done without

2843
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,760
pegging even one of the cores on my

2844
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,600
little consumer laptop

2845
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,760
uh you know the the marvelous thing

2846
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,679
about the incredible increasing power of

2847
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,080
computation is that simulating older

2848
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,080
computers even it doesn't have to be

2849
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,320
done very efficiently that you have lots

2850
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,239
and lots and lots of headroom you know

2851
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:07,040
that i just saw a headline that was so

2852
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,800
weird and good that i i couldn't bring

2853
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,639
myself to go and find out what it meant

2854
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,880
but it was man figures out how to play

2855
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,440
doom inside of doom which i assume means

2856
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,080
that like they implemented doom on a vm

2857
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,400
inside of doom or something and and

2858
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,239
that's the amazing and wonderful and

2859
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,320
magical thing about living in an era of

2860
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,520
exponential

2861
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,760
increase in computing power

2862
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,800
is that

2863
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,880
you know you can kind of suck at making

2864
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,520
emulators and still emulate very well so

2865
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,960
yeah i think that that it's really

2866
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,199
interoperability is key to our

2867
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,560
preservation because it's not

2868
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,639
interoperability to open the file and

2869
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,400
save it again in a new file format or

2870
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,920
it's not preservation rather to open the

2871
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,520
file and save it again in a new file

2872
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,800
format that's like saying well we saved

2873
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,440
the mona lisa by photocopying it right

2874
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,360
preservation is seeing things in in

2875
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,600
their original context as well as in

2876
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,480
modern ones and you know the best chance

2877
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,639
we have of recovering those original

2878
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,480
contexts and sharing them widely is

2879
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,880
through emulation

2880
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,639
all right thank you to another live

2881
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,960
question

2882
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,920
thank you very much for the great talk

2883
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,320
so if somebody 100 understands and

2884
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,040
believes in your vision and they had a

2885
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,040
lot of money to be able to spend target

2886
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,360
whether through grants to open source

2887
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,520
projects or investments in alternative

2888
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,040
platforms where should they be putting

2889
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,600
their money so that they could uh see

2890
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,840
your vision come to fruition i'm a

2891
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,119
director at a engineering and venture

2892
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,880
capital and philanthropy organization

2893
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,480
that has helped my organization in the

2894
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,239
past and we want to be able to see this

2895
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,080
kind of future of more people having

2896
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,600
freedom over their devices freedom over

2897
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,119
the where they post their content and

2898
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,040
platforms into the future and they

2899
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,960
really want to know where would their

2900
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,119
money best be spent to see a positive

2901
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,199
outcome here if their concern is a

2902
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:50,639
positive outcome and a freedom-loving

2903
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:52,080
outcome more so than just making their

2904
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,280
money back

2905
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,199
yeah that's a great question

2906
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,040
uh and those theory change questions

2907
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,400
they're um

2908
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,400
they're really gnarly and they keep me

2909
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,840
up at night

2910
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,159
uh

2911
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,080
so lawrence lessig uh

2912
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,239
has this idea that our our world is

2913
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:11,360
governed by four forces uh code which is

2914
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,239
like what's technologically possible law

2915
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:17,040
what's lawfully permissible norms what's

2916
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,719
socially acceptable

2917
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,280
and markets what's profitable

2918
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,239
and

2919
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,360
you're kind of saying well what if we

2920
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,880
took the markets out of it what are the

2921
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,159
other interventions we could make

2922
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,159
although maybe markets too

2923
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:29,360
depending

2924
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,040
and

2925
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,679
you know one of the implications for me

2926
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,440
about this idea that we have these sort

2927
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,280
of four cardinal directions that we can

2928
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,480
move in

2929
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,679
is that

2930
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,159
if you find yourself unable to make an

2931
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,520
intervention

2932
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,880
in the domain that you're most

2933
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,639
comfortable with right like if you just

2934
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,719
every program you want to write

2935
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,199
that would make things better

2936
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,520
you know interoperability wise would

2937
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,679
just land you in jail then maybe what

2938
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,199
you need to do

2939
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:57,920
is

2940
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,960
instead

2941
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,400
write

2942
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,719
you know write checks to

2943
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,880
lawmakers or to activist groups that are

2944
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,960
lobbying to reform those laws or maybe

2945
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,480
what you need to do is launch a

2946
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,400
publicity campaign that makes people

2947
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,360
aware

2948
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,880
of what they're losing because you know

2949
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,639
people just don't understand what an

2950
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:16,239
interoperable internet would look like

2951
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,679
there there's a whole generation that

2952
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,440
has just grown up within these walled

2953
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,600
gardens i am

2954
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,199
i

2955
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,560
spent a lot of time when the european

2956
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,840
union announced that there they were

2957
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,719
going to start their their

2958
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,960
interoperability mandates uh in the

2959
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,480
digital markets act with end-to-end

2960
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,320
encrypted messengers i spent a lot of

2961
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,000
time asking myself like why are they

2962
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,080
doing this with eden

2963
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,280
messengers

2964
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,080
and i i concluded after talking to some

2965
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,440
people in brussels that it's because

2966
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,199
like none of them have ever experienced

2967
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,800
federated conversation like none of them

2968
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,639
were ever you know unused net say or

2969
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,480
fidonet none like they literally just

2970
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,800
can't imagine it whereas

2971
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,639
they've all got sms right they all know

2972
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,000
what it's like to be like a german

2973
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
lawmaker in brussels who takes out your

2974
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,960
phone and sends a text to you know a

2975
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,679
dutch colleague on holiday in spain

2976
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:04,560
and

2977
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,320
you know it just works and they're like

2978
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,600
how hard can it be to build an

2979
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,440
interoperable messenger what they're

2980
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,719
missing is that you know the reason we

2981
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,719
want to replace sms is because it's a

2982
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,520
dumpster fire and you know sms works

2983
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,800
great if you don't care about how it

2984
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,639
fails if you do care about how it fails

2985
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,159
sms is terrible and and so um you know

2986
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,199
you might want to make a public

2987
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,600
information campaign to try and

2988
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,520
make people aware of what they've lost

2989
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,840
through a couple of lost decades of

2990
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,760
large firms being able to foreclose on

2991
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,600
new market entrance and and

2992
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,280
interoperability

2993
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,320
and so

2994
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,760
um

2995
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,760
you know those and and you know you also

2996
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,239
want me might want to make grants to

2997
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,000
tech non-profits that are doing

2998
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,119
interoperability work so for example the

2999
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,920
main core developer on pidgin which is

3000
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,920
you know the the latest incarnation of

3001
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,920
xmpp which holds together a bunch of

3002
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,080
other protocols and works with matrix

3003
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,920
which is a great a great platform i

3004
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,600
understand we're using it here today but

3005
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,960
but pigeon's a really interesting

3006
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,040
example because there's one developer he

3007
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,280
was like working for big tech companies

3008
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,199
and he he saved up a bunch of money and

3009
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,480
he was like if i move back to the

3010
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,159
midwest i can live on like 18 000 a year

3011
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,600
and i can spend like the next three

3012
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,239
years just hacking on xmpp just hacking

3013
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,159
on pidgeon making it better which is

3014
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:19,760
what he's doing

3015
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,320
and uh he's running out of money and the

3016
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,119
thing that really got to him

3017
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,880
was that one of the companies that makes

3018
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,320
cyber weapons

3019
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,639
uh you know a company that makes tools

3020
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,719
uh for lawful interception like the nso

3021
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,400
group posted a 100 000 bounty

3022
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,679
for bugs

3023
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,920
in his code so that they could write

3024
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,560
exploits for it and spy on him

3025
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,480
and spy on his his millions of users so

3026
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,159
there's one guy supporting millions of

3027
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,199
users

3028
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,639
and so you know if you wanted to spread

3029
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,159
your money around you could go and you

3030
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,400
could find these individuals who are

3031
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,920
maintaining this public interest

3032
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,760
internet code and just give them enough

3033
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,239
money to hire a couple of of colleagues

3034
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,480
and you know pay their bills and not

3035
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,760
have to worry about these hundred

3036
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,520
thousand dollar bounties you know not

3037
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,119
not being horribly outmatched by these

3038
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:06,800
hundred thousand dollar bounties and

3039
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,080
there are a bunch of these these little

3040
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,679
projects you may remember after snowden

3041
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,119
came in from the cold and it was

3042
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,360
revealed that he'd used enigmail

3043
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,320
to uh as the front end for gpg for his

3044
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,520
email

3045
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,440
that there was like one guy in germany

3046
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,360
who worked on it as a hobby and that

3047
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,239
everyone who's using gpg with an igmail

3048
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,960
in the world was reliant on this one

3049
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,239
person's

3050
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:30,800
spare time to make it work and you know

3051
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,440
to their credit a bunch of uh firms that

3052
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,840
use those tools then threw some money at

3053
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,280
him so that he's got like i think he's

3054
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,880
got a helper now but it's still it's

3055
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,560
just a couple of people so there are a

3056
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:41,920
bunch of those projects you could you

3057
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,159
could track down and throw some money at

3058
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,520
um

3059
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,320
the on the public information side

3060
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,000
there's a lot more of this stuff going

3061
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,800
on now and and certainly like there are

3062
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,360
big tech funded packs like facebook just

3063
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,000
ran these these incredible scare ads

3064
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,480
about about the access act and other

3065
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,480
interoperability and anti-trust laws in

3066
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,800
congress where it's just like if if we

3067
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,239
allow

3068
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:08,719
you know the american congress to weaken

3069
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:12,320
facebook china will invade america right

3070
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,760
and that was like that was their their

3071
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,360
whole pitch and you know certainly like

3072
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,199
finding organizations that want to run

3073
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,199
counter ads to that would be really good

3074
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:23,679
especially if you focused them in in

3075
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,679
dc and you know and in swing states and

3076
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:27,679
in races where it mattered and in

3077
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,440
races for the

3078
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,520
chairmanship of the committee relevant

3079
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,440
committees and so on that would be a

3080
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,560
good way to affect norms

3081
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,000
if you wanted to

3082
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,520
affect law

3083
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:43,760
uh you know the there are there's um

3084
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,600
there's gonna be a lot of need for

3085
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,560
funding

3086
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,440
uh

3087
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,760
public interest uh

3088
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,639
and groups to participate in standards

3089
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,199
making around the access act and the

3090
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,960
digital markets act so you know all of

3091
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,719
these these tech mandates are going to

3092
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,639
are going to result in

3093
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,080
some kind of standard setting

3094
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,520
organization some kind of standard

3095
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,520
setting effort and you know this is the

3096
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,080
kind of incredibly boring

3097
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,560
offs off-screen

3098
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,600
uh super important deep structural work

3099
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,600
that if it goes wrong is going to be

3100
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,360
really hard to remediate

3101
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,400
and so you know if the committee

3102
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,159
that writes the standard for

3103
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,880
interoperable facebook is like 400

3104
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,440
facebook lawyers and engineers

3105
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,320
one you know overseer from nist

3106
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,960
and like two academics and one person

3107
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,480
from a startup

3108
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,000
that standard is going to be completely

3109
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,639
useless so creating grants to send

3110
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,520
people to those committees is is an area

3111
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,000
where you could make a huge difference

3112
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,480
and having done a lot of time as in in

3113
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,560
public interest standard setting it is

3114
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,480
like the most thankless and impossible

3115
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,199
work and you're so outgunned and having

3116
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,800
more money to bring people in would have

3117
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,320
made a huge difference you know there

3118
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,400
were there was often the case where i

3119
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,760
would have loved to have brought in an

3120
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,400
academic or an activist who works on

3121
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,480
disability rights uh to come and

3122
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:07,520
participate in standard settings uh but

3123
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,520
you know i couldn't pay them and they

3124
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,159
needed they couldn't afford to volunteer

3125
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,320
their time so that's an area where you

3126
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,760
could make a really big difference on

3127
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,400
the on the tech side uh so let's see

3128
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,840
where we at norms laws code

3129
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,480
and uh markets so and and market

3130
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,560
participants so there are firms that are

3131
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,679
trying to do

3132
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:29,520
really interesting things with interop

3133
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,400
um

3134
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,239
i've been talking with these folks at a

3135
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:35,040
company called pera they're a startup

3136
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,960
they're funded by um union square

3137
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,560
ventures the folks who backed

3138
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,080
kickstarter and a bunch of other

3139
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,599
startups that have gone on to like do

3140
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:43,440
sort of public interest work

3141
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,159
and uh pera they reverse engineered the

3142
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,800
doordash app that dashers use that's

3143
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,480
what doordash is cute named for their

3144
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,679
gig workers

3145
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:53,920
um and and the app

3146
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,560
um hid the tip from them so if you

3147
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,119
booked a food delivery and you said you

3148
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,360
know i'll pay like a ten dollar tip the

3149
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,040
driver wouldn't be able to see the tip

3150
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,119
until they made the delivery and what

3151
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,560
that meant because so much of the

3152
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,320
compensation for the driver comes out of

3153
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,920
the tip

3154
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,719
they

3155
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,880
wouldn't know if the run was profitable

3156
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,199
until after they made the run

3157
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,639
right and

3158
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,080
that was

3159
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,080
a way for

3160
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,480
doordash to get their drivers to

3161
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,280
subsidize unprofitable runs so doordash

3162
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,960
wanted to you know blitz scale they

3163
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,800
wanted to grow their business by

3164
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,719
offering below cost deliveries to

3165
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,040
customers because like who wouldn't

3166
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,480
use a service

3167
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,800
that costs you less to use than it costs

3168
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,199
to actually deliver and by hiding the

3169
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,199
tip amounts from the drivers they were

3170
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:42,880
able to like effectively operate them

3171
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,360
like blind boxes right uh you know and

3172
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,520
turn them into like make make doing runs

3173
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,520
into a slot machine maybe maybe this run

3174
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,800
will make you a lot of money or maybe

3175
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,800
you'll lose four bucks who knows

3176
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,080
and

3177
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,599
it turned out that the way that they

3178
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:58,159
relayed these messages to the doordash

3179
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:59,280
app

3180
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,280
that the drivers had is they would send

3181
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,719
them like a json file or an xml file and

3182
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,639
within it it would have like the full

3183
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:08,880
tip amount field and then would have a

3184
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,440
flag that said do not display

3185
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,119
and so pera

3186
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:14,560
wrote an app

3187
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,960
that would intercept that message

3188
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,880
and display the tip amount that was

3189
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,520
otherwise hidden and doordash accused

3190
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,360
them of hacking the app they said they

3191
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,719
were going to steal drivers social

3192
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,639
security numbers with it they said they

3193
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,280
were violating the dmca they just like

3194
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,599
went all out on them and then they

3195
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,040
finally like did the one thing that

3196
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,480
actually would work which is they

3197
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,560
stopped transmitting the full tip amount

3198
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,280
in the clear and now they encrypt it but

3199
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,840
pera and doordash are now actually like

3200
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,360
locked in this um

3201
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,040
war with one another where every time

3202
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,119
doordash ships an update parachutes an

3203
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,119
update to break it and they just did

3204
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,800
para just did some public communications

3205
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,159
around this where they said like we are

3206
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:52,960
now

3207
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,880
facing like the full engineering might

3208
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,800
of doordash they they they've now made

3209
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,040
their number one engineering priority

3210
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,719
making it so that drivers can't figure

3211
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,199
out what they're getting paid uh and

3212
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,880
blocking our app and they're throwing

3213
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,719
more and more engineering time at it we

3214
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:07,679
you know

3215
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,360
we might reach the edge of our ability

3216
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,280
to do this you know if you wanted to

3217
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,119
throw some money at a firm

3218
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:15,199
not for profit but for

3219
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,440
uh for just to help them do the right

3220
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,040
thing you could give them enough money

3221
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,719
to hire more engineers because you know

3222
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:22,560
in general they have an inter-operator's

3223
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,360
defense or an inter-operator's advantage

3224
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,199
right which is that doordash has to make

3225
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,880
no mistakes and they just have to find

3226
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,440
one mistake but you know doordash has

3227
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,440
billions of dollars in capital

3228
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,280
um they can just throw a lot of

3229
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,639
engineers at

3230
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,880
patching and repatching and repatching

3231
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,960
and it becomes a war of attrition

3232
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,960
where still pera has the advantage if

3233
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,639
they can access capital as well so that

3234
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,000
might be an area where you could work in

3235
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,760
markets to do things so i don't think

3236
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,920
there's just like one way to get there

3237
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,679
i think you go as far as you can with

3238
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:53,679
code and then if you hit a wall you're

3239
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,119
like well what can i do with norms or

3240
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,639
what can i do with markets or what can i

3241
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,560
do with law and then if you know the

3242
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,840
legal process stalls out you're like

3243
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,239
well what code can i write and and going

3244
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,679
around and around like that is how you

3245
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:04,960
make the difference

3246
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,960
thank you

3247
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,159
all right i know we're eight minutes

3248
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,080
before the hour corey do you want to

3249
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,840
take one more question or yeah that'd be

3250
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,280
fine okay we've got one last question

3251
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,840
from the audience

3252
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,520
hello this is a question about the

3253
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,320
upstream incentives for interoperability

3254
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,599
and how technology affects those

3255
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,119
upstream incentives

3256
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:26,800
so with distributed autonomous

3257
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,040
organizations projects like orbit other

3258
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,040
things where you have notions of digital

3259
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,800
sovereignty being promoted very

3260
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,360
intensely

3261
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,520
do you see this as being a possible

3262
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,760
route forwards for interoperability or

3263
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,280
do you think that they really have to

3264
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,400
attack

3265
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,320
not attack really have to address it

3266
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,560
with the current super majors or can

3267
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,880
future technological opportunities

3268
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,119
dissolve the network effect monopoly

3269
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,000
which current uh social media majors

3270
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,760
have

3271
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,000
well i think that the

3272
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,239
nature of the institution is less

3273
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,599
important i mean

3274
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:04,880
you could you could say well what if

3275
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,040
it's a dow and i know that like dao can

3276
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,480
encapsulate lots of different kinds of

3277
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,000
organizations but like let's say it's a

3278
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,440
good dow full of public interested

3279
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,440
people with a good governance model you

3280
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,119
could replace that with a cooperative or

3281
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:17,360
a non-profit or you know a

3282
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,119
group of tinkers or whatever they would

3283
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:20,800
still all have the same problem which is

3284
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,880
switching costs that until we address

3285
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,960
the interoperability question

3286
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,400
the um

3287
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,400
the fact that everyone is already on

3288
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,320
these big platforms inside these walled

3289
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,880
gardens makes it a non-starter you know

3290
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,119
when facebook started

3291
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,800
marks or not when they started but when

3292
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,080
they went public right when they went to

3293
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,000
the when they went beyond universities

3294
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,840
and said anyone can join even if you

3295
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,520
have don't have a dot edu account you

3296
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,520
get a facebook account that a really big

3297
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:46,800
problem which is that everyone who

3298
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
wanted to use a general purpose social

3299
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,800
media network already had an account on

3300
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,159
myspace which was owned by this

3301
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:54,480
rapacious billionaire rupert murdoch was

3302
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,239
not going to let them go right he had

3303
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,080
them locked in pretty thoroughly

3304
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,920
and you know what facebook did is they

3305
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,239
it's rather than saying to people

3306
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,800
we have a better service all that it

3307
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,880
lacks is everyone you want to talk to

3308
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,320
why don't you just come here and twiddle

3309
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,800
your thumbs until they decide to leave

3310
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,400
or trying to organize a like

3311
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,400
international everyone quits myspace and

3312
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,320
goes to facebook day next wednesday at 2

3313
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,080
p.m

3314
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,080
what they did was they created like a

3315
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,000
bot that you could give your myspace

3316
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,440
credentials to

3317
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,000
switch to facebook and it would go log

3318
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,960
into myspace's you scrape your inbox

3319
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,880
stick them in your facebook inbox scrape

3320
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,560
your communities stick them in your

3321
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,320
facebook communities let you reply to

3322
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,679
them and then it would like autopilot

3323
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,679
those responses back out again to

3324
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:39,040
myspace

3325
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,639
so it meant that you didn't have to

3326
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,239
choose between using the service that

3327
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,400
was run by people you liked more and you

3328
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,400
know we forget this but in the early

3329
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,800
days facebook's pitch was we are the

3330
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,960
privacy respecting alternative

3331
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,520
and myspace will sell your data facebook

3332
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,040
won't that was their that was their

3333
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,440
promise when they lured people in

3334
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,119
uh and and

3335
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,560
you didn't have to choose between the

3336
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,719
privacy respecting community or the

3337
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:04,639
privacy respecting platform and the

3338
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:06,239
communities you belong to you could

3339
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:07,599
access the communities you belong to

3340
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,320
from the privacy respecting platform and

3341
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,480
you know as a technical matter i think

3342
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,239
it's not hard to build interoperable

3343
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,320
bridges into these services we can you

3344
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:17,679
know hack them in

3345
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,360
using bots using

3346
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,320
scrapers using reverse engineering

3347
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,000
but to make that sustainable we also

3348
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
have to make it legal because otherwise

3349
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,040
they will

3350
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,880
skip past the building full of engineers

3351
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,719
go to the building full of lawyers and

3352
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,520
reduce you to a smoking crater

3353
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,719
and if we can make the

3354
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,320
if we can put you on a sound legal

3355
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,360
footing

3356
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,239
then

3357
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,000
you can build the bridge whether you're

3358
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,960
running a dower co-op or whatever

3359
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,679
you can build a bridge that lets people

3360
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,840
have one foot in facebook and one foot

3361
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,920
in your new service

3362
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,360
and not have to choose between the

3363
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,159
people that matter to them and a service

3364
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,040
whose

3365
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,760
operating ethos is more preferable to

3366
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,840
them you know my my

3367
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,000
grandmother was a soviet refugee she was

3368
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,040
a

3369
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,719
child civil defense worker basically

3370
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:08,880
child soldier in the siege of leningrad

3371
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,400
and you know for three years hauled

3372
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,560
bodies and brought ammunition up to the

3373
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,840
front and then went to um siberia over

3374
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,760
the winter ice met my grandfather got

3375
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,920
knocked up they deserted and went to

3376
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,480
azerbaijan my dad was born and then they

3377
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:25,199
crossed europe got to a displaced person

3378
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:26,880
boat and came to canada that's how i

3379
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
became a canadian that's why i wasn't

3380
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,960
raised in russia and my grandmother was

3381
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,639
the only one her family stayed behind in

3382
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,000
leningrad uh and she lost contact with

3383
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
them for 15 years my dad has this

3384
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,760
incredible story about

3385
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,080
you know one day the phone rang in their

3386
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:44,159
house in toronto and my grandmother

3387
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,400
picked it up and said mama mama and

3388
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,239
burst into tears

3389
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:49,440
she she didn't know if her mother was

3390
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,960
dead or alive

3391
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,520
and you know i often ask her like

3392
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,840
why did you go

3393
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,239
and and i often wondered why they why

3394
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:00,320
the other one stayed

3395
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,400
and she said you know they they stayed

3396
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,960
because leaving meant losing everything

3397
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,880
everything you owned every social

3398
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,119
connection you had maybe never making

3399
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:11,040
contact with everyone you loved in the

3400
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,679
world losing them forever right the

3401
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,280
switching costs of leaving the soviet

3402
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,960
union were really high

3403
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,040
you know and in the chaos after the war

3404
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,639
a lot of people could have done what my

3405
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:22,719
grandparents did and didn't

3406
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:24,639
they they stayed put

3407
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,719
because even though

3408
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:28,320
there were enormous problems with

3409
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,760
staying where they were

3410
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,599
the cost of leaving was so high that

3411
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:33,840
they they couldn't bear it and even if

3412
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,440
they had cause to regret that choice

3413
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,679
later on it just got worse and worse

3414
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,679
harder and harder to leave because they

3415
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:41,440
were in this mutual hostage-taking

3416
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,679
situation where i couldn't leave because

3417
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:44,800
you wouldn't leave and you couldn't

3418
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,800
leave because i wouldn't leave

3419
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,840
and giving people the tools to leave

3420
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,000
easily right if you think about

3421
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,080
what the relatively open borders of the

3422
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,639
european union mean today where you know

3423
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:59,599
if you leave berlin like the former east

3424
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,679
germany used to say that the reason the

3425
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:03,280
berlin wall was there was not to keep

3426
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,199
east germans in it was to keep everyone

3427
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,679
out of the workers paradise right

3428
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,560
today if you grew up in berlin

3429
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,800
you can like try going to paris and

3430
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,880
getting a job in a cafe

3431
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,360
and you know you can like zoom with your

3432
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,440
family every night and you can stay on

3433
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,000
sms or you know whatsapp and your family

3434
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,080
groups and you can even tune into the

3435
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,000
radio station back home and just stream

3436
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,599
it wherever you are and if you don't

3437
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:29,040
like it you can go back right you just

3438
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,560
get on the train you go back it's really

3439
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,599
easy

3440
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,199
and you compare that to what it's like

3441
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,440
when the switching costs are high

3442
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,040
and the extent to which people end up

3443
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,480
choosing things that they don't like

3444
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,719
right that aren't optimal for them like

3445
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:42,320
it's like like people continuing to

3446
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,000
smoke and saying i wish i could quit

3447
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
these things but the switching costs are

3448
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,760
so high when the switching costs are

3449
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,560
high people get stuck in situations

3450
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,119
that make them miserable that bring them

3451
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:54,800
to harm every day

3452
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,159
and building a better alternative

3453
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,599
somewhere else doesn't change the

3454
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,080
switching costs you have to knock down

3455
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,360
the walls

3456
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,400
and the way that we're going to knock

3457
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,320
down the walls is with a combination of

3458
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,239
technology and law we're going to make

3459
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,880
the world safe for hackers who want to

3460
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,760
open things up and give users autonomy

3461
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,480
and we're gonna that and then the people

3462
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,480
like you at this conference

3463
