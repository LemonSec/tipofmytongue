00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,400
check check

5
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
hey everyone how's it going

6
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
good hell yeah

7
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
can we give a hand for everyone who has

8
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,520
put together this amazing

9
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
conference

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
thank you guys so much uh

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
i'm uh i'm really excited to uh to talk

12
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,759
and hope again i haven't haven't been

13
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
able to do a presentation here since

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
2016. so it's been a while

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
um but uh yeah it's uh it's it's good to

16
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
be back and uh it's just it's just good

17
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
to be back with uh with with everyone

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
here i'm i'm really excited to do this

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
today so thanks for uh thanks for

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,360
showing up this is like such a cool

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
theater i love this place this is

22
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,479
awesome

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,360
um

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
all right so uh they say you're always

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
supposed to uh open up a presentation

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,319
with a joke um so i apologize for the

27
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
joke that's about to come

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,959
um

29
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,640
they say there are three types of people

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
in this world

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
those who understand quantum computing

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
those who do not understand quantum

33
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
computing and those who both

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
simultaneously understand quantum

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
computing and do not understand quantum

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
computing

37
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
uh so

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
unfortunately i i have to come clean

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
with you guys i am one of the third type

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
right i i both do and do not understand

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
quantum computing and i feel like the

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
more i learn about quantum computing the

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
less i actually understand sometimes um

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
but uh my goal today is

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
is to

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
well

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
before i say my goal is let me give you

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
a quick disclaimer at the start of the

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
presentation which is that i am not an

50
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
expert on quantum computing or quantum

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
physics or quantum mechanics in fact

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
what i don't know about these topics has

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,720
already filled several libraries

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,440
so if i'm not an expert why am i doing

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,599
this talk at hope today that's a good

56
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,560
question

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
because a few years ago

58
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
i thought i might never be able to use a

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
quantum computer

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
and now

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
i already have

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,159
so

63
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
that's the reason it seems a little

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
ridiculous

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
but when i when i first started learning

66
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
about quantum computing i thought it was

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
kind of like reading and wired in 1980

68
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,080
like 1998 about how they were going to

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
be nanobots in your bloodstream and they

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,159
were going to clean everything out you

71
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,360
know what i mean kind of like that

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
vaporware idea that was really cool at

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
the time

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,239
you know i thought quantum computing was

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,959
about as real as those nanobots or

76
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
flying cars or whatever right

77
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,360
it was stuff that people were

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
experimenting with but not

79
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
something you could actually use in real

80
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
life

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
i was wrong and that's why i decided to

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,879
do this talk

83
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,599
because the democratization of quantum

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,760
computing means that if you want to use

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
a quantum computer today you can

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,798
that's the coolest part

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
the reason i wanted to do the talk is

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,519
not because i know everything about

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
quantum computing in fact i know a

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
sliver of a sliver about it right but i

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
think i know just about enough to get to

92
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
the really smart people in this room who

93
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,520
know more than me

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
and who will get really excited about

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
some of this stuff and can actually code

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
it and can actually do it so you know

97
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,919
some sometimes um sometimes you point

98
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
people towards things instead of

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,199
actually doing it yourself and i feel

100
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
like that's part of what my presentation

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
is designed to do

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
because i know how many brilliant people

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,639
there are at this conference and i bet

104
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
that you can do this way better than i

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
can so i wanted to show you that quantum

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
computing is something you can actually

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
achieve today

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,759
uh

109
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
and

110
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
you know i i want to tell you that you

111
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,840
and virtually anyone in the world who

112
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
wants to learn to code for quantum

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
computers

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
can do it today and you know what most

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
of it is actually free and we have the

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
open source community to thank for that

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
there are so many great open source free

118
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
tools that you can use

119
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,560
sdks um actual actual quantum computing

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
systems that you can use today

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
that will allow you to interact with

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
this world

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
so let's go ahead and talk through some

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
of this stuff

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
it's hard to know where to start with

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
quantum because it is really really

127
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
complex right

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,759
um

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,560
so

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
i was kind of thinking where should i

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
start when talking about quantum

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
computing well sometimes when i start

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
learning about a difficult topic

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
i i go to r slash eli 5 to get a quick

135
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
and easy explanation of what i'm working

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
on right for those of you who don't know

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
eli 5 is a subreddit called explain like

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
i'm 5

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
where

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
where you get people to explain

141
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,360
incredibly complex concepts to you in

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,759
fairly easy to understand ways and i

143
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,319
feel like schrodinger's cat is the same

144
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,960
idea when it comes to quantum computing

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
it's a thought experiment so don't worry

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
no animals were harmed in the making of

147
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
this presentation

148
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
to illustrate the idea of quantum

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
superposition there was a uh a physicist

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
uh you can see up here named erwin

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,039
schrodinger uh who actually had some of

152
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
these conversations with einstein and

153
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
other you know other physicists at the

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,120
time who he was working with

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
and he it's kind of strange the the

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
story is a little bit discombobulated

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
because schrodinger was actually on the

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
wrong side of this argument at first um

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,000
everyone kind of thinks of schrodinger's

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,919
cat as him sort of justifying

161
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,800
superposition he he actually was arguing

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
against it but that's neither here nor

163
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,919
there um

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,000
the illustration itself

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,039
um

166
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,720
was that schrodinger joked that if you

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
put a radioactive atom

168
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
inside of a windowless box

169
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
and then put a cat inside of it and left

170
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
it there for an hour without any way to

171
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
observe it

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
you wouldn't know whether the cat was

173
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
alive or dead

174
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
and because of this that meant that

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,000
until the box itself was actually opened

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
the cat is both alive and dead

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,680
you don't know whether the cat is 100

178
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,880
alive or 100 dead until you observe it

179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,039
after opening the box

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,319
right so that that's the idea of

181
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
schroedinger's cat and

182
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
the point of this analogy for

183
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
schrodinger was to describe what happens

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
when humans observe something like a

185
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
quantum particle

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
because of the steps that humans need to

187
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
go through in order to actually observe

188
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
the behavior of something as small as an

189
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
electron

190
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
our observation of the electron itself

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,479
would actually change its behavior

192
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
so just like the cat right it's the same

193
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
idea as schrodinger's cat

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
and until we open the box with the

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
electron inside we don't know where it

196
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
is

197
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,360
and and you can see here that uh that

198
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
that schrodinger's entire idea here

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
was to describe the idea of observation

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,879
um and it would and and how observation

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
can actually have an impact on the

202
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
experiment itself

203
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
and this this is actually an explanation

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
of the concept of superposition right um

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,759
and the idea of superposition is that

206
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
something can be

207
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,520
in in the example of schrodinger's cat

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,958
is that the cat is both alive and dead

209
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
until it is actually observed right so

210
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
you don't know

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
what state the cat is in until it is

212
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
actually observed and that actually

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,080
describes one of the principles of

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
quantum computing and quantum mechanics

215
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
that was kind of the the thought

216
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
experiment that schroedinger used in

217
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,320
order to explain this

218
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,920
so now that we understand the idea of

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
schrodinger's cut let's apply that to

220
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,560
the concept of quantum computing

221
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
so our next topic is quantum computing

222
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
what is it and how does it actually

223
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,240
function how does it work

224
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
well to really understand what quantum

225
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
computing is

226
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
let's think about actual classical

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
computing the computing that we all work

228
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
with on a daily basis and that we

229
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
understand

230
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
so a traditional computer right the ones

231
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
that we all have in our houses or

232
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
sometimes here even at the conference

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
a classical computer or traditional

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
computer will use

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
bits right we're all very familiar with

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
the idea of a bit it's either a zero or

237
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,480
a one

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
right and computers use zeros and ones

239
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,640
to perform calculations

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
well quantum computers are a little bit

241
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
different since they actually use a data

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,519
storage method called qubits instead of

243
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
these bits

244
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
now a cubit can represent the number

245
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
zero or one like a bit

246
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
but qubits can also be in what's called

247
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
quantum superposition which describes

248
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
their quantum state before they're

249
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,959
actually measured

250
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
so in this quantum superposition state a

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,920
cubit can be both a zero and a one

252
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
and the only way to find out whether

253
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
it's a zero or one is to actually

254
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
measure it but we can use that quantum

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
state in order to perform calculations

256
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
incredibly quickly and manipulation of

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
that superposition state allows

258
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
developers to create different

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
algorithms that are able to more quickly

260
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,839
and efficiently compute data than

261
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
traditional classical computers

262
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
so um quantum computing the term quantum

263
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
computing describes a computer that uses

264
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,399
quantum concepts like superposition and

265
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,720
entanglement to perform calculations

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
faster than traditional computers

267
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
a qubit can represent the number zero or

268
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,600
one right like like we were saying but

269
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,200
it can also be in that superposition

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,279
state it can be both a zero and a one

271
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
right now quantum computers aren't

272
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
actually general purpose programmable

273
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
computers right they're only designed to

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
solve specific problems so it's not like

275
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
it's not like quantum computers are

276
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
going to take over the role of classical

277
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
computers for most things at least until

278
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
we really reach true quantum supremacy

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
where quantum computers are always more

280
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
efficient than classical computers

281
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
we will still be using both classical

282
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,600
and quantum computers for different

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
purposes

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
so um quantum computers are better at

285
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
different problems like uh for instance

286
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
factorization which is a problem that's

287
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
oftentimes used in encryption one of the

288
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
things that uh you know this particular

289
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,200
conference might be a little bit

290
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,519
interested in right how can you break

291
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,560
some of the

292
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
most widely used encryption schemes in

293
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
the world today like rsa for example or

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,200
elliptic curve cryptography well quantum

295
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
is really the way you can do that by

296
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,079
attacking these problems like

297
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,839
factorization

298
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
um it can also attack something like the

299
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,639
traveling salesman problem which we we

300
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,000
currently work on with classical

301
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
computers but because of quantum

302
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
computing we can actually solve problems

303
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
like the traveling salesman problem

304
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
where you try to find the shortest

305
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,519
possible route across multiple cities or

306
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
you know multiple different areas

307
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
in some hypothetical problem in a much

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
more efficient and fast way than

309
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,279
classical computing

310
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,120
and quantum computers excel at solving

311
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
these kinds of problems because they're

312
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
able to use the superposition of qubits

313
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,920
to perform vast amounts of calculations

314
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
almost instantly

315
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
this is because they're able to form

316
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
calculations based on the probability of

317
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,920
an object's state before it's actually

318
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,279
measured

319
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
so think back to the schrodinger's cat

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
example i just told you about

321
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,079
remember that you don't know whether the

322
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
cat is alive or dead until you look in

323
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,600
the box

324
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,399
the way quantum computers actually work

325
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
involves performing calculations before

326
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
you look in the box and then opening the

327
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,920
box afterwards

328
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,279
let's talk a little bit more about how

329
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
quantum computers actually function so

330
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
ibm actually gives a great example of

331
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
this on their quantum computing site and

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
for this to make sense you might want to

333
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,399
think back to your high school biology

334
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
days so i apologize in advance that this

335
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,360
conjures up any bad memories

336
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
but

337
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
protein folding is one of the problems

338
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,760
that quantum can really take on and uh

339
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,000
a protein is basically just a long

340
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,880
string of amino acids

341
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
that after you fold them they become

342
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
complex shapes and they actually become

343
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
useful biological machines

344
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,639
so figuring out how proteins will fold

345
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
is important for biology and medicine

346
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
a classical supercomputer might try to

347
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,000
fold a protein with brute force and that

348
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
that's what we that's what we use it for

349
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
right now you may have heard of the at

350
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,959
home project

351
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
like seti at home where you can search

352
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
for extraterrestrial intelligence um

353
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,199
through uh through kind of grid

354
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
computing using the idea of multiple

355
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,480
computers working together as a

356
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
supercomputer

357
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,800
well

358
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,399
uh they also had a project called

359
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
folding at home which was designed to do

360
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
this with protein folding basically just

361
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,079
using a bunch of classical computers in

362
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,639
order to figure out um all the different

363
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,360
uh methods of bending this chemical

364
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
chain just through pure brute force

365
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
well

366
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,639
a much more efficient way of doing this

367
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
is to use a quantum computer because as

368
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
the protein sequences get longer and

369
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
more complex the supercomputer itself

370
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
actually stalls

371
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,360
so a chain of 100 amino acids could

372
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
theoretically fold in like trillions of

373
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
different ways right and brute forcing

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
that with classical computers is really

375
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
not very practical

376
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
no computer has the working memory to

377
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
actually be able to handle all the

378
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
possible combinations of those protein

379
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
folds

380
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
but when we think about quantum

381
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
computing it's it's a lot different

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
it's in the case of proteins there are

383
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
actually quantum algorithms today that

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
can find folding patterns in entirely

385
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
new and more efficient ways and that's

386
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,040
without going through all the brute

387
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
forcing that those classical computers

388
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
have to do

389
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
as quantum hardware continues to scale

390
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
and grow and these algorithms get more

391
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
and more advanced

392
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
they can also tackle protein folding

393
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
problems that are too complex for any

394
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
supercomputer today

395
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,240
so that's the idea kind of behind why we

396
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,480
would use quantum computing rather than

397
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
classical computing to handle some of

398
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
these very complex computational

399
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,600
problems

400
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,199
let's talk about how quantum computers

401
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
actually function too

402
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
you'll you'll use a quantum processing

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,279
unit or a qpu along with your cpu but in

404
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,880
order to do that in order to get a

405
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
functioning qpu there are a lot of

406
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
different methods that you have to use

407
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,120
in order to build a quantum computer

408
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
so let's talk about super fluids first

409
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
you probably have a fan or some kind of

410
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
internal cooling system on your pc at

411
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
home right

412
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
well quantum processors need to be

413
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
incredibly cold it's not just keeping

414
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
them at room temperature it's actually

415
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
keeping them at about 100 of a degree

416
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,680
above absolute zero

417
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,480
so

418
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,839
quantum computers have to be in

419
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,759
incredibly incredibly cold spaces and

420
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,639
manufacturers of quantum computers use

421
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
superfluids which are the these these

422
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
fluids that will actually

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
keep the quantum computers at this

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
degree above absolute zero in order to

425
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,079
create something called a superconductor

426
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
because of the incredibly low

427
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,079
temperature electrons can actually move

428
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
through quantum computers without any

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,519
resistance at all

430
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,399
so that makes them superconductors

431
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,839
and when electrons pass through

432
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
superconductors they match up and they

433
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,600
form something called a cooper pair

434
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
so a cooper pair can carry a charge

435
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
across insulators through a process

436
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
called quantum tunneling and i know this

437
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
is this is a little more advanced you

438
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
can you can read up on this uh online

439
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,279
unfortunately it's this this topic is so

440
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,880
complex that it's hard to sort of

441
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
encapsulate it all within a within a

442
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
15-minute talk but um the idea here is

443
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,319
basically that you're using these coupe

444
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
repairs to be able to carry that charge

445
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
across these insulators which kind of

446
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
act as barriers um and that that's the

447
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,880
process known as quantum tunneling so if

448
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
you put two superconductors on either

449
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
side of one of these insulators

450
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,760
they form something called a josephson

451
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
junction

452
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
now um

453
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
as we think about this these josephson

454
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
junctions are basically

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,280
used as the qubits as the

456
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
superconducting qubits right that's how

457
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
we get to a qubit something that can

458
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
store a zero a one or a zero and one at

459
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
the same time

460
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
and the way that the way that these can

461
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
actually be controlled these cubits can

462
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
be controlled is you fire

463
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
microwave photons at the qubits in order

464
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,039
to control their behavior so you can

465
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,480
actually get them to hold you can get

466
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,320
them to change and you can get them to

467
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
read out different parts of quantum

468
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,799
information by firing these microwave

469
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,600
photons at the qubits so it's it's

470
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
really crazy i mean it sounds like

471
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
sci-fi but people are doing it today

472
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
that brings us to another topic which is

473
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,480
entanglement you may have heard of

474
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
quantum entanglement before if you

475
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
haven't quantum

476
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
quantum entanglement is basically an

477
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
effect that

478
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
correlates the behavior of two separate

479
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
things so let's say that we have two

480
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,039
qubits that are entangled right maybe

481
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
one qubit is is in in a superposition

482
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
state and another qubit is also in a

483
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,039
superposition state but a change to one

484
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,720
of those qubits in will actually impact

485
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
the other qubit

486
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
right and so the way that quantum

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
algorithms work is they actually

488
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,720
leverage those relationships to find

489
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,760
solutions to different complex problems

490
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
um and uh we'll talk about one of those

491
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
algorithms uh in just a moment and and

492
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
how that operates and again the source

493
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
for this is from the ibm quantum

494
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,720
computing site

495
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,679
at ibm.com topics quantum computing

496
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
so

497
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
let's next talk about what quantum

498
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,840
computing is used for and how you can

499
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
actually use it

500
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
so you can see up here we have an actual

501
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
ibm quantum computer and i really wanted

502
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,679
to show the pictures of these quantum

503
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,200
computers because

504
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
for some reason and i don't know exactly

505
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
why this was i i always thought these

506
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
things were very theoretical right i

507
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,799
didn't think that they were something

508
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,960
you could use today but they are

509
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
and you know you obviously you know this

510
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,679
thing probably costs about 15 million

511
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,760
dollars right so none of us have the

512
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,480
money to do that but i'll show you how

513
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
you can actually interact with these

514
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,799
quantum computers in just a minute

515
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,280
think about almost any computational

516
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
process today

517
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,320
and

518
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,960
eventually with the advancement of

519
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
different quantum properties at some

520
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,720
point quantum computing will probably be

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,160
able to handle a lot of these different

522
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,679
use cases

523
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
so infosec is one of the most

524
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
interesting things for uh for us to

525
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,400
think about right at a hacker conference

526
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,159
and i've already mentioned sort of the

527
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,880
method of of breaking asymmetric

528
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
algorithms like rsa or elliptic

529
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
elliptic curve cryptography

530
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
but there are a lot of other really

531
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
fascinating ways of making new

532
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
algorithms that are also quantum

533
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
resistant so you can make an algorithm

534
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,679
so strong that even a quantum computer

535
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
can't break it and we'll talk a little

536
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,039
bit about that in a minute but there are

537
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,200
another another a number of other really

538
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
interesting use cases as well

539
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
so there are quantum algorithms for

540
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,600
things like financial modeling which are

541
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,799
you know which are going to be really

542
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,880
useful for banks and other financial

543
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,559
institutions

544
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,720
data sorting which is a great use case

545
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,000
especially if you're working with big

546
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
data and you're trying to figure out a

547
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,039
way to optimally sort that data quantum

548
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,960
computing is one method

549
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
of doing that really efficiently

550
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
another another really interesting use

551
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
case is

552
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
you know

553
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
on the science level chemical and

554
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,039
physics problems

555
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,280
can be solved with quantum computing

556
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
so the problem is you know i i mentioned

557
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,679
these quantum computers are like 15

558
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,120
million dollars

559
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,799
anyone here have 50 million dollars to

560
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,760
drop on a quantum computer today

561
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
if you do talk to me after we'll we'll

562
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
have we'll have a good talk um if you

563
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,960
don't

564
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,200
the good news is that you don't need to

565
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
anymore right we're in the era of the

566
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
cloud where you can actually use quantum

567
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,039
computers today

568
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,000
without having to buy one right you can

569
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,159
rent time on one of these quantum

570
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,400
computers in fact aws microsoft azure

571
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,600
ibm cloud all have great methods of

572
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
being able to interact with quantum

573
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
computers today

574
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
so let's talk a little bit more about

575
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
quantum computing and some of the cool

576
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
things we can do with quantum

577
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
all right as you can see here

578
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
this is so real that even boring

579
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
business people care now

580
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
right uh you guys heard of gartner

581
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
gartner is like a boring consulting

582
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
company for rich people right but

583
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
um but gartner has said as you can see

584
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,559
up here that they estimate that less

585
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,919
than one percent of companies are

586
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
budgeting for quantum today

587
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
by next year they estimate 20 percent of

588
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
organizations will be budgeting for

589
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
quantum computing projects

590
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
so from less than one percent to 20

591
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
in like a year

592
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
um and i i've seen this myself in the

593
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
business world i've talked to multiple

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
companies that are hiring for quantum

595
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
developers that are looking for people

596
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
in this space right now so uh i i think

597
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
gartner's estimate might be a little bit

598
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
on the high side i'm not sure 20 of

599
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
organizations but i think if you look at

600
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,039
really large institutions especially

601
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,320
banks especially um you know other other

602
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
institutions that have the funding for

603
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,679
this kind of thing

604
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,120
i think it's it's fairly realistic i

605
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
would have to make closer to 10 or 15

606
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
but um that's that's kind of that's kind

607
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
of what i'm looking at right now you can

608
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
see here also uh there are a lot of

609
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,400
different kinds of use cases that we can

610
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
think of for quantum and we'll go over

611
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,320
these in a little more detail but you

612
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,760
know things like machine learning

613
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
chemistry physics being able to solve

614
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
manufacturing and logistics problems

615
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
there are all kinds of different uh

616
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
methods that we can use quantum four uh

617
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
and and you can see here in this uh in

618
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
this graph um pretty much pick your

619
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,559
poison right uh i mentioned protein

620
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,960
folding already but even use cases like

621
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,039
autonomous vehicles um you know being

622
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,000
able to

623
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
have uh you being able to take your uber

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,799
without an uber driver uh being able to

625
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,679
uh

626
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,000
use these things to come up with

627
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,120
new use cases for pharmaceuticals there

628
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
are a virtually infinite number of use

629
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,440
cases when it comes to

630
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
what we can use quantum for and they're

631
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,039
still figuring out use cases today so

632
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,559
even though quantum is being used for

633
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
these very specialized situations at the

634
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
moment there are a lot of other

635
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
possibilities in the future particularly

636
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
as we move closer to true quantum

637
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,279
supremacy which i don't really think

638
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,440
we've reached yet google and ibm have

639
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,120
both come out and said oh yeah we're at

640
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,799
the quantum supremacy

641
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,720
place and then each one of them have

642
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
sort of have sort of debunked the others

643
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
claims so i'm not really sure we're

644
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
quite there yet but i think we will be

645
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
someday

646
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
so let's talk a little bit about uh

647
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,600
cryptography where we are at a hacker

648
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
conference after all let's talk about

649
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
hacking quantum or what quantum can

650
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,679
actually do to hack

651
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
you can see here peter shore one of the

652
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
most brilliant computer scientists and

653
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
mathematicians in the world

654
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
and he came up with

655
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,520
this incredible algorithm called shore's

656
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,960
algorithm

657
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
you can see here uh shore's algorithm is

658
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
a polynomial time quantum algorithm for

659
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,880
the factoring problem classical

660
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
computers have not been able to develop

661
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
any kind of polynomial

662
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,679
solution to the factoring problem but

663
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
peter sure proved which you can actually

664
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
see on the graph on the right hand side

665
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
of the screen here

666
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
how much more efficient quantum

667
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
computing can be

668
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,039
to to actually go through the factoring

669
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
algorithm so that so if you're not

670
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
familiar with the factoring problem

671
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
the factoring problem is one way to make

672
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,799
it difficult for classical computers to

673
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,840
find prime factors of very large numbers

674
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
when cryptographers were trying to

675
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,279
figure out what crypt what what

676
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,039
cryptographic algorithms can we actually

677
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
use to protect data

678
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,159
they had to figure out something that

679
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
was really difficult which is

680
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,720
what kind of problem is going to be hard

681
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
for a computer to solve

682
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
and the problem they came up with was

683
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,559
the factoring problem

684
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,000
and that's basically

685
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,120
figuring out

686
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,279
the prime factors of very large numbers

687
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,840
so if i gave you a you know a number

688
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,640
like

689
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
you know 10 trillion

690
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,360
500 mil your 500 billion 300 million

691
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
blah blah blah whatever right trying to

692
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,080
figure out what the prime factors are

693
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,320
that come up with that number is very

694
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
difficult for classical computers to do

695
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
and that's one of the ways that

696
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
especially our asymmetric encryption

697
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,080
functions today rsa uses this factoring

698
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,720
problem as a way of making traditional

699
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
computers too slow at being able to

700
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
solve this kind of problem to make it

701
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,679
efficient enough to actually break the

702
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,360
cryptography

703
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
well shore's algorithm was brilliant

704
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,919
because it uses this extremely efficient

705
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
method of quantum fourier transformation

706
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,240
and modular exponentiation by repeated

707
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
squarings of these different numbers to

708
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
vastly speed up this process

709
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
basically he makes the computer go

710
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
really fast right

711
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,159
it's it's uh it's it's really

712
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,200
interesting when you actually take a

713
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,159
look at

714
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
sort of the uh

715
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,960
the

716
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,919
um the efficiency of a classical

717
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,840
algorithm which is that uh

718
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
that arc in red

719
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,679
versus the blue

720
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,760
here on the screen you can see that and

721
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,640
and then the number of digits here is d

722
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
right you can see the classical record

723
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
in terms of number of operations here is

724
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
230 digits whereas if you were to use

725
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,720
shore's algorithm on a computer with

726
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
with qubits that go beyond the number of

727
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
qubits that we have on quantum computers

728
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,919
today we could be able to very easily

729
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,399
break these algorithms now

730
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,039
because of hardware constraints because

731
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
quantum computing is developing rapidly

732
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
but not quite where it will be

733
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
eventually

734
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,520
shore's algorithm has not yet broken

735
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
these uh these encryption algorithms

736
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
right so you can still use rsa today

737
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
the question is

738
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,799
what do we do when our crypto is broken

739
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,919
right

740
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,039
today's crypto is going to be pwned at

741
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,480
some point

742
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
you can see here

743
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
that especially when we're talking about

744
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,880
asymmetric crypto um symmetric krypto is

745
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,440
probably going to withstand quantum for

746
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
the most part but asymmetric crypto

747
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
because of some of the techniques that

748
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,039
we use is probably most at danger here

749
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,360
you can see because of shore's algorithm

750
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,799
these quantum machines will be able to

751
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,200
break algorithms like rsa and ecc

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
actually it's really interesting because

753
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840
very recently i was i was going through

754
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
the outline for my presentation as i was

755
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,559
creating it and i i clicked on my my

756
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,399
link to nist and i saw it was a dead

757
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,799
link and that's because nist has

758
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
actually changed

759
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
the the algorithms they've already

760
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,799
chosen for this project

761
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,880
even since the time that i originally

762
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
created the outline for my presentation

763
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,919
so

764
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,200
as of uh july 2nd just uh three weeks

765
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
ago

766
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,039
uh nist has actually chosen

767
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,919
algorithms that are quantum resistant

768
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,039
that means they're going to be very

769
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,880
difficult for even quantum computers to

770
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,399
be able to break

771
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
so you guys remember when uh you guys

772
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
remember when des was broken by the eff

773
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,559
like back in the late 90s

774
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,799
if you if you don't des was the old

775
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,559
standard for encryption that the us

776
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,320
government used to use a lot of

777
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
conspiracy-minded people or even people

778
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
who aren't so conspiracy minded think

779
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
that nsa probably put an intentional bug

780
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
into des to make it easier for them to

781
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
decrypt because it was only a 56-bit

782
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,399
crypto system

783
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,039
so uh they came up with aes which is

784
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,039
what we're all using right now to stay

785
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
connected to the wi-fi right aes

786
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,399
encryption is now the government

787
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
standard and they went through a very

788
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,200
careful selection process for this um in

789
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
i believe the early 2000s where they

790
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,720
they took a bunch of different

791
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
candidates one was uh reindoll which is

792
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
the actual candidate that was chosen for

793
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
aes

794
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,440
another one was i believe bruce

795
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,240
schneier's blowfish algorithm uh was

796
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,399
another uh so

797
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,520
this this process is what nist does to

798
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,840
basically come up with the most secure

799
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
encryption algorithms going forward and

800
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,520
for

801
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,399
these uh quantum resistant algorithms

802
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
they have chosen the crystals kyber

803
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
algorithm as the new quantum resistant

804
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,640
algorithm that means even when we have

805
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,799
quantum computers we'll still be able to

806
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,799
encrypt our data with something that is

807
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,399
quantum safe

808
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,000
now they also have a number of digital

809
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
signature related algorithms um

810
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
the crystals dilithium algorithm is

811
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,039
actually related to crystals kyber um

812
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,159
same i believe it's the same developers

813
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,559
but they use some of the same concepts

814
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,440
falcon and sphinx are also being used as

815
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
the new digital signature quantum

816
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,600
resistant algorithms

817
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,760
and nist has gone through this very

818
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,399
elaborate process to figure out what the

819
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,120
best methods of protecting our data will

820
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,840
be in a post-quantum world

821
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
now

822
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
there are a few other candidates that

823
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,559
are currently going through round four

824
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,919
of the process

825
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
and you can read more on the nist site

826
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,720
about this i'll have some links in the

827
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
presentation but uh

828
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
it's good to know that the crypto that

829
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,640
we're using for the future will

830
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
eventually be quantum resistant

831
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,159
that said

832
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
the current

833
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,519
encryption algorithms we use are not

834
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,120
quantum resistant so they're going to

835
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,320
have problems in the future

836
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,120
now let's take a look at

837
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,840
what problems that might actually cause

838
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,200
you can see here um well let's see i i

839
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
believe oh you know what i'm sorry it

840
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
was on my previous slide sorry about

841
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
that uh on the uh on the right hand side

842
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
of the screen here you can see the uh

843
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,760
the github for kyber which is the

844
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,000
general use post quantum encryption

845
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
algorithm that nist has standardized on

846
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
you also see on the far right side of

847
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
the screen here

848
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,679
the nsa utah data center

849
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,640
i'm not sure if any of you guys have

850
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
heard about this but

851
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
the the nsa has built an enormous data

852
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,960
center in utah that is uh storing

853
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,799
incredible amounts of data about uh

854
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,039
both americans and foreign nationals

855
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,320
right so

856
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
uh at some point

857
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
if you think about it

858
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,039
people who think they are sending secure

859
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,159
data

860
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,159
are having that secure data captured

861
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,640
that maybe can't be decrypted today

862
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
but as soon as nsa gets their hands on

863
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,080
one of these quantum computers that's

864
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
actually able to decrypt something like

865
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
rsa or ecc

866
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,120
all of a sudden they'll have the keys to

867
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,039
the kingdom right and data that they've

868
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
been collecting over years will be able

869
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,600
to be compromised so

870
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,519
that's the reason why it's so important

871
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,600
to develop these post-quantum algorithms

872
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,480
so that even if someone like nsa is able

873
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,519
to break

874
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,919
uh crypto that we can still have a

875
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,240
method of securing our data the great

876
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
part about these algorithms is that they

877
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,159
are all open source and open to the

878
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,120
public

879
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,799
thankfully they aren't classified like

880
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,880
the old skipjack algorithm or something

881
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
like that was so you can actually go

882
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,159
through the code look at how it's

883
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,360
functioning and you can actually see

884
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
weaknesses in the code um which is which

885
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
is a really important part of this so i

886
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,799
think i think it's it's important to

887
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,720
know how your data is being secured so

888
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
that you can be confident that even far

889
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,240
into the future that you will be able to

890
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,039
secure your data

891
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,640
now let's talk a little bit about what

892
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
else quantum can do

893
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,880
so there are a number of other different

894
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,559
use cases that we can we can kind of

895
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,120
focus on when it comes to quantum

896
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,840
and a couple of those use cases

897
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
include artificial intelligence and

898
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,519
machine learning right there's actually

899
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,679
a field called qml or quantum machine

900
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,440
learning right now that is already

901
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
really focused on this problem and when

902
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
you start to see things like gpt3 or

903
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,320
dahle you can see how important ai and

904
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,279
ml are going to be going forward

905
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,720
i already mentioned chemistry and

906
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
physics is two of the the different use

907
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,840
cases here

908
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,200
um

909
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
said being able to study chemical

910
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,240
reactions through quantum will be a huge

911
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
huge advantage for scientists

912
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,000
as well as physics right you can you can

913
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
actually um you know especially when it

914
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,360
comes to simulating quantum systems um

915
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,960
being able to use quantum computers to

916
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,399
do that will be an invaluable resource

917
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,919
even things like weather forecasting i

918
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,880
know there are probably some weather

919
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,640
nerds in here

920
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
the hacker crowd tends to kind of bring

921
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,119
them out but being able to predict what

922
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,560
weather will look like in the future

923
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
based on being able to compute these

924
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,239
incredibly large

925
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
data sources

926
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
we also have a couple of other a couple

927
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,359
of other use cases i already mentioned

928
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
finance right and how finance may uh may

929
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,918
work with some of these things even but

930
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,199
you know if you want to look at the

931
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,399
blockchain right there are probably a

932
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,839
lot of people here who are interested in

933
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,320
that now the blockchain uses uh you know

934
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,000
symmetric cryptography but there are

935
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,760
some blockchain implementations that use

936
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,599
asymmetric cryptography

937
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,000
if we have a quantum system

938
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and the blockchain is not using quantum

939
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
safe cryptography there's a possibility

940
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,239
that you can actually break some of this

941
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,199
cryptography with quantum computers

942
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,918
finally the logistics

943
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
problem which i i believe is going to be

944
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
a really great use case i kind of talked

945
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
about the traveling salesman problem

946
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
already but being able to find the most

947
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
efficient way for goods and services to

948
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,119
be delivered is going to be another

949
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
really great use case for quantum

950
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,760
computing

951
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,599
so the question comes well all this

952
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,320
seems cool but like who cares right only

953
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,920
only rich people can get to use these

954
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,760
quantum computers right now

955
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,839
i don't have one i don't have access to

956
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,079
one you know this stuff seems kind of

957
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,440
cool but like

958
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,520
what's in it for me right

959
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,440
well let me tell you

960
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
there are a lot of really great ways

961
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,359
that you can actually interact with

962
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,880
quantum today

963
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
you can see on the right hand side of

964
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,079
the screen i have i put a prompt into

965
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,920
this cool little ai app it's kind of

966
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,079
similar to something like dolly uh but

967
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,200
it's called uh wombo dream so i typed in

968
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
cyberpunk hacker pwning a quantum

969
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,160
computer

970
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,520
and that's uh that's what it came up

971
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
with on the right

972
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,119
so that could be you today

973
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
a couple of really cool links and i put

974
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,640
these in the presentation i'll give a

975
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,720
link to the presentation here at the end

976
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,040
but you can see here github has one of

977
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,640
their awesome lists i don't know if

978
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
you've ever seen a github awesome list

979
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,520
but it basically leaves like the best

980
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,160
resources for dealing with any problem

981
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,560
and the awesome list is really great for

982
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,040
quantum there are all kinds of really

983
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,280
really cool tools that are mostly free

984
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,560
and open source you can access there

985
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,400
ibm has created this sdk called kiss kit

986
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,240
totally open source

987
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
there are some amazing amazing uh

988
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,119
aspects of it i i would like to show you

989
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,160
if we have a little bit of time at the

990
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,599
end i might even get a chance to show

991
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,599
you kind of a basic kiss kit use case

992
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,359
here but uh

993
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,440
a couple of other uh a couple of other

994
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
really great uh projects that you should

995
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
check out one is uh the quantum open

996
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,079
source foundation they have tons of

997
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,599
different dev tools if you're interested

998
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
in getting into this um and these are

999
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,200
all tools you can use for free right uh

1000
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
the really great part about this

1001
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
community is they've open sourced and

1002
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,520
made

1003
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
really free software out of a lot of

1004
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,839
their tools so you don't have to pay

1005
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,000
anything to get involved

1006
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,839
microsoft has created q sharp in the

1007
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,800
quantum development kit or their qdk

1008
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,400
they have an entire language they've

1009
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
that they've created very similar to

1010
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
something like ibm's kiss kit where you

1011
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
can use the existing programming

1012
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
knowledge you have like kisskit is

1013
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,599
essentially python right but you can

1014
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,680
import these quantum modules that you

1015
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
can actually use to interact with

1016
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
quantum computers

1017
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,640
and

1018
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
microsoft is also working on a lot of

1019
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
different cool uh methods of

1020
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,560
establishing

1021
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,359
quantum safe algorithms today so i've

1022
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
been playing around a little bit with um

1023
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
their their implementation of openvpn

1024
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
but they implement it in a

1025
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,640
way that is safe from quantum so

1026
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
even even if you do have a quantum

1027
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
computer that can they can attack

1028
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
existing algorithms

1029
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,839
um they have a vpn

1030
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,760
a quantum safe vpn system that they're

1031
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,200
building as well as a quantum safe tls

1032
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,680
system for uh for certificates so some

1033
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,720
some very cool stuff there

1034
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,839
but you know those are just some tools

1035
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
with kind of working on how to develop

1036
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,280
for quantum computers

1037
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
how can i actually get my hands on a

1038
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
quantum computer today

1039
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,880
again a lot of really good uh ways of

1040
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,160
using current cloud computing providers

1041
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
resources in order to access quantum

1042
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,839
computing i use the analogy of this

1043
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,920
being kind of like having access to a

1044
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
pdp-11 in the 70s right that's what

1045
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,560
that's what bill gates and paul allen

1046
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,920
did right they were able to get

1047
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,520
timeshare access

1048
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,359
on one of these enormous machines that

1049
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,359
took up a whole room it's not like it's

1050
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,560
not like gates and allen could have

1051
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
actually bought one of those computers

1052
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,520
no instead they bought timeshare rights

1053
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,359
on them and

1054
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,280
current quantum computers are much like

1055
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,800
that right we have the same idea here so

1056
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
you are essentially getting timeshare

1057
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,640
access to the next wave

1058
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
and you can do that through systems you

1059
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,240
are probably already really familiar

1060
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
with how many of us have worked with aws

1061
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,560
or azure in the past

1062
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,960
yeah i see tons of hands going up right

1063
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,359
these are very familiar systems and you

1064
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,640
can use

1065
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,359
tools in aws and azure today in order to

1066
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,000
access real quantum computers it's super

1067
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,800
cool

1068
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
so aws has uh their bracket system you

1069
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
can use to access uh really really uh

1070
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
incredibly fast quantum computers

1071
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
sometimes you have to wait for a few

1072
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,599
hours or whatever to get the quantum

1073
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,920
computer to do its to do the job for you

1074
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,839
i actually wanted to do a live demo but

1075
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,599
unfortunately just because of the amount

1076
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,040
of time that we had

1077
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
a lot of the times those quantum

1078
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,240
computers aren't available for a few

1079
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
hours or something it's kind of like

1080
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,839
when you were working on a pdp-11 you

1081
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,839
had to wait your turn for the computer

1082
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,200
to actually do what you wanted to do but

1083
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,640
you you can

1084
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,240
put yourself in the queue and after a

1085
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,920
few hours have

1086
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,560
your quantum code run by a real quantum

1087
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
computer and a lot of the time like in

1088
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
aws bracket or something it costs like

1089
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,400
30 cents per job or something and just

1090
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
like regular aws boxes you don't want to

1091
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,119
leave that box just running indefinitely

1092
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,960
because then the you know the the

1093
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,520
charges start to build up but if you

1094
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,920
want to run single jobs with quantum you

1095
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
can actually do that right now or

1096
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
alternatively if you want to if you want

1097
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,520
to keep it free you can run them in a

1098
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,680
quantum simulator right and be able to

1099
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,839
figure out how it would operate on a

1100
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,680
real quantum computer but you don't have

1101
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
to use a quantum simulator today you can

1102
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,200
actually use a real quantum computer to

1103
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,480
do this

1104
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,920
we've got some other systems up here

1105
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,880
azure quantum like i mentioned the ibm q

1106
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,440
experience ibm is really uh really

1107
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
digging their heels in when it comes to

1108
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
uh being able to

1109
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
uh create some pretty impressive quantum

1110
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
systems they're they're doing they're

1111
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000
going about this in the right way kiss

1112
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
kit is a great system to be able to

1113
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
develop in

1114
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,680
google's quantum ai super cool stuff

1115
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,280
tensorflow if any of you have worked

1116
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,760
with that before is kind of key to that

1117
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,359
google ai

1118
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,960
so definitely recommend checking that

1119
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,280
out and then ion q who are one of the

1120
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,440
main computer manufacturers working in

1121
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,640
the quantum space right now

1122
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,240
let's talk a little bit more about just

1123
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
how to get involved in the quantum

1124
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,440
community because this stuff is hard

1125
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,560
it's really complicated like i i have no

1126
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,599
idea how 99.9 of it works to be honest

1127
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,440
the main point of this presentation is

1128
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,599
to get you involved because i know there

1129
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,359
are people who are way smarter than me

1130
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,839
at this conference and i think that the

1131
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,599
more we focus on this stuff as a

1132
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,480
community

1133
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,319
the deeper into quantum we can get and

1134
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,400
the cooler that we can make

1135
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,200
so

1136
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,800
um a couple of a couple of really good

1137
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,319
places to check out you want to check

1138
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,240
out unitary fund they're they're this

1139
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,599
non-profit that's been put together by a

1140
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,560
bunch of companies to help spread the

1141
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,640
message of quantum and to really try to

1142
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,319
democratize quantum and get this to as

1143
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,800
many people as we can

1144
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,079
they have a website which is just

1145
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,319
unitary.fund and then their discord is

1146
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,319
discord.unitary.fund

1147
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,440
dot info is another great place if you

1148
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,119
want to go to conferences kind of like

1149
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,560
hope but that are that are really

1150
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,400
revolving around quantum in this new

1151
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,359
space check out quantum dot info

1152
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,079
quantum palooza is another list of free

1153
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,920
quantum training and conferences another

1154
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,200
really good resource if you're trying to

1155
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
get involved with the community if you

1156
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
want to learn more about this stuff from

1157
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
way smarter people than me great place

1158
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,680
to go

1159
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,200
and finally the quantum computing

1160
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,960
subreddit really good place for

1161
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,720
information and kind of just talk to

1162
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,400
people a little more casually there it's

1163
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,160
just r quantum computing

1164
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,920
and uh

1165
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
honestly that's pretty much it

1166
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
um if you want to

1167
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,800
troll me you can

1168
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,960
hit me up on any of these different

1169
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,079
services

1170
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,040
um there's also a a uh

1171
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,839
a copy of the presentation slides i

1172
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,839
promise it is malware free it will

1173
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,000
reflect on me very badly if it weren't

1174
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,160
but it's just tinyurl.com

1175
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
quantum computing hope um so you can go

1176
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,520
to that if you're interested in getting

1177
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
these slides um and seeing some more of

1178
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
the links the final uh the final page of

1179
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
the presentation is just a whole bunch

1180
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,079
of links i was hoping to get to show you

1181
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,359
guys some of this stuff but i'm too

1182
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,640
long-winded and ran out of time so um i

1183
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,040
want to uh i want to open it up to any

1184
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,359
questions uh thank you guys so much for

1185
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,560
for listening to the talk i really

1186
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,040
appreciate it

1187
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,560
thanks guys

1188
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,160
yeah any uh any questions or thoughts

1189
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
about this stuff and i may or may not be

1190
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,599
able to answer these questions just so

1191
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,000
you know like i said i am not an expert

1192
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,079
in this stuff so i may have to refer you

1193
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,319
to someone else or somewhere else but

1194
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,920
glad to glad to take any questions if

1195
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,560
anyone has any

1196
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,400
i can definitely i was actually going to

1197
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,200
do that on the kiss kit side

1198
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
absolutely

1199
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,960
if anyone have questions i have a

1200
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
microphone so just raise your hand

1201
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,800
give me one second here

1202
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
all right let's see uh can i get the uh

1203
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,520
can i get the screen back up please

1204
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,839
thank you

1205
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,040
whoops hold on

1206
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,280
awesome thanks very much you're doing a

1207
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,720
great job on that on the screen thank

1208
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,839
you it's been killer

1209
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,280
all right

1210
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,440
so here's here's a quick intro to kiskit

1211
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
which is the uh

1212
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
which is the sdk that ibm has created

1213
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,520
for quantum computing and you can see

1214
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,000
here this is kind of an intro for uh for

1215
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
the way that the the user workflow

1216
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,920
operates

1217
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,200
let me scroll down a little bit so you

1218
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,760
can actually see the code here

1219
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
and there are links to all these things

1220
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,800
within the presentation again that's

1221
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,000
just.tinyurl.com quantum computing hope

1222
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
you can see here this is all this is all

1223
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,599
python code right and that's like the

1224
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,319
coolest part is is you can use you can

1225
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,000
stand on the shoulder shoulders of

1226
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,400
giants and you can use the

1227
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,480
uh the knowledge that you already have

1228
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
about how to hack python in order to do

1229
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,440
this stuff so this is this is an example

1230
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,839
of uh the different workflow uh this is

1231
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,599
sort of the whole example so let me let

1232
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,440
me scroll down a little bit

1233
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
you can import the different packages

1234
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,359
that are needed for your app so you can

1235
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,160
uh

1236
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,720
you can just do standard standard python

1237
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
importing here um but you're also going

1238
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,599
to be importing uh quantum circuit

1239
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,839
chasm simulator and uh being able to

1240
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,839
plot the histogram of the actual quantum

1241
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,560
circuits that you're simulating

1242
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
then you will initialize variables right

1243
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,960
so you can create a quantum circuit

1244
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,400
here all you have to do is type in

1245
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,920
circuit equals quantum circuit

1246
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,040
parenthesis two comma two and

1247
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,680
parenthesis and you can initialize two

1248
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,920
qubits in the zero state

1249
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,520
right with with two of the classical

1250
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,079
bits set to zero really really cool

1251
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,319
stuff um i know i'm kind of i'm running

1252
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,440
out of time a little bit i just want to

1253
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,200
show you a couple more quick things you

1254
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,560
can add different gates actually

1255
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,160
manipulate registers of the circuit so

1256
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,920
this is where you can actually interact

1257
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,599
with the circuit itself

1258
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,000
is by is by using these different

1259
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
operations to to

1260
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,599
create um to create hadamard gates right

1261
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,839
which is one of the ways that quantum

1262
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,839
computing actually functions

1263
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,119
and then you can even visualize the

1264
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,400
circuit and get kind of a physical

1265
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,480
representation of or i should say a

1266
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,200
logical representation of what the what

1267
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,000
the circuit looks like

1268
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,359
finally you can actually perform a

1269
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,359
simulation of the experiment or you can

1270
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,920
actually run this live code on real

1271
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,640
quantum computers uh now there is a very

1272
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,319
small cost associated with that most of

1273
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,160
the time depending on what system you're

1274
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,520
using if you're using something like

1275
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,640
bracket there is you know there is a fee

1276
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,560
of like i said i think it's like

1277
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,920
30 50 cents something like that but uh

1278
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,520
that that's that's kind of the idea

1279
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,599
behind how this stuff actually works in

1280
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,720
the cloud

1281
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,880
um you can and then you can actually

1282
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,040
perform a visualization of the results

1283
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,240
so you can see here you actually get a

1284
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,760
histogram of uh the probabilities here

1285
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,800
um based on based on the uh the the

1286
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,880
different uh the different counts

1287
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
so that that's a quick uh quick little

1288
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,280
tutorial of how some of the code works i

1289
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
promise if you go online and look at it

1290
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,480
you'll get a much more in-depth

1291
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,559
explanation than i can offer here but

1292
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
totally worth checking out the resources

1293
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,720
um i can uh i can go ahead and throw

1294
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,920
the uh throw the presentation thing back

1295
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,599
on the screen hold on one sec

1296
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,319
one second here guys sorry there we go

1297
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,200
uh

1298
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,319
so this is

1299
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,079
the link to

1300
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,640
all the uh all the different resources

1301
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,598
that i was mentioning here

1302
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,200
just go to tinyurl.com quantum computing

1303
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,960
hope you'll have links to all those

1304
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,480
different resources

1305
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
um links to

1306
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,280
the ibm site the aws site azure and all

1307
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,319
the other quantum community resources so

1308
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,839
what i would advise you to is get

1309
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,599
involved in this stuff it's super cool

1310
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,000
you can hack it today this is not just

1311
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,839
sci-fi anymore it's not just something

1312
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,520
that's going to happen in the future you

1313
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,200
can work with quantum computers today

1314
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,720
and that's the point of my talk so

1315
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,240
thanks a lot guys i really appreciate it
