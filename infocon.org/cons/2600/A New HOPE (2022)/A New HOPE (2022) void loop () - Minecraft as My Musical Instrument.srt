anyway uh thanks so much uh my name is

61
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,440
ramon i'm here to talk about minecraft

62
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,400
and uh how i've been using it as a uh as

63
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
a musical instrument uh or

64
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
at least a vehicle

65
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,520
to create music uh in real time

66
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
let me

67
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
organize myself just a little bit

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
i've got a uh a really

69
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
quick rapid fire uh slideshow here for

70
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
you but it's more just because i have

71
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,280
some information some background

72
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
information uh to get out of uh out into

73
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,039
the world

74
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
um

75
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
i'm gonna disconnect here so it stops

76
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
making sound

77
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,958
so

78
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,320
this is not really the heart of it i

79
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
want to get back into minecraft and and

80
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
show you some actual things in the game

81
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
uh some developments that we've had uh

82
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
over the course of the last year and a

83
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
half uh but if anyone's interested in

84
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
some of the links you can scan that code

85
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
and get to this exact presentation

86
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
um

87
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
so i i'm an associate teaching professor

88
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
of music at umass lowell

89
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
and i've been there since 2012 i was

90
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
originally hired to shake up the music

91
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
theory program basically

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
burn it to the ground and build it back

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
up with a more global perspective

94
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
kind of all-inclusive

95
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
we basically

96
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
started from scratch we tried to make it

97
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,160
as non non-eurocentric as possible

98
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,959
and my role at umass lowell has

99
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,040
morphed over the years

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
in the last

101
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
i i guess for the last several semesters

102
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
i've taught mostly music technology

103
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
courses

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
i've always done music technology so

105
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
it's not a new thing but that's most of

106
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
what i've been teaching

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
i've started to teach music and sound

108
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
for games and then in the fall we're

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
launching the video game ensemble and so

110
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
a lot of these developments were born

111
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
out of kovid in fact and so what i

112
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
wanted to do is

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
talk about how i got here

114
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
how this happened in the first place and

115
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
so on march 11 2020 like so many other

116
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
places

117
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,320
so many other people i got an email that

118
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,399
said we were going full remote and

119
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
everyone was devastated i don't really

120
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
want to talk about that but but this is

121
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
what happened

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
and uh we decided they said they were

123
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
going to assess the situation of course

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
everybody

125
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
went full remote for a

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
very long time

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,959
through the entire next school year

128
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
so

129
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,959
the classes did not return to normal on

130
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
the date that they thought maybe they

131
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
would so

132
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
that that's what happened um

133
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,800
the the semester ended and we're not

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
going to speak about that at all it was

135
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
i know

136
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
we don't need to talk about it

137
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
but over the course of the summer ice

138
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
they told us we were going to go full

139
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
remote they decided this kind of early

140
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
so we had time to prepare for it and so

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
i made two big decisions about the

142
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
following year i decided one i was going

143
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
to perform a live concert on twitch for

144
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
the students in a thing that we have

145
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
called recital hour

146
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
most of the concerts were planned on

147
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,360
zoom and they were pre-recorded videos

148
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
and things like that or pre-recorded

149
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,440
audio i wanted to do something in real

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
time

151
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
so that was my that was my first

152
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
decision second i direct an ensemble

153
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
that's called the contemporary

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
electronic ensemble

155
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
and it's

156
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,720
full of experimentalists we

157
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,760
build hardware we use software some

158
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,600
people are doing kind of

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,279
out of the box

160
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,160
midi controllerism type of things but

161
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
it's

162
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
it covers a huge range of things so i

163
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,600
decided i'm also going to require my

164
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
students in that class

165
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
to do a live performance on twitch as

166
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
well real time

167
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,000
actually happening in the moment

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
engaging with the audience via chat

169
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
just so that we could have a new

170
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
experience out of this so those are my

171
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,120
two decisions um so the first one i was

172
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,399
going to perform on twitch for the

173
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
recital hour um

174
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
there were three problems i'm sure there

175
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,000
were more problems than this but three

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
big problems one i knew nothing of live

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,839
streaming i knew what it was but i

178
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
didn't know anything about how to do it

179
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
two i had minimal streaming equipment

180
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
you know i had a

181
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
i had a laptop i had a webcam things

182
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
like that but i didn't really have

183
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
streaming equipment anything um

184
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
that you see in these kind of full-time

185
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
twitch music streams

186
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
i'm a maximalist i like to use a lot of

187
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,399
equipment on stage and so i wanted to

188
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,360
see

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
how i could

190
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
put together a small streaming rig

191
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
just

192
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
to have more to work with

193
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
three

194
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
i wanted to have some kind of

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
collaboration between at least one of my

196
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,399
students and myself during the concert

197
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
this was the hardest one of the

198
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,839
challenges and so i'll get back to that

199
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
in just a little bit

200
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,079
solutions

201
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,440
number one i didn't know anything about

202
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
live streaming but my friend nick revell

203
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
he's the violist of the public quartet

204
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
local string quartet here in new york uh

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360
he

206
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
did and so he put me in touch with some

207
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
other streamers

208
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,519
and um they educated me very rapidly on

209
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,360
what i needed to know software i needed

210
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
to download

211
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
ways to control it live ways to interact

212
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,399
with the chat

213
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
and sort of general setup stuff

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
number two i had minimal streaming

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
equipment the solution was money

216
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
fortunately

217
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
umass lowell had not cut off my

218
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
professional development funds yet and

219
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,000
so i was able to purchase some streaming

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,399
equipment i got a little atem mini

221
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,800
switcher blackmagic design

222
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
a couple of other uh

223
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
acts or webcam stuff like that so i

224
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
could have some different camera angles

225
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
all that sort of stuff and then three

226
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
the solution to the collaboration not

227
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
really the solution but the the student

228
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
that i recruited to work with is ryan

229
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
katz there's a link to a really great

230
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
write-up uh about him

231
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,959
uh a profile he has uh he's been an

232
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
amazing resource for the ensemble and he

233
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
has some great sort of live ideas he's

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
done some live streaming that is

235
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
extraordinary as well up to this point

236
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,560
um

237
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
about uh three what i decided to do

238
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,560
with ryan is have him control my camera

239
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
streams so he stayed at his place and i

240
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
performed for my place but he was able

241
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
to control which camera angle was

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
happening at any one time through a

243
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
little web interface that i built

244
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
he was also able to control a little

245
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,480
pan-tilt camera mount that i had in my

246
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
basement so he could actually move

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
around and look at different things

248
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
and he also could control some some

249
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
visual effects and stuff like that

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,920
anyway the products of this streaming

251
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,959
endeavor for the fall 2020 semester was

252
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
the pan tilt system

253
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,160
again i don't want to get into this too

254
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,880
much but you can read more about this

255
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
here it was built on a nodemcu board

256
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
a max msp control interface for the pan

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,920
tilt system and the blackmagic design

258
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,399
a10 mini so max msp was controlling both

259
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
of these things simultaneously

260
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
this was all done with a protocol called

261
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,279
miroweb that's part of max msp

262
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,600
and he could just go to a website to

263
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
control this stuff for me

264
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,440
for the the uh

265
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
there's some links to some of the

266
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
performances so you can see what

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
actually resulted i was extremely happy

268
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
with it

269
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,079
i'm doing

270
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,000
at 1 am tonight i'm doing unfiltered

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
in 416

272
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,959
but

273
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,639
there's a couple of links here and then

274
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,240
the contemporary electronic ensemble

275
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
concerts i required the students to do

276
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
live performance and so the products of

277
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
that were a bunch of really really

278
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
terrific live performances and two of

279
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
the real big highlights for me were

280
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
these two here uh a piece called night

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
run by sean levine

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,800
it's actually a video game he

283
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
coded a video game and wrote the music

284
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,720
for it and played it live on twitch for

285
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
us

286
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
so that we could

287
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
experience the game and

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
and it was part of the inspiration for

289
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
building minecraft into this curriculum

290
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
uh so so i definitely owe him

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
something for for giving me these ideas

292
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,759
and then of course i featured a piece by

293
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
ryan uh he did a live performance where

294
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
he built a little drum machine and then

295
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
deployed it live so anyway i thought i'd

296
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
share a couple of those

297
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,519
those projects with you again if you

298
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
want to click through by all means

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,959
enter minecraft so where

300
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,519
minecraft is a popular game a few people

301
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
play it it's

302
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
it's relatively popular

303
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
my daughter was one of those people

304
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
and she was six at the time when we were

305
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,199
doing this

306
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
and so

307
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
at one point i saw her um

308
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
interacting with the game and i realized

309
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
well you know when she makes

310
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
interactions in the game there's real

311
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,079
time sounds and then she was playing

312
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,000
minecraft with a colleague of mine's son

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,880
they

314
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
joined together with the education

315
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,880
edition and uh they were able to do

316
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
things in real time and i thought okay

317
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
well one of the things that we lost

318
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,320
with ensembles

319
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
during covid was real-time interaction

320
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,679
everyone was recording their parts and

321
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
emailing them to the next person who

322
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,880
would record their parts and it wasn't

323
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
real time it was really

324
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,559
it was a huge loss for ensembles and so

325
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
i had this idea that maybe minecraft

326
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,359
helps us get a get that back

327
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
somehow at least people are building

328
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
these projects together

329
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,400
and then

330
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
on top of that

331
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
there's all sorts of different mechanics

332
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
in minecraft that can be hacked there's

333
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
the whole redstone world there's command

334
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
blocks there's structure blocks there's

335
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
mods and all sorts of things that you

336
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
can add to the game

337
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
it's an incredibly

338
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
expressive and complex

339
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
piece of software and so it was just

340
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
as an observer i saw this game and i

341
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
thought well it's a block game first you

342
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
know my daughter first started playing

343
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
it and then i came around

344
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,080
and started to realize wait a minute

345
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
there's something here this is high tech

346
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,760
this is

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
some uh some powerful stuff

348
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
so

349
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
that was my decision making process so

350
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,360
then this is

351
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
i'm just gonna sort of go off the of the

352
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
rails here but

353
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,039
what i decided for the spring semester

354
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
was that i wanted to do another twitch

355
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
concert

356
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
but i wanted to perform all of my music

357
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
in minecraft

358
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
so that was that was the next step how

359
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,520
was i going to do that so um

360
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
i i came up with the concept and then i

361
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
came up with this kind of data flow

362
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,960
system

363
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,679
so uh we scheduled for april 1st

364
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,919
this was it wasn't a joke it was a real

365
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
thing that happened but it was scheduled

366
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
for april 1st 2021

367
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
and what i wanted

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
to be able to do

369
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
is use the twitch chat to control

370
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
elements of my game

371
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,600
so maybe some basic control things maybe

372
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
turn it on once in a while so that

373
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,360
people could actually feel like they're

374
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
doing something in the chat get some

375
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
actual interaction and so what i did is

376
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,679
i i sort of devised this thing and then

377
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,600
i had to figure out how to do it it took

378
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,919
a long time i'm not a programmer but i

379
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
decided i wanted to make this happen and

380
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
fortunately i did so the twitch chat is

381
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,320
connected to max for live with a

382
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
protocol that's called

383
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
twitch plays max msp i think or twitch

384
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,919
plays max or something somebody wrote a

385
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,080
nice node.js script for this um so it's

386
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,559
uh processing in max for live max for

387
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,160
live is of course talking to ableton

388
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,679
ableton is then doing all these other

389
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,320
things sending stuff to max for live um

390
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
in order to control the game i

391
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
discovered that there was some real

392
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
problems with keyboard emulation

393
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,480
with max for live and so what i ended up

394
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,440
doing is

395
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,559
just

396
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,039
doing a real quick program for a tnc 3.2

397
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,160
midian hid controls out

398
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
worked pretty well

399
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
it's rock solid

400
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
it hasn't hasn't failed me yet and then

401
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
of course ableton live is doing all the

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
signal processing and stuff like that

403
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
and so that's hitting our ears there's

404
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,440
midi controlling the gameplay control

405
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
there's also envelope following that's

406
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,799
contr that's controlling left and right

407
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
movements and things like that

408
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,159
cliff x pro is scripting language remote

409
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,440
script in

410
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
for ableton that

411
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
is doing some of the hard heavy lifting

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
for the control stuff like that and then

413
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,679
of course i was doing things like video

414
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
processing which you can see down here

415
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
anyway this is the general flow of what

416
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
i wanted to happen and this is exactly

417
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,080
what did happen with void loop

418
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
um

419
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,200
before i show you the the void loop

420
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,720
things i'll take a quick departure

421
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
to the uh

422
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
a twitch installation that i have

423
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,640
running uh right now it's running 24 7.

424
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
it hasn't crashed yet in the last

425
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
three or four days it's

426
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,640
moderately stable if you ask me but this

427
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,799
uses kind of a similar

428
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,000
setup

429
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
except ableton live it's using max msp

430
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,440
instead for all this the signal

431
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
processing

432
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
and it's using a mind flayer bot

433
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,400
basically a player bot that i can send

434
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,520
commands to

435
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,159
uh in order to do different things and

436
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,760
so i have it loaded up here uh i i hope

437
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
it doesn't

438
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
crash

439
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
while i'm trying to uh to demonstrate it

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
uh here it is

441
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,280
and uh let's see

442
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,470
can i see the chat

443
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,559
[Music]

444
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,159
i guess i can't see the chat while i go

445
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,360
full screen so i'll just leave it like

446
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
this

447
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
uh anyway so there's some uh some sort

448
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
of basic commands here so we can reset

449
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
there's always a little bit of lag but

450
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
here's uh the sort of default state of

451
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
the installation

452
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,960
um you can send sort of basic commands

453
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
so if you want to fly up uh you can type

454
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,159
space

455
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,360
for

456
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,320
oh

457
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
type it right space for two seconds

458
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,000
it'll hold down the spacebar for two

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
seconds which will

460
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
make me fly up into the air

461
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
i can type right

462
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,720
and

463
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
we can say right for two seconds and

464
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
then hit the w key for

465
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
10 seconds

466
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,039
and

467
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,679
it'll turn right while walking

468
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,840
while moving

469
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,600
forward and so there's some

470
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
some basic controls that you can you can

471
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
use for this installation but the idea

472
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
behind this was that i wanted this to be

473
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,400
become a sort of ever expanding

474
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
collection of installations

475
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
musical vignettes if you will and so you

476
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,080
can see some of the projects here

477
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
the first one

478
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
was uh solfeggio this is a piece that i

479
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
did not compose but i put together the

480
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
the mechanics behind it

481
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
this is a piece by arvo pert called

482
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
solfegio

483
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
and is basically just a major scale in a

484
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,039
quirky order uh i think it happens

485
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
this major scale happens seven times

486
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
it's just one of the most beautiful

487
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
pieces you'll you'll ever hear

488
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,799
maybe not my version but

489
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,760
his version of it and the thunder really

490
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,039
adds to the ambience

491
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
there's a little bit of interactivity to

492
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
this as you can see i can stop i can

493
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,170
walk backwards

494
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,080
[Music]

495
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,120
i think i can add nausea

496
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
there we go

497
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,559
oh now we got some snow this is this

498
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,080
worked out perfectly the timing was

499
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,919
great

500
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,360
anyway that's enough of that if you if

501
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,559
you want to experience the whole thing

502
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,159
then you can check out the installation

503
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
on your own

504
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,520
um

505
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,320
one of the

506
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
original one of the void loop

507
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
performances uh

508
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
didn't quite work out to be an

509
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
appropriate thing for stage performance

510
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
uh is actually a piece of music that my

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,640
daughter wrote

512
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,559
uh and we wanted to choreograph some

513
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,960
dance moves to it and so i'll share

514
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
i'll share that one with you here that

515
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
so she wrote the music and then i

516
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,600
figured out how to program the dance

517
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
moves

518
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
this one's called mind minecraft she was

519
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,719
seven when she wrote the music

520
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
and there's not a ton of interaction

521
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120
here but it's you know it's a piece of

522
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,919
music that uh that gets deployed in real

523
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,919
time

524
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,559
[Music]

525
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,679
and the dance moves are mostly

526
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,200
randomized there's a couple of things

527
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,960
that happen consistently so there's like

528
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,279
the sort of up and down movements of the

529
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,880
head and then the

530
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
crouching and standing up those are

531
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,830
specifically timed to match the beat

532
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,020
[Music]

533
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:35,240
[Music]

534
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,080
all right and then um

535
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
i don't know i don't think i'll go

536
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,679
through all these with you but um

537
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
let's see there we go

538
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
probably the most work went into this

539
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
one that's called maze

540
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,640
and it is a 3d maze that people in the

541
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
chat can actually solve if they really

542
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,559
wanted to it's super difficult

543
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,000
but basically the way it works is

544
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,919
there's music playing

545
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,039
and

546
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,080
max msp is actually um

547
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,240
intercepting my coordinate data from the

548
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
world and so i'm able to control

549
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
different parameters by moving closer to

550
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,240
goals and things like that and so i'll

551
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,520
go ahead and

552
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
walk forward here

553
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,199
and you'll probably hear a small change

554
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,880
so you can hear that a filter is being

555
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,400
opened up here just a low-pass filter

556
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,240
but it's trying to do this

557
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
in front of an audience right now i have

558
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
so much pressure i don't think i'm going

559
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,200
to do very well

560
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,640
and

561
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
i tried it out once to see how long it

562
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
would take to solve the maze it probably

563
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,159
takes about five minutes start to finish

564
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,640
if you're patient with it um that being

565
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
said i also know my way through the maze

566
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,080
so somebody who's trying it for the

567
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,679
first time would probably take much

568
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,799
longer

569
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
but it's basically that it's uh it's a

570
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,320
way for

571
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
people to

572
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
play a game but also have something

573
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
musical happen at the same time so

574
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,480
expressivity through gameplay that's

575
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
that's my sort of main charge in this

576
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,600
case

577
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
there's a couple more

578
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
one of the most basic ones uh is just a

579
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
a shuffle jukebox so when you type

580
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,399
shuffle it'll

581
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,480
play something for you oh i can't i

582
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
can't play that one because uh i'm

583
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,799
playing that tonight

584
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
so this will just play a random track

585
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
from a jukebox that i put together um

586
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,440
it's

587
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
it doesn't do anything besides play the

588
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
track

589
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,799
i have plans at some point to create a

590
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
sort of dance option so if somebody

591
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,360
wanted

592
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,240
the player to move automatically to the

593
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
music that'll happen it just hasn't

594
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,840
happened yet

595
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
it'll probably a lot of the music i

596
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,320
write is ambient or textural so it's not

597
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,360
going to be

598
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,200
rhythmic dance moves but maybe something

599
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,360
where certain frequencies get louder you

600
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,320
move forward or up or down or whatever

601
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
but that's the

602
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,559
that's the general idea behind it

603
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,480
you can

604
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
explore the entire world but there's no

605
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,399
um

606
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,200
clicking or right-clicking available

607
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
for good reason because i don't want

608
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,880
people in the chat to actually be able

609
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,919
to build or tear things down so that's

610
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,960
uh that'll probably never be a thing

611
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
um a couple of other ones this was

612
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,000
actually kind of a proof of concept

613
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
thing but i

614
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
downloaded a whole bunch of sounds from

615
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,480
nasa

616
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,840
and just put them into this kind of

617
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
ambient soundscape with a couple of

618
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,760
spirals where the is just kind of

619
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
floating around in the world

620
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,039
and

621
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
it'll start here in just a moment

622
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
there's a bit of interaction here too

623
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
for stopping and starting

624
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,840
things like that but

625
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,240
it's fairly fairly basic interaction in

626
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
this case

627
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,880
and as you see as as

628
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
the characters kind of flying through

629
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
there's some command blocks and the

630
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,559
command blocks are basically just

631
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,360
playing the sounds on repeat

632
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
so

633
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,960
technically it would sound the same

634
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,240
every single time unless a chat user

635
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,159
decided to stop or start it and then it

636
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,200
would sound a little bit different

637
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
in that instance

638
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
and again this this one is more like a

639
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
proof of concept but i left it in

640
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
because it worked and then when i got to

641
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,360
the bottom again the max msp patch is

642
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
interpreting my coordinates and so it

643
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,919
reverses the direction and has me rise

644
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,240
to the top

645
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,760
and uh one more just because it was

646
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,679
super fun to put together this one's

647
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,399
called a series of tubes

648
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
and it's

649
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,080
i replaced a whole bunch of game sounds

650
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,279
with uh different kind of uh textural

651
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
things uh some of the uh the mob sounds

652
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
are replaced with these kind of repeated

653
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
rhythmic things uh you can see the tubes

654
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,080
here and you can see some different uh

655
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
npcs just kind of dropping through the

656
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,919
world in these tubes

657
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,000
there's a little bit of choreography at

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
the beginning here so i made a little

659
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,760
loading screen

660
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,039
[Applause]

661
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
and then as you get down to the bottom

662
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,080
uh

663
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
if anyone knows the game what i ended up

664
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
doing is i replaced the lava sounds with

665
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
some of these synthetic sounds i

666
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
replaced the piglens and the piglet

667
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,799
brute sounds

668
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,159
and

669
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,520
i think that's pretty much it so these

670
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
are the sounds that you're hearing and

671
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
of course you can

672
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,120
you know do our normal

673
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,679
kind of spin moves

674
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,679
you can do uh you know half a second of

675
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,399
moving the mouse up

676
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
and because the sounds are directional

677
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,559
you can actually if you're using

678
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,760
headphones you can hear where these

679
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,679
different things are happening

680
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,880
and you can also fly up

681
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
nope that's not what i meant to do uh

682
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,559
you can fly up by using the space bar

683
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,600
that was look up anyway here will

684
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,799
rise

685
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,799
just

686
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
and so there's a handful of interactive

687
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,000
controls for kind of experiencing the

688
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,039
sound

689
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,960
again it's not designed to be a toe

690
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
tapper or you're not supposed to dance

691
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,200
through anything it's really atmospheric

692
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
textual music

693
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,240
and i'll reset that

694
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,520
so the

695
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,480
[Applause]

696
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
a lot of these different control schemes

697
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,799
were born out of this live performance

698
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,559
that i put together the the void loop

699
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,320
performance i'll be doing a few of those

700
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,919
pieces at 1am

701
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,120
uh tonight

702
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,919
um

703
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,600
not all of them but just

704
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,519
the the last three of them

705
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,760
but i wanted to take things further i

706
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,840
wanted this to sort of grow into a

707
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
longer term project

708
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
incidentally i am

709
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,440
on the lookout for collaborators for

710
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,799
people who want to contribute music or

711
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,440
ideas to this so if anyone has some

712
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
ideas or wants to just simply feature

713
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,559
track of yours i can easily add tracks

714
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
to the jukebox things like that

715
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
or we could

716
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,720
talk about developing some kind of

717
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,840
actual custom project so um so this is

718
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
this is meant to be a long-term kind of

719
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,840
permanent installation uh it's been

720
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
running three days without a problem so

721
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,960
i'm hoping i'm hoping it continues to uh

722
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
i figured since uh you know we're at a

723
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
hacker's conference uh we should uh

724
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
maybe take a look at some of the the

725
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,399
the code the scripts and stuff like that

726
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,480
uh so the first one i gotta scroll down

727
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,799
real quick before i make uh my

728
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
authorization codes available and this

729
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
is the uh again i'm not a programmer so

730
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,679
please be gentle with uh

731
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,080
criticisms on on my script here

732
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
but this is a combination mind flayer

733
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
and node.js

734
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,919
twitch

735
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,120
chat

736
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
relay kind of thing

737
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,159
it uses my port number on the local host

738
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,519
so this is a computer running in my

739
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
basement currently

740
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
to create a bot that i call botbot and

741
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
then there's a

742
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,440
the twitch plays max has this nice max

743
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,519
api handler where you can have it

744
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,919
recognize different messages and spit

745
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,159
out different things and so i can make

746
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,559
the uh the bot go into spectator mode

747
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,080
which is why the bot's invisible you

748
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,200
can't see it

749
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
it can teleport me to different places

750
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,559
or it can teleport to me and stuff like

751
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,840
that it can also send

752
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,159
chat bot chat commands and so that's

753
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,520
what how i was able to do things like

754
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
the nausea

755
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,879
basically giving me an effect and things

756
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,560
like that so that's that's one of the

757
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
the sort of underlying things here

758
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,159
there's also a number of

759
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,359
these these are the the handlers for all

760
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,199
the different tracks so in the jukebox

761
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
it basically will

762
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,359
post something to the twitch chat

763
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
that tells you what the track is who's

764
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,119
playing on it and all that sort of good

765
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,719
stuff

766
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,000
then

767
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
i think there's probably something else

768
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,119
worth talking about here but that's most

769
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,440
of what this script is doing and it's

770
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
being handled inside

771
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,839
max msp

772
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
i'll show you the the patch often i

773
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,240
append little fixes to it

774
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
looks a little bit like this

775
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
and

776
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
i've tried to keep it organized i'm

777
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,480
doing an okay job

778
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,839
it's not running on this computer but

779
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,359
these three green boxes are where we

780
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
would get the coordinates the xyz in the

781
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,720
world

782
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
theoretically i can also get rotation

783
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
information

784
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,520
um and

785
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,400
other

786
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
such things other kind of world

787
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
information things but currently i'm

788
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,400
only using the xyz for some of the

789
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
projects it's mostly working it's a

790
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,800
little bit clunky at times but it does

791
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
in fact get the job done and so a lot of

792
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
times what i have to do is

793
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,720
[Music]

794
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,200
give it a little bit of fuzzy logic get

795
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,680
kind of close to values to do certain

796
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,320
things just so that i um

797
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,520
can

798
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,599
can actually trigger things at the the

799
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,760
right time

800
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,480
i'm running an instance of black hole so

801
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
the sound is going through black hole

802
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
intercepted into the

803
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
the patch and then being spit out

804
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
through another it doesn't say here but

805
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,839
another instance of black hole which is

806
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,720
then

807
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,119
going to obs which is streaming uh 24 7.

808
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,119
the there's nothing uh super super

809
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,240
special here

810
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
except for maybe the the move

811
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,520
elements again this is a tnt 3.2

812
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,800
and it's

813
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,880
using

814
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,359
midi cc values to uh to control the

815
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,280
different keyboard commands and and

816
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
mouse commands and things like that

817
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,119
obs is being controlled a couple

818
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,920
different ways one just through midi

819
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,800
it's

820
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,079
been different scenes are being

821
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
triggered with midi but it's also using

822
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,680
osc because midi

823
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,079
pro proved to be unreliable for starting

824
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,480
and stopping the stream so

825
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,599
you can see

826
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
somewhere over here

827
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
udp send this is sending all the osc

828
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,040
messages to uh to obs

829
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
um

830
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,640
i don't get stuck on this i want to move

831
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,839
on to just some in-world things to talk

832
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,160
about at the end of this but this is

833
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,960
basically the patch itself

834
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,320
i'm trying to create a different module

835
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
for each of these different

836
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
these different

837
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
projects

838
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,480
it's rather there's probably a better

839
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,280
way of doing it but it's piecemeal a new

840
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,320
project happens so i go and i retrofit

841
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
everything to sort of work with the new

842
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,079
project and then

843
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,720
use some different handlers

844
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,079
for i have the thing called message

845
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,920
handler which intercepts all the twitch

846
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,079
chat and then just formats it into a new

847
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,359
thing that's a little bit easier for me

848
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,079
to work with within max

849
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,880
so that is uh

850
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
that is that

851
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
so that's that's one

852
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
that's kind of the big

853
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
development that's one of the things i'm

854
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,160
i'm continually working on but let's

855
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,040
let's uh let's take a step back

856
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
and uh we'll

857
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
go into an actual minecraft world here

858
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,240
for for a little bit so

859
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,280
this um

860
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,200
this was the the performance i did for

861
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
you at the beginning uh of the session

862
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
here this is called fees farewell

863
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
and it's um

864
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,440
first of all i gotta i gotta get rid of

865
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,079
the birds uh because they're uh in the

866
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,240
way

867
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,359
so apology

868
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,400
i'm so sorry i didn't mean for this to

869
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
become so violent but um

870
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
it had to happen otherwise they're going

871
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,720
to follow me the whole time so

872
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,598
here's uh

873
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
the building i work in is called durgan

874
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
hall and uh

875
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,520
i decided uh kind of early on that i

876
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,400
should

877
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
i should build durgan hall

878
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,440
and it's a brutalist building made of

879
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,520
lots of concrete and it's the weirdest

880
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,599
shape thing you've ever seen but if you

881
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,880
ever want to take a look at umass

882
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
lowell's durgan hall it looks very

883
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,599
similar to this

884
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,280
i built it so that we could build some

885
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,960
things on the stage and in fact some of

886
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
the first performances of these

887
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
minecraft projects took place on the

888
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
stage

889
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,520
of um

890
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,760
of durgan home at the virtual durgan

891
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,960
home

892
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
originally the idea was that i was going

893
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,640
to make it just kind of a jumping off

894
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
point and so i used command blocks

895
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,359
these uh i designed these command block

896
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
skins myself just because i didn't like

897
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,599
the the regular ones

898
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,400
but

899
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
they were just ways to teleport to these

900
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,240
different projects and things like that

901
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
and then i discovered a mod that's

902
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,400
called waystones which allows you to

903
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
save these different places and so this

904
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,599
was um a way

905
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,119
this is our umass lowell music server

906
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,920
and

907
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,320
i encourage creative only projects on

908
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,960
this for all of my students and who want

909
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
to do minecraft projects in the ensemble

910
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,599
but also anyone in the department who

911
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,920
wants to work on it and so we've had a

912
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,160
little bit of sort of extracurricular

913
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,920
stuff happening here

914
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,240
um

915
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,560
let's see if i can find it here so

916
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,640
this started with this right here this

917
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,880
is really haphazard but what i tried to

918
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
do is make it kind of educational for

919
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,119
the students give them some options for

920
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,680
how to make different sounds in the game

921
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,760
how to manipulate those game mechanics

922
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
into something expressive and so the

923
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,520
easiest thing is note blocks you see all

924
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
these noteblock projects so i tried to

925
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,680
sort of lay them out here for everyone

926
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,839
and then the the next

927
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,280
i don't want that to be too loud but the

928
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
next big thing is timing how do you do

929
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,119
timing in the game and

930
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,240
those of you who are familiar with

931
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
redstone know that there's easy ways to

932
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
create clocks and so i just started

933
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,200
building a bunch of clocks just to

934
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
demonstrate them i tried to do some that

935
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,680
weren't really out in the world so these

936
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,520
kind of sand timers

937
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
falling sand and things like that

938
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,599
that actually turned into some other

939
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,680
things but i you know this is kind of

940
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,720
the the beginnings of of uh some ideas

941
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
for different projects then of course

942
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,480
you can do minecart

943
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
clocks

944
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
it's not the most expressive tune but

945
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,680
it's a tune and you can always tweak

946
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,839
this to something that

947
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,119
that works a little bit better

948
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,040
and so

949
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,079
um

950
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,240
i linked to a piece earlier by sean

951
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,400
levine um he actually created uh so he

952
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,960
wrote he wrote this video game called

953
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,000
night run

954
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
but he also created one of the first

955
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,839
really really impressive machines inside

956
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,920
the server and so this was his this is

957
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,079
called groovecraft and it's a drum

958
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
machine

959
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,359
and these are switches for different

960
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,119
drums sound uh sorry this is the bass

961
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,119
sounds

962
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
so you can change the rhythms

963
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
[Music]

964
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
and so on and so forth and so he created

965
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,040
it as a two-player experience it was uh

966
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,040
it was a way for two people to kind of

967
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
interact and create music improvise

968
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
around some different parameters and

969
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
create something on the fly and so it

970
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,359
was really kind of the first test of

971
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,240
real-time interactivity inside the game

972
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,720
for the ensemble so

973
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,520
i

974
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
really really felt compelled to share

975
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,200
this with you it is a complex beast here

976
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,560
in the back sean is now working for a

977
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
boys and girls club in the boston area

978
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,640
and he managed to get a really nice

979
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,680
grant for minecraft music projects and

980
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,359
so he's doing some of the same things

981
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,760
that i'm doing now so really really sort

982
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,319
of proud of the work that he's doing um

983
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,119
so that's uh that's one of the the first

984
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,000
uh

985
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,760
big projects the big permanent projects

986
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,359
there were of course some others

987
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,720
but a lot of those were designed to be

988
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,960
just kind of one-time performances

989
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,720
they were really hard to recreate and

990
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
they weren't something that i could

991
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,839
really demonstrate here

992
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,680
let's see

993
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,280
this is

994
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,000
this is the

995
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,040
the latest and greatest of our mods here

996
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,880
and so this server is running the create

997
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
mod

998
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,680
um some of you may have seen it but you

999
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
can create all these great mechanical

1000
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,880
machines and things like that and so i

1001
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,240
didn't know anything about the cream on

1002
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,599
so i decided let's get in there and

1003
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,440
let's build some stuff

1004
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,640
and see how it works and so this one's a

1005
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,240
parrot sequencer

1006
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,880
where you can see them just teleporting

1007
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,319
it's not the most musical thing but it's

1008
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,960
a nice proof of concept

1009
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,079
and so that was one of the mechanics

1010
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,760
that you saw on the fees farewell

1011
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
performance earlier

1012
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,319
um over here was another one there's a

1013
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,240
mushroom that's just been kind of hurled

1014
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
around in the world on these different

1015
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
ejector plates

1016
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,000
and each time it hits

1017
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,359
there's a

1018
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,759
sound

1019
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,280
that's fun i guess

1020
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,240
if you like mushrooms

1021
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,960
and then here's a

1022
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
spinning sequencer using uh some of

1023
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,440
these different uh mechanical bearings

1024
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,359
and things like that it plays steve

1025
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,680
reich's uh piano phase one of them

1026
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,280
slightly faster than the other i thought

1027
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,130
just a nice way to test the system

1028
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:16,800
[Music]

1029
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,319
it's all right

1030
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,680
there's there's better things to do with

1031
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,440
it but but it was a it was a way to sort

1032
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,240
of test things out

1033
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,040
one

1034
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,680
more stop here i think

1035
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
um

1036
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,599
visuals i think are also kind of an

1037
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,280
important element to this

1038
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,079
and

1039
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,760
so you saw in that performance there

1040
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,280
were these animations of the legend of

1041
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,319
zelda the original nes sprites

1042
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,720
and so this is um

1043
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
this is how i did it so these these are

1044
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,280
being animated by

1045
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
basically just replacing blocks and so

1046
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,760
you can see my animation frames up here

1047
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,560
they're

1048
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,640
all sort of in a row

1049
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,280
and i'm just basically replacing

1050
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,960
different parts of the world with that

1051
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,119
and so those are triggered in time and

1052
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,200
things like that and so again this was

1053
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,920
really about creating a series of timing

1054
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,839
elements and things like that

1055
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,590
so

1056
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,240
[Music]

1057
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,520
so hopefully that gives you kind of a

1058
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,200
sense of some of these different

1059
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,800
elements that

1060
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,680
that

1061
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,839
i've put together one last little thing

1062
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,839
and then i'll open it up for questions

1063
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,200
is

1064
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,560
the

1065
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,400
let's see i've got a little demo project

1066
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
here

1067
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,400
i just need to make a quick little five

1068
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,359
minutes thank you

1069
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
i don't give a give away too much

1070
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,000
because i'm performing this tonight uh

1071
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,720
but this is um hopefully i got this all

1072
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,359
set up here this is one of the ableton

1073
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
live

1074
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,200
sets that i use to process some of this

1075
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,240
stuff

1076
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
if if you've never heard of clip x pro

1077
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,760
it's

1078
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
no longer being made i don't think i

1079
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,119
don't think there's any plans to update

1080
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,040
it so it's really sad but it is

1081
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
absolutely the most powerful scripting

1082
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
tool for ableton live

1083
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,760
you can do all sorts of things with it

1084
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,599
but it's got all sorts of commands in

1085
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,960
here that sort of control it and

1086
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,520
basically what happens here see if i can

1087
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
find a good

1088
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
sound for you

1089
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,799
i know where some sounds are

1090
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,800
so what i did is i replaced a whole

1091
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,920
bunch of game sounds

1092
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,839
and as you can see the audio is routed

1093
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,000
through ableton and so that opens up a

1094
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,560
whole world of audio processing

1095
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,440
um

1096
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,520
anything you can do in ableton

1097
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,359
you can apply to minecraft in this case

1098
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,520
and so this uh this portion of the

1099
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,960
performance is

1100
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,800
um

1101
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,480
a lot of it is me controlling ableton

1102
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,319
with a foot controller while i'm playing

1103
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,720
the game things like that and so there's

1104
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,839
different things that happen at

1105
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,319
different moments based on my actual

1106
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,160
physical interactions

1107
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,000
in some cases they're kind of randomly

1108
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,960
happening

1109
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,920
and

1110
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
there's

1111
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,680
what i'll be doing tonight at 1 am are

1112
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,920
three of the pieces from this so i'll be

1113
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,440
doing a piece that's called

1114
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,040
it's a long name pink bats or something

1115
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,720
like it

1116
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,760
chicken hero villager hero cow hero

1117
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,480
and a piece by alessandro cortini called

1118
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,880
everything ends here so those three

1119
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,960
tunes are part of the the void loop

1120
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,559
performance

1121
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,000
they're

1122
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
currently the best of my performances i

1123
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,839
think

1124
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,240
and they're very deeply integrated into

1125
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,640
this sort of ableton live scripted

1126
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,079
environment

1127
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,040
um

1128
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,000
i would

1129
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,559
love to talk endlessly about this but i

1130
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,359
would like to at least

1131
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,760
ask for questions at this point

1132
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
does anyone have any questions

1133
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,920
crickets

1134
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,920
the the scripting of live is cliff x pro

1135
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,400
cliff x pro yes but

1136
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,839
can you not use the live api and access

1137
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,079
it through scripting and max and do

1138
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,079
whatever you want you could and and

1139
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,839
click x pro is not compatible with live

1140
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,800
11 it's only compatible with live 10 and

1141
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,960
so i've been spending a lot of time

1142
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,680
trying to do exactly that do some of

1143
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,520
these things that i do normally with

1144
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,960
cliff x

1145
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,359
as max for live patches it's super

1146
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,200
daunting though i don't know how

1147
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
i don't know how they manage to do it

1148
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,800
cliff x pro is really elegant it can do

1149
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,480
hundreds of operations all at the same

1150
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,359
time

1151
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,440
oh wow max for live

1152
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,640
technically you could do hundreds of

1153
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,000
operations but you have to program every

1154
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,200
single one

1155
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,598
okay

1156
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,800
you can still get cliff x regular it's

1157
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,839
free

1158
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,200
um

1159
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,440
for ableton live 11. it's been updated

1160
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,160
for that but it's missing a lot of the a

1161
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,960
lot of the power of cliff x pro

1162
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,520
but the cliff x3 is also

1163
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,359
being discontinued

1164
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,480
well no it's open source so okay so yeah

1165
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,280
cliff x regular just called cliff x is

1166
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
uh is open source

1167
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,520
i believe it's

1168
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,599
maintained pretty well

1169
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,240
bug fixes and things like that but

1170
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,079
the problem is cliff x pro is commercial

1171
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,880
software and so it can't

1172
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,000
be retrofitted to open source software

1173
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,599
right yep

1174
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,480
okay thanks

1175
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,040
hi so excluding the

1176
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,000
in-game minecraft sounds does minecraft

1177
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,640
have a sound like if

1178
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,319
would you be able to tell

1179
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,920
that someone was sequencing sounds

1180
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,359
through minecraft like are there any

1181
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,839
like distinct you know qualities

1182
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,359
probably at least i've been told that so

1183
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,480
like the

1184
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,000
one of the pieces chicken hero villager

1185
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,400
hero cow hero people recognize the game

1186
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
sounds right away you hear the minecraft

1187
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,000
chickens and the villager sounds and

1188
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,160
it's it's really distinctive

1189
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,839
a lot of what i'd encourage my students

1190
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,599
to do it's really easy to replace game

1191
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,480
sounds super super easy and so it's

1192
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,000
basically like a really

1193
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,240
interesting sampler

1194
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,520
yeah

1195
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,400
thank you sure

1196
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,440
i think we're almost out of time so

1197
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,280
it'll have to be the last question

1198
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,240
yeah besides the twitch integration how

1199
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,480
hard would it be to port the max aspect

1200
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,160
to pure data i'm sorry i didn't hear the

1201
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,079
first part besides the twitch

1202
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,280
integration

1203
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,040
how hard would it be to

1204
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,839
port your max patches to pure data pure

1205
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,839
data

1206
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,920
um i don't know i don't know pd all that

1207
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,240
well i don't

1208
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,160
think it would be super super difficult

1209
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,720
because it's all just

1210
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,520
i mean it's mostly vanilla objects and

1211
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,240
then um

1212
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,400
if there's a way to

1213
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,240
install a node.js script into pd then it

1214
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,280
should be the same basic idea okay thank

1215
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,440
you

1216
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,920
all right thanks so much

1217
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:30,239
