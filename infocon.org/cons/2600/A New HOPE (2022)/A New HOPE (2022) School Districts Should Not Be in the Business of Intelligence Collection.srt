are school districts across the country

seeking out covert

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
unaccountable means of gathering

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,240
intelligence

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
of the what has been hap what has been

60
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
happening why parents are reacting the

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,319
way they are in certain areas of the

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,920
country

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
i'll talk about the school's social

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
media monitoring policy what's what it

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
was purported to actually represent

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,519
which most of us agree on and then how

67
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
they're trying to modify that to lose to

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
no kidding actually create

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
a

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
intelligence collection platform that's

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
not just directed at students but

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,120
towards parents or anything that might

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
actually be associated as a threat to a

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
brand in the schools and we can see

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
where that could be potential misuse

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
um nationwide trends where this is

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
coming out and i'll give you an update

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
of like what we're doing as parents what

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,920
we're doing is parents actually combat

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,159

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
between these groups but between school

boards and some of the behaviors and

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
activities that they've been doing and

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
it's creating like a soup which is

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
creating a big which is why a lot of

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
parents are fighting and you start

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,760
seeing a lot of different alliances

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
all of those dossiers that you see in

149
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,000
your james bond films determining people

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
information security officer so i still

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
you know i'm still within the community

174
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
i'm still doing the same things i have

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,199
survived this so yes my activism has not

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
uh detracted from has not had a negative

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
impact on my professional career so i

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
can still talk a lot of trash and get

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
away with it

180
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
so oh and by the way my whistleblowing

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
case that's actually still open that is

182
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
still an investigation that i blew the

183
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
whistle on back in 2016

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
when you have a bunch of guys who are

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,800
using uh federal funds to go to the

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
olympics um

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
nfl playoff games

188
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
some good old nascar events as well some

189
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
good old southern boys good ol good old

190
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,720
boy network and i blew the whistle on

191
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,080
that um one thing that i did do which

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
a lot of other people i've noticed who

193
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
blew the whistle i actually kept

194
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
receipts like i actually had like audio

195
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
recordings and i kept emails and you

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,840
know i kept

197
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
i did keep all of that and

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
it's kind of an interesting experience

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
not a fun one definitely not fun but

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
make sure that you're right if you're

201
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,599
ever going to do that if you're ever

202
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,800
going to blow the whistle on something

203
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
but if you want to talk to me about that

204
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,039
later you know i can

205
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
i do i do talk for beer i get better

206
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,240
with every beer that i drink when i want

207
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
to talk about some of these stories okay

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
all right

209
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
so

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
wow

211
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
how did i end up

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
in some of these things now don't

213
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,680
pay too much attention to

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
this i mean i'm not some anti-crt i just

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
don't like the way how they try to

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
implement it which is the really the big

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
issue right you just can't really

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,199
discriminate against one group because

219
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,280
you can't put a level of human hierarchy

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
you can't

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
place of value of uh you can't put a

222
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,400
hierarchy in human misery you know

223
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,240
because every especially in fairfax it's

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
a very diverse area everyone has

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
different issues

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
um

227
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
but these are some of the things i was

228
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
actually the first uh black president of

229
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
the pta

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
at thomas jefferson high school science

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
and technology nation's number one high

232
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
school we're actually serious

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
competition for stuyvesant

234
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,039
i know i talk trash to a lot of stylists

235
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,080
and parents i've been a lot i'm in

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
contact with some new york parents here

237
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
i know new york's got a great education

238
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,319
system

239
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,360
um

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
so uh but we had a lot of challenges we

241
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
talked about

242
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,919
uh the changes to admissions process now

243
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,760
i'm a father right how many dads are

244
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,039
really involved in like their kids

245
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
school

246
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,919
okay you got some great good on you all

247
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
right now let me tell you this um

248
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
was it a challenge being involved

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
yes it is right because it's just like

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
you know you walk into there's that

251
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
hierarchy right i mean i was a single

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
dad at one point right and you walk in

253
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
you try to volunteer it's come was like

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
that hierarchy that uh

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
that alpha female um

256
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
room mom you know i'm talking about guys

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
like who wants to volunteer and you

258
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
raise your hand all you hear is a grunt

259
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
and then everyone looks right to the mom

260
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
who's been experienced and she's like oh

261
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
she's in charge and there's the dad

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
you're like okay all you're going to do

263
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
is uh

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
you know if there's something heavy to

265
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
lift you go do it like okay fine you

266
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
know i'll be involved in my kid's life

267
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,279
uh my kids school and education but um

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
this kind of elevated with some of the

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
activism that we've seen down in

270
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,399
northern virginia

271
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,920
where

272
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
and this leads up to why would they

273
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,839
implement this type of a system

274
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
where a lot of parents that started

275
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
protesting

276
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,399
started getting doxxed by a school board

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,680
activists i have associations with the

278
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
school board

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,920
like they would actually put up with

280
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
dossier and doc's parents and actually

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
try and harass them

282
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
um

283
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
for a little bit about me what i also do

284
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
like i also like i volunteer like a

285
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
black student fund they're trying to

286
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
integrate or desegregate independent

287
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,440
schools

288
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
and i encountered it when i had somebody

289
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
call me a segregationist i was like

290
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
what did you just say to me

291
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,600
so it's like game on and then down in

292
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
fairfax virginia when a lot of parents

293
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
started protesting um some of the school

294
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,279
board policies

295
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
they started getting kicked out of their

296
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
local democratic party by school board

297
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
members

298
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,839
actually holding votes in fact i was

299
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
just a call an hour ago finding out like

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
you know like when people try to join

301
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
like their local democrats mostly it's

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
mostly democratic

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
and you find that you're getting voted

304
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
off the island

305
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,519
and so it's kind of like okay it's it's

306
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,880
it's game on

307
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
um

308
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
those are a couple of things and i can

309
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,920
tell you some other stories that i might

310
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
interject depending on the time i have

311
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
some other crazy things that have

312
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
happened

313
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,000
um

314
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,680
so

315
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
let's talk about schools that are

316
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,440
monitoring social media activity now

317
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
most of us agree on this

318
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
that schools are legally required to

319
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
have a direct plan to monitor a

320
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
student's internet presence what they're

321
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
doing online using school assets and

322
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
resources

323
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
typically they're only empowered to do

324
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,120
this on school issued emails or devices

325
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
though it varies by district and where

326
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
they might monitor

327
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
other social media activities for

328
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
harassment or bullying so they can

329
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,880
intervene i think most of us will agree

330
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
on this

331
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,839
now most schools

332
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
are starting to implement social media

333
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,959
monitoring programs under the

334
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,600
justification to identify potential

335
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
active potential active shooters

336
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
because you typically will have in the

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
initial phases of preparation phase and

338
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,200
when they actually will start acquiring

339
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
the means to actually develop the attack

340
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
you have to move very quickly

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,640
also to how for self-bullying and with

342
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
self-harm for those of us that had kids

343
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
the pandemic

344
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
i'm impacted by this i talk to a lot of

345
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
other parents that are affected by this

346
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,279
like you know mental health is a major

347
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
issue that has that has had that this

348
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
pandemic has had an effect remote

349
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
learning has just been a complete

350
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,770
disaster on our on our youth

351
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,160
[Music]

352
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
and uh

353
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
also mentioned here the educator school

354
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
safety network shows that most bomb

355
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
threats come from social media

356
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,040
now let's go into the nitty-gritty of

357
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
this speak about definitions right they

358
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
matter now i said like i'm also a

359
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
veteran retired navy intel officer so

360
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
you tell me i'm going to secure a room

361
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
that tells me to sweep up and close the

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
door you tell someone in the army to

363
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
secure a building that means constantino

364
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,839
wire guns and guards secure the room you

365
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
tell someone the marine corps that comes

366
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,959
in with overwhelming force kill

367
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,399
everything inside tell someone the air

368
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
force secure building it means oh five

369
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
year lease with an option to buy right

370
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
okay it's like you know

371
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,440
words really do have specific meanings

372
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
you know depending on the community that

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
you're talking to

374
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,440
so let's talk about like you know the

375
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
definition of a threat right that's a

376
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,040
cue that's communication or behavior

377
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
that you intend to harm someone can be

378
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
spoken written gestured

379
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,320
i'm not going to read the slides you can

380
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
read it there but then you can also do

381
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
like a threat assessment and coming from

382
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
an intelligence background one thing

383
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
that they really really instilled you as

384
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,720
icd-203 analytic standards and making

385
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,839
sure that you do not politicize

386
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,120
intelligence things go very bad when you

387
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
do that anyone remember beya pig or read

388
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
about bay of pigs it was supposed to be

389
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
it was supposed to fail it failed

390
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
spectacularly or cuban missile crisis

391
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,720
right

392
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
right but

393
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,519
in that one they kept on taking away

394
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
resources to

395
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
you know because they thought oh they'll

396
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,399
just take it over and they reduce

397
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,760
resources where it was a complete

398
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
disaster cuban missile crisis

399
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
classic case of mirror imaging fallacy

400
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
they're like no the russians would never

401
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
put ballistic missiles in uh medium

402
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,959
marine missiles in cuba because we would

403
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,800
they would lose their minds you know the

404
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
russians were like well you've got

405
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
jupiter missiles in turkey we'll just go

406
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
do the same thing to you and

407
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,040
we got very we came very close to world

408
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,599
war three

409
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
um when you talk about the threat and

410
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,240
mentioning this process it's you know

411
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
with the idea that gets implanted into

412
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
an actor a person who's an act who's in

413
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
who's a potential active shooter they

414
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
have the idea and then the planning

415
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,279
stage and you typically don't have

416
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
indications of when someone's in the

417
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
planning stage for those of us who have

418
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
like like the uvalde shootings

419
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
even columbine the planning stages that

420
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720
really doesn't have a lot of of

421
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
visibility but when you start acquiring

422
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,760
the means like you're actually

423
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,320
purchasing like an assault weapon or

424
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
uh you might you are requiring the

425
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,079
capability to do that that's typically

426
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,000
when you have that first indicator which

427
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,079
would require a rapid response which is

428
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,680
why schools have started having social

429
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
media monitoring to get ideas when

430
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,720
people are actually starting to have the

431
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
i the

432
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
idea that they might want to do this to

433
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,360
allow for rapid intervention

434
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,639
so our school policy

435
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
right we're the 11th largest school

436
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
district they've got over a three

437
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
billion dollar budget

438
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,199
which is dod-esque type of money which

439
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,120
is subject to rampant fraud waste and

440
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
abuse and with esser funds to help with

441
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,399
pandemic learning loss it's at 4 billion

442
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
they put an informal request for

443
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,079
proposal this is what governments use

444
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,360
when they want to require goods or

445
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,320
services from contractors

446
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
now what's really should be concerning

447
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
you about this is that fairfax county

448
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
typically with a lot of other school

449
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,519
districts around the country

450
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,160
will follow what fairfax does new york

451
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
is an exception they do what they do

452
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,079
other states actually follow what new

453
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,760
york does as well but they will

454
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
typically mirror what some of the larger

455
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
school districts will do

456
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
and this put up this for this this

457
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,680
typical rfp to expand the social media

458
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
research program now this sounds you

459
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
know benign nothing to really worry

460
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
about until you actually look at the rfp

461
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
and then you start realizing like oh my

462
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,320
god what are they what are these people

463
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
thinking

464
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,639
now this one was to expand it to deter

465
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,560
or to detect attorney negative actions

466
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
or consequences from social media which

467
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
may be directed to racial groups or any

468
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
other student or teacher with fcps right

469
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
that sounds like a legitimate term now

470
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,759
i might bring in some other

471
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
issues here

472
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
but

473
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
other the current process that they have

474
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
and most people wouldn't object to us is

475
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
that you know this is already in use in

476
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,959
other colleges and used in schools

477
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,560
throughout the country and for example

478
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
the use of social sentinel but there's

479
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
some key differences

480
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,800
current social media programs do not

481
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
access your private social media

482
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
accounts

483
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
they only look at private social media

484
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
which can be seen by anyone at any time

485
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,079
and they're not for use as an

486
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,959
investigative tool

487
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,839
now our school board um

488
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
they're some of the practices that

489
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
they've had that have resulted in well

490
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,279
some of the behavior that they've

491
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
resulted in i mentioned that they

492
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
associate with activists at doc students

493
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
but when other actions that they have

494
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
taken over recent years like for example

495
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
if you look at loudoun county

496
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,480
where before you could have like social

497
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
you'd have public comment commentary at

498
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,759
a school board meeting you can speak for

499
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
three minutes you can come every school

500
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
board meeting right most of us are

501
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
familiar with that latin county they

502
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,399
kind of reduce that they reduce it from

503
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,920
three minutes to one minute instead of

504
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
the camera being on your face it's now

505
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
towards the back of your head

506
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
they also have the presence of private

507
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
security the so the sheriff's office

508
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,800
will have nothing to do with it because

509
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
they realize they're just trying to

510
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
intimidate parents but they'll have you

511
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
walk through metal detectors if you're

512
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
going through rikers island i mean it's

513
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
like it's kind of ridiculous most of

514
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
these people are are professionals and

515
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,439
they're there's there's they don't even

516
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,679
meet the definition of a true threat

517
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
um fairfax county they reduce it from

518
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,799
three minutes to two minutes and the

519
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,880
same thing back of your head um they're

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,839
not going to let you talk if you're

521
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,039
criticizing um anything that you're

522
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
talking about for example um

523
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
they're the most recent would be

524
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,280
um a controversial policy uh position

525
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,480
that they have

526
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,919
before it was if you're going to talk

527
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,360
about a controversial issue you have to

528
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
talk about a neutral and objective

529
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
manner and you have to present both

530
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,559
sides which sounds reasonable i think

531
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,480
most of us would agree with that because

532
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
you know you have to have an idea that

533
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
has to fight for in the marketplace of

534
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
ideas

535
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
but our school board decided uh that

536
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
what they wanted to do was to be to just

537
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
do away with that and allow issues to be

538
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
framed where you have certain things

539
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
that they believe there should be

540
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
non-controversial which

541
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,480
dealing with race or

542
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
for whatever reason they thought what

543
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
wasn't going to be controversial and

544
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
they would basically say they're going

545
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
to have one side and a lot of parents

546
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
are fighting backing at this and may i

547
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,919
remind you

548
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,000
that some of these people have been done

549
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
such an incompetent job uh within office

550
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
that when they start purging people from

551
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
their own democratic party

552
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
uh people are gonna start looking for

553
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
alternatives which is why you're seeing

554
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
what's happened in northern virginia why

555
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
why what happened in virginia happened

556
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
um particularly if you look at like uh

557
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,039
yunkan's election most of those people

558
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
were basically people that got kicked

559
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
out of the open democratic party

560
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,880
um

561
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
the proposed use that they're having

562
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
because of the increasing criticism that

563
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
we've seen is that they now want to

564
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
create and hire a vendor that actually

565
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
has no limits on data collection or

566
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,799
searches

567
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,200
anyone see an issue with that

568
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,320
yeah

569
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,160
or how about deek scams on dark web

570
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,559
searches

571
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,919
what that means that means that

572
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,280
basically

573
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
well 90 a lot of the data 90 of your

574
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,799
intelligence is unclassified and you can

575
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,240
find a lot of people when you find stuff

576
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
that's not publicly available on open

577
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,520
web searches

578
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,760
so you can hire you can pay for a

579
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,919
service you can find out uh

580
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,799
metadata you should be used to crawling

581
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,559
for metadata when you're trying to find

582
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,640
find information about somebody

583
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
use of all source data is that the

584
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,120
question or is it

585
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
okay all source data intelligence means

586
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
any type of source of information so and

587
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
i'll go into this for example what

588
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
information is your child reporting to

589
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
you

590
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,280
is reporting to the teacher

591
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
there have been cases in fairfax county

592
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,280
where a child has complained about their

593
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
parents getting on their case about

594
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
doing their homework and a teacher going

595
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,480
ahead and reporting to child protective

596
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
services that there's homework pressure

597
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
and they visit and they visit their

598
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
house so there's also like a culture war

599
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,559
going on in fairfax county

600
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
particularly on the asian community

601
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
which typically

602
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,480
fairfax are a little extra when it comes

603
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
to education like a lot of people nobody

604
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
moves to fairfax they love the weather

605
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,520
that just doesn't happen right because

606
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
traffic is

607
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
like our traffic is worse than yours

608
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
like this is bad like we're only we

609
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
compete with la for traffic

610
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,000
um

611
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
all source data could also be what what

612
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
could be we could be reported from other

613
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
parents the problem is that because

614
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
they're developing this capability and

615
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
they're immature they don't vet their

616
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,919
sources and they're not adhering to any

617
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
type of oversight which the intelligence

618
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
community certainly has to do and has

619
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,799
been held to account during the church

620
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,520
and pike committees

621
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,919
um so this kind of goes into some of

622
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,640
these uh abuses of power um warrantless

623
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,679
wiretapping we've seen since 911

624
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,120
you've seen growing survey growing

625
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,039
surveillance society such as the inves

626
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,280
fbi's investigative data warehouse

627
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
the patriot act

628
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
the real id the no fly list which is

629
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
still a problem you can easily get on

630
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,640
that list but hard to get off you

631
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
wouldn't get vetted

632
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
you know everyone familiar some some of

633
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,919
these seem familiar

634
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
uh and number six uh we can talk about

635
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
the attacks on academic freedom

636
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
so this kind of goes like through a

637
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,679
history here we look at this rfp i'm

638
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
just looking at my time

639
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,880
you can see up here the church and pike

640
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,960
committees

641
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,400
mccarthyism they wanted to go after um

642
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,120
suspected uh subversives communist

643
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,919
cia during the nixon era and under bush

644
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
administration but the surveillance date

645
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,440
grew

646
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,559
exponentially within this country and

647
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
it's been leveraged by

648
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,520
subsequent administrations since

649
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
so let's talk about this rfp and why

650
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,559
should you be scared about this i

651
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
mentioned that fairfax fairfax county

652
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,120
can serve as a testbed with other school

653
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,919
districts around the country can use

654
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
so this rfp and i actually published an

655
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
article about this i'll show you the

656
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
impact that it's had

657
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
the first one it goes through all

658
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
actually i'll back up here this rfp

659
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
literally goes through all five steps of

660
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
the intelligence collection process from

661
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
planning direction collection

662
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
processing and exploitation analysis and

663
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
production which is where the real

664
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,320
subject of abuse could happen in

665
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,760
dissemination

666
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
the speaker before me had mentioned

667
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
before that humans can understand a

668
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
narrative but however if you politicize

669
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
intelligence or if you start layering if

670
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
you are having biases such as layering

671
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
mirror imaging or hurting type of bias

672
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,039
really bad things can happen

673
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,799
particularly on who you share that that

674
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,840
analysis with because it's your support

675
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,360
you're saying that you're supported with

676
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
data

677
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
uh in step one we talked about with

678
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
planning directions where vendors have

679
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
to show the ability to define assets

680
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,919
such as persons

681
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
brands facilities and products

682
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,240
and when they talk about a brand this

683
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
can be anything from groups facilities

684
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
to students to the school district's

685
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
reputation

686
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
and name let me tell you how ridiculous

687
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
this how absurd this is if you're in the

688
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
intelligence community like if you're in

689
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,000
law enforcement what's the threshold

690
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
before you can collect on a target right

691
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
probable cause

692
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
you have to have probable cause to start

693
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
collecting what's what's the threshold

694
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,159
in the intelligence committee which is a

695
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,320
much lower threshold

696
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
it just has to abide by your mission the

697
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,799
only thing that really gets you in

698
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,240
trouble is if you collect on a u.s

699
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,360
person

700
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,840
or a five-i citizen or a person who's a

701
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
green card holder or in the u or in the

702
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,039
united states

703
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
and because if you start doing that you

704
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
better be able to tie it directly to

705
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,440
whatever mission you're trying to do if

706
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
you're doing some counter terrorism

707
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
support

708
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
it has to tie to that you can you can

709
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,520
only keep it for a specified period of

710
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
time and you can't have a record

711
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
collection where you can refer to it

712
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
back again

713
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,919
if it's a brand

714
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,760
that's a lot of it is a political

715
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,200
initiative

716
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,559
now

717
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,159
fairfax i mean most people could

718
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,840
probably agree with some political

719
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
initiatives but

720
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,559
what happens if you go to other areas of

721
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,640
the country right you know think like

722
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,039
texas oklahoma

723
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,120
you know that it can get it can get

724
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
pretty mississippi it could be this

725
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
could this could get this could get

726
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,919
abused

727
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,799
um

728
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,080
the protecting the ban include

729
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
initiatives

730
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
agendas and information that could

731
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,880
embarrass fcps or school board members

732
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
this is why you have whistleblowing

733
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,880
you're not supposed to classify

734
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,559
information just because it can cause

735
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,559
embarrassment that's why you actually

736
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,320
that's i mean i think we all agree on

737
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,279
that

738
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,240
so if you have something that's

739
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
embarrassing to a school board member

740
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
because it's complete incompetence they

741
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
want actually to know about it

742
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,559
um the vendors could build indicators

743
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,919
and warnings now actually i have

744
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
actually i've actually worked in inw and

745
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
the pentagon

746
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
so

747
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
intelligence is working must be able to

748
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
save queries and set alerts for active

749
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
listening so interaction with your

750
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
targets

751
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
with collection to have the ability to

752
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
scan deep and dark web sources not

753
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,720
visible through traditional web searches

754
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,880
such as ocean

755
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,960
seem like a privacy violation this is

756
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
actually happening it's going on right

757
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,600
now

758
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
uh calls for the ability to collect data

759
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
beyond what is voluntarily provided

760
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,320
so when i'm an attache and i'm when i

761
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
was in morocco everyone knew that all of

762
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
us were intelligence officers and what

763
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
they provided to us they knew they were

764
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
providing that freely to the government

765
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,840
now if you're going between overt or

766
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
what's not voluntary you're now dealing

767
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,600
with was known as covert collection not

768
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,279
clandestine but covert you're not

769
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,760
identifying your identity of what you're

770
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
collecting

771
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
over collection could be the crawling of

772
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
social media platforms email addresses

773
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
association information with aliases to

774
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
identify individuals dealing with

775
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,600
social notable network analysis

776
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
identifying your relationships with

777
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,080
other individuals find essentially they

778
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
want to know which parents are

779
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
complaining about them the most and

780
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
identifying their true person their

781
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
cyber personas and associated with true

782
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
name

783
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,360
um also we feel integration with the fcp

784
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,679
with our student information system

785
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,960
this is the information that your

786
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,799
student is available in your student

787
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,159
whether if they have whatever

788
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,799
disciplinary records and even using your

789
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
your own kid as a collector against you

790
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
if they're reporting something

791
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
and oh this is this is this what gets me

792
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,240
this would scare mostly all of you the

793
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
vendor's free to use any data source

794
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,000
anonymously

795
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
and that goes actually that directly

796
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
goes to covert collection

797
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,679
so if you use like for example a company

798
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,159
like let's say palantir anyone further

799
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,760
palantir

800
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
you've heard of pallets here right they

801
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
use like their own proprietary software

802
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
methods they have a

803
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
it's kind of almost like starlight you

804
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
know like on steroids i mean they're

805
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
able to basically to use and scrape uh

806
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,120
unstructured data improve and create

807
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
through uh visual images and so for

808
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,640
associations

809
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,600
and if you're using any data source how

810
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,279
can you challenge as a parent who they

811
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,320
should on who they share this

812
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
information with and let me remind you a

813
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
lot of our school board members actually

814
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
have and work with like activists that

815
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,840
support whatever agenda that they have

816
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
we can talk about the exploitation where

817
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,159
you talk about false reduction rate with

818
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,159
embedded violence

819
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,600
this has tried to establish true names

820
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
rather than cyber personas so they're

821
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
not really doing anything to

822
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
vet the accuracy of what's being

823
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,039
reported

824
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,480
for example when you deal with the

825
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,600
intelligence committee we deal with

826
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
what's known as an iir an intelligence

827
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,760
information report it's unvetted

828
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,039
intelligence

829
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,240
whenever you have a source you're

830
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
supposed to vet and validate that source

831
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
for its accuracy and you're supposed to

832
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
use all source from multiple methods to

833
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,399
validate what you're to to support your

834
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,600
assessment it's a crystal ball

835
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
intelligence is never perfect this is

836
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
another problem like they're not being

837
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
perfect with this with with this process

838
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
with this product

839
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,320
and their analysis and production this

840
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,000
is to visually identify relationships

841
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
and connections between persons this is

842
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
all within the request for proposal and

843
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
the ability to have a customizable

844
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
report on a disparate data seat multiple

845
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
origin points to produce a high level

846
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,279
summary and the ability to provide a

847
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,440
customer report to disparate data set

848
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
with multiple origin points to produce a

849
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
high level summary

850
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,159
this allows them for example of

851
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,640
potential abuses that if you are

852
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
politicizing a particular parent that

853
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
you really don't like

854
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,399
you can put together basically a human

855
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,159
targeting package and you can present it

856
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,600
to you whatever your local law

857
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,200
enforcement and then see what actions

858
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,440
what actionable uh what for them to take

859
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,279
action on it

860
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
potential for abuse absolutely

861
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
particularly if you're not having if it

862
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
doesn't adhere to any type of analytic

863
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
standards it's not a subject any type of

864
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
oversight

865
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
um this kind of helps with my other

866
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,200
potential abuses um who's reported how

867
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
is it presented

868
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
does it meet intelligence community

869
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
directive 203 analytic standards

870
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,159
compliant probably not

871
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,200
you know if you're in the intelligence

872
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,039
community it takes about eight years to

873
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
become a subject matter expert to be a

874
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
competent analyst to know actually

875
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,000
subject matter now you're just going to

876
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,840
throw this open source capability in the

877
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,039
school districts because you're not

878
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,480
liking the criticism you're seeing from

879
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
parents

880
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
and just to help you

881
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
kind of a

882
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
going back like for example in loudoun

883
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
county that earlier uh photo that i

884
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
showed they actually had a school

885
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
district where school district officials

886
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
were on a secret facebook site

887
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
collecting information on parents that

888
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
were criticizing them

889
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
one was a gym teacher that spoke out you

890
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,799
know they had criticized whatever

891
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,399
transgender thing

892
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,840
just you know people exercising their

893
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
first amendment rights

894
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,919
um and then you had the september 21st

895
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
uh national school board association

896
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,760
where um they wanted to invoke the

897
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
patriot act against parents

898
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,559
now that

899
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,320
was interesting like i am on the ground

900
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
level at the time i'm working in

901
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,320
quantico i'm directly supporting the

902
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
chief security officer

903
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
i quickly i immediately self-reported

904
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
that one i said guys i'm gonna be

905
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,440
showing up on this one you think that

906
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,799
that was scary

907
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
like if you look at that memo it

908
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,480
directed the fbi to set up a special

909
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,640
task force to work with law enforcement

910
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
and to set up dedicated architectures to

911
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,720
actually look into these threats

912
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
now mind you there was absolutely no

913
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
reporting on actually a true threat

914
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,159
that would merit a national capability

915
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,760
certainly none that would ever exceed

916
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,039
the capabilities of what local law

917
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,679
enforcement would happen

918
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
well i mean he got a letter from the

919
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,840
national school board association

920
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
merrick garland decided to write a

921
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,559
letter

922
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,320
you know and also remember merrick

923
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
garland's son-in-law also runs panorama

924
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
education so like there's there's a

925
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
bunny connection there too

926
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,279
but

927
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,720
you know there was the outrage from

928
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
parents when that happened and you saw a

929
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,559
lot of states immediately separate

930
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,918
themselves from the nbsa

931
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,399
if you're what fragile none

932
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,000
absolutely no federal law that you're

933
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
breaking what's that

934
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,760
they don't need a law they can do what

935
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,840
they want because nobody's got the balls

936
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,600
to challenge them except

937
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,440
well no there's a lot of parents like

938
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
they they really up in dc like

939
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,600
they

940
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,840
well they picked a fight with like

941
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
parents like i said like so many of us

942
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,600
are like in the ic and law enforcement

943
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,279
and dod communities like we're not

944
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,640
taking this

945
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
you know and like and then when you kick

946
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
us out like we move there because one is

947
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,000
diverse two the school district's really

948
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,679
good and it's like we started seeing

949
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,279
this kind of crap go on like most of us

950
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
have been in like in areas and in high

951
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,960
threatened a lot of us have been in

952
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,399
countries in high threat environments

953
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,679
and we kind of recognize this type of

954
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,440
behavior so we're i mean we're going to

955
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
we're going to start giving it back

956
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
um

957
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,200
so this kind of goes into like this

958
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
slide like how most of us felt like

959
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
mostly all of us like we were really

960
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,039
happy we were comfortable this is why we

961
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,399
moved to fairfax

962
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,760
right and things like kind of like

963
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,279
change like the last two years we're

964
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,399
just kind of like

965
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
all right this is this has gone to this

966
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
has gone on far enough

967
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,039
uh this has happened in other areas of

968
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,120
the country like in michigan

969
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
uh you had michigan school board members

970
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
that were having uh collecting dossiers

971
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,480
on parents

972
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,519
um

973
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,279
and this one this one from michigan this

974
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,640
was when they were monitoring the social

975
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,360
media accounts of parents i'm sorry

976
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,039
arizona was when they were collecting

977
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,640
dossiers on parents

978
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
can you imagine sending your kids to

979
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,200
school and you have a question all of a

980
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
sudden you're finding out that your name

981
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,399
is you're being in a database

982
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,080
they're collecting it on you

983
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,360
it's not just one kid what if you have

984
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,880
multiple kids how many have more than

985
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,600
one kid in the school system

986
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,880
yeah they're collecting a lot of

987
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
information about you

988
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
when this is coming when this is coming

989
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,000
through

990
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
um

991
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960
so with the takeaways

992
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,159
um

993
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,679
anybody with this capability could be

994
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,080
deemed a threat to the brand

995
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,159
so if you're a mouthy parent at a pta

996
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,600
meeting

997
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,039
and they

998
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,679
will come after you at pta meetings uh

999
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,000
can be subject to an apparatus that's

1000
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
supported by you know a billion dollar

1001
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
war chest

1002
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,120
uh we talked about the nbsa we talked

1003
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,720
about mentioned before the loudoun

1004
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
county

1005
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,240
within schools across the country other

1006
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
school districts that use social media

1007
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,519
monitoring however it hasn't been

1008
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,200
modified to

1009
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
expand the collection capability beyond

1010
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,039
students

1011
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,960
some other issues dealing with if you do

1012
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
have this apparatus how secure is the

1013
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
system really we talk about some of the

1014
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
cyber security instances in 2016 within

1015
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
the us

1016
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,679
on the average is about two school

1017
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,760
districts every day or popped with like

1018
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,399
ransomware or some other incident

1019
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,559
when i did a foia on at my local school

1020
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,000
board i found out that one they don't

1021
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,840
have a log retention policy

1022
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,360
they don't have an encryption of data at

1023
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,080
rest or in transit policy uh again like

1024
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,519
working in the federal government like

1025
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,960
some of us there was a speaker earlier

1026
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,200
at this conference about executive order

1027
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
uh 14028

1028
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,039
which is having a huge impact

1029
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,760
um there is hope we have the uh

1030
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
children's online privacy protection

1031
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,799
rule or how they're going to be

1032
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,279
protecting this type of information

1033
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,480
prohibitions against mandatory

1034
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,600
collection

1035
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,000
user prohibitions retention and security

1036
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,760
and well i'm going to have actually time

1037
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
here to answer about questions for 10

1038
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,760
minutes so i did actually blow the

1039
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
whistle on this one i actually did

1040
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,120
publish

1041
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,880
this article on my findings back in

1042
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,039
march

1043
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,799
and an update and how this had an impact

1044
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,440
is that they pulled the rfp

1045
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
they pulled the requested proposal and

1046
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,560
then they republished it but when they

1047
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
republish it they didn't put any details

1048
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,879
as to what they want to use

1049
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,879
as what they want requesting from

1050
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,480
vendors

1051
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,399
um i mentioned before he said like who's

1052
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,800
got the balls to fight these people so

1053
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,359
um like i'm a group of a lot of pissed

1054
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,639
off parents

1055
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
and what we ended up doing we ended up

1056
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,679
creating our own shadow board

1057
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,359
so think of this like his mystery

1058
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,399
science theater 3000

1059
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,239
where we actually stream our school

1060
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,399
board meetings and we actually if we get

1061
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,560
we get reports from other teachers

1062
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
and other parents

1063
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,960
and we we are putting them on blast

1064
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
like it is it is raw and we have like in

1065
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
this one we keep uh we keep a zoom

1066
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
meeting we allow everyone to come i mean

1067
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,199
if you're gonna start limiting comment

1068
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,079
and we this idea exploded when one of

1069
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,200
our school board members said we're

1070
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,880
gonna eliminate public comment because

1071
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
it's not conducive to our agenda and

1072
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
we're just like oh i know

1073
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,079
i hear you once we heard that we're like

1074
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,000
not happening today buddy

1075
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,040
um so we just we launched this and

1076
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,560
even on our second episode we actually

1077
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
have four times as many views in the

1078
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
actual school board stream

1079
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,480
so

1080
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
yeah it's it's it's interesting down in

1081
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
uh what's going on

1082
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
uh in virginia here's my contact

1083
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
information you know i've got a gmail

1084
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
i'm pretty open to social if people want

1085
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,680
to contact me

1086
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,359
so i'll leave some of this open for

1087
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,720
questions somebody's got a question

1088
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,160
about

1089
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,839
what's going on down there and elsewhere

1090
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,000
yes sir

1091
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,480
yes they are

1092
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
um

1093
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
well that's a great question are we

1094
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
looking at higher levels well right now

1095
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,240
i've got a 15 14 year old and 16 year

1096
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,240
old which is i guess why i drink but um

1097
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,320
but we are looking to expand we actually

1098
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
are helping other parents set up their

1099
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,280
own shadow boards to understand what

1100
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
their school board members are doing and

1101
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,720
you're right um

1102
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
most of these are the lowest level

1103
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520
officials and

1104
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,599
that's unfortunate because in my view

1105
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,280
like the school board of school board

1106
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
races are probably the most important

1107
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,079
because they're impacting your students

1108
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
lives

1109
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,560
um

1110
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,160
we're in this case like we're not giving

1111
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
them any place to hide we actually have

1112
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,440
like retiree and volunteers actually

1113
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,960
showing up the working session work

1114
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,440
session meetings we actually so we can

1115
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
actually hear in real time what what

1116
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,119
their pro what they're thinking and

1117
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,640
they're what's

1118
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,160
and the matters are integral to the

1119
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,000
decision-making process

1120
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
and for those like for fairfax it might

1121
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,680
be like like also in the similar other

1122
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,200
school districts a school board member

1123
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
if more than two of them meet they

1124
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,599
actually have to call them meetings so

1125
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,119
they can't just meet in secret when they

1126
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
talk when they talk about their yeah

1127
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
they're not liking this and this and we

1128
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,760
actually had an impact on the last

1129
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,800
school board meeting because they

1130
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,480
weren't expecting

1131
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
we had an older gentleman who's retired

1132
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
he's like hey i got all the time in the

1133
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
world what do you want me to do and

1134
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,839
we're like we want you to go to their

1135
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
all their their retreat all their their

1136
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
uh their offsite their retreat as well

1137
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,040
as their school as well as their um

1138
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,079
their work session now before this year

1139
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,760
they used to actually put the recordings

1140
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
of their work sessions and then because

1141
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
like a lot of they're getting a lot of

1142
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
heat they decided to no longer do that

1143
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,800
and just publish minutes and we're like

1144
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,160
okay are these minutes really like

1145
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
accurate so like why don't you show up

1146
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,560
there

1147
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,960
and uh he did the gentleman's name is

1148
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,359
mark and they wanted to push in like an

1149
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,240
incident a bias incident accountability

1150
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,440
program

1151
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,880
which you're kind of like what does that

1152
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,119
mean what's very generic is overly broad

1153
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,560
and vague of like how you can report

1154
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
like any type of instance of a

1155
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
microaggression or a bias

1156
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
but you're like okay well is there like

1157
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,200
any type of reasonable person standard

1158
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
or is there any type of compelling

1159
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
interest and like they really couldn't

1160
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,839
articulate that

1161
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,040
i hope that answers your question yes

1162
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,720
correct

1163
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
okay

1164
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,079
that's that's that's horrible that's

1165
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,760
what that's why you have these programs

1166
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
that are out there to identify that and

1167
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,359
to intervene

1168
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,560
well i'm not criticizing the intent

1169
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,200
between identifying mental distress or

1170
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,520
violent behavior what i'm criticizing is

1171
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,040
the expansion

1172
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
to the word brand

1173
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
before

1174
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
cf problematic we weren't talking about

1175
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,720
like

1176
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,680
harm

1177
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,880
bullying

1178
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,680
uh or aggressions towards uh or any type

1179
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,160
of demographic or group like that's not

1180
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,240
even on the table like everyone agrees

1181
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
with that in a venn diagram we're

1182
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,359
talking about like once you start

1183
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,280
talking about a brand image or now you

1184
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,599
no longer have an or even a process in

1185
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,839
place of analytic standards if you have

1186
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,960
a problem with a parent because some

1187
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
parents get problematic

1188
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,119
um and you have no means for how you're

1189
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,240
going to share the information who do

1190
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
you share the information with how long

1191
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,520
do you retain that information for

1192
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
example if you're a parent

1193
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
who has multiple children with the

1194
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
school system you can collect a lot of

1195
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,839
information on that parent and parents

1196
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,680
have gotten harassed where

1197
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,119
even like at our school board meetings

1198
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,720
like we've had parents who have had

1199
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
who've been threatened who've been

1200
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
assaulted

1201
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
who have had their cars egged i mean

1202
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,000
i've mentioned about being docks

1203
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,160
it's getting to that level in virginia

1204
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
oh yeah i'm i'm running for school board

1205
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,480
in my area like i'm getting rid of these

1206
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,800
people like they gotta go

1207
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
i mean that's what we're doing we're

1208
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
we're just we're gonna run for school

1209
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,119
board and just and take their seats

1210
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,720
because you should never get to that

1211
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,160
level yes

1212
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
one or the other so it's interesting in

1213
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
fairfax like it's a soup right so

1214
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
everyone who's fighting against them

1215
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,520
they just want to label us all everyone

1216
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
is like right wing that's that's the

1217
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
immediate label but then you're kind of

1218
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
like no

1219
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,680
that's not the case

1220
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,920
most of us are are having a real problem

1221
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,160
with um

1222
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
uh

1223
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
like for example like parental

1224
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,960
notification right they're like like a

1225
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
lot of policies

1226
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
something could happen with your kid

1227
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,599
they're not even gonna notify you

1228
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,000
and that that's that's a big problem

1229
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,359
i mean that's you know there's there's

1230
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,119
an issue with parental rights

1231
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,079
um so

1232
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,280
that's what's bringing everyone to part

1233
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,720
now this is the fight that's bringing

1234
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,920
everyone together now there might be

1235
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,520
other issues that will the group will

1236
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,040
splinter and that's likely going to

1237
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,160
happen but

1238
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,440
in this one the behavior with some of

1239
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,640
these school board members where they're

1240
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
trying to go up go after parents and

1241
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,079
harassing parents that's just not a

1242
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,880
working strategy

1243
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,599
yes how do you find out what your school

1244
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,040
board is doing

1245
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
oh foyas

1246
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,839
foia foia foia

1247
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,640
um

1248
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,760
and some of them will actually complain

1249
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,359
about foyas um

1250
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,960
but you know you can foia another

1251
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
person's foia as well

1252
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,280
so yeah

1253
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,280
yes

1254
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,520
no pta is a different organization um

1255
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,480
so uh if it's a well a pizza first of

1256
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
all you gotta understand like a pta

1257
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,000
really is kind of powerless right

1258
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,200
they're kind of like you know you're

1259
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
supposed to be doing like your bake

1260
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
sales coordinating volunteering for your

1261
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
parents they're supposed to allow for

1262
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
advocacy for parents though they will

1263
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,760
they will actively try to suppress that

1264
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
in some cases if you

1265
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,800
what's that

1266
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,599
it is

1267
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,560
dude

1268
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,200
google my name google google me like i

1269
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,280
was like with the war i got into with

1270
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,920
the virginia pta dude like yeah it is

1271
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,520
controlled opposition there's a reason

1272
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
why there's that t in there you can't

1273
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960
you can't take a position that's uh

1274
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
that's contrary to any uh published

1275
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,200
position paper that they have

1276
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,599
um as far as a con techniques that you

1277
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,160
can use if it's a virginia pta member

1278
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,000
you would foil the the emails of the

1279
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,680
school board member and if they had a

1280
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,599
communication with a

1281
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
pta official

1282
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
that's how you typically would find it

1283
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,240
yes

1284
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
absolutely that's that's why we're

1285
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,359
that's why we're actually going to have

1286
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,960
we're actually put up a schedule where

1287
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,800
we're going to be rotating and showing

1288
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,560
up at all their work session meetings so

1289
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,079
like when they want to have like a the

1290
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,920
bad idea fairy show up like there's

1291
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,160
going to be a rally outside the school

1292
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,200
board they're going to they're going to

1293
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,359
see it happen like this is just like you

1294
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,960
know think about like all these school

1295
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,079
board meetings like it literally has

1296
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,480
become like protest rally like i've

1297
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,359
never

1298
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,960
you know like i'm in my 40s like i would

1299
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
never see this in like unless like i was

1300
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,000
in college or something like that

1301
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
any other

1302
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,560
what do you

1303
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,160
generally think to the idea of doing any

1304
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,359
kind of

1305
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,680
programmatic social media surveillance

1306
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,760
even if it's in the name of trying to

1307
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,160
identify potential threats and all that

1308
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,800
jazz i guess i'm just curious what you

1309
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
would

1310
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,520
what the value is of having those

1311
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,440
automated systems there

1312
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,480
versus

1313
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,839
just making sure that you have the

1314
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,520
capacity and the ability to do

1315
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,000
retroactive like if someone makes an act

1316
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
like i was bullied by this person on

1317
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,280
twitter and they made threats against me

1318
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,400
on twitter

1319
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,240
um having the ability to just go ahead

1320
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,839
and archive those tweets versus having

1321
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,079
to bought scraping social media

1322
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,079
proactively i don't see the need for

1323
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,400
that second one

1324
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,640
no i i would agree with you if you're

1325
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
having somebody who's being threatened i

1326
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
mean you should be able to look at it uh

1327
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
be able to perform like if it is like a

1328
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
true like a bias incident because that

1329
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
that would certainly like escalate like

1330
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,720
how you would respond to that or

1331
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
remediate that issue

1332
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,359
um but yeah but in this case this is

1333
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,960
actually like trying to control your

1334
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,280
opposition or criticism like this is and

1335
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
under the guise of like we're trying to

1336
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,280
protect kids but we're really trying to

1337
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,440
like you know keep parents in check

1338
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,359
that's kind of that's that's that i'm

1339
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,799
hoping that's the takeaway yes

1340
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
right

1341
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,640
okay well okay i'll i'll bring that up

1342
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,760
um

1343
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,839
this is a sensitive topic but for

1344
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,839
example in kindergarten if you're if

1345
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,000
your child wants to change your gender

1346
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,200
identity they're not they're not going

1347
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
to notify the parents in kindergarten

1348
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,480
and that's in training material i think

1349
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
most parents would want to know if their

1350
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,040
child is going through some sort of

1351
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,880
identity crisis or if they're having

1352
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,160
gender fluidity they wouldn't want to

1353
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,280
intervene they would want to be what

1354
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
they would want to be there or most

1355
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,880
parents would want to support

1356
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,000
now they're you're going to have the

1357
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
one-offs where some parents aren't

1358
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,800
supportive and that should be handled on

1359
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,640
an individual basis right but

1360
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,359
well

1361
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,240
then you

1362
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,640
then you do you handle that right if

1363
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,880
it's abusive right that you you you

1364
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,560
handle that appropriately but

1365
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,000
does the policy work if you're just

1366
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,359
going to say for across the board you're

1367
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,880
not going to not going to involve the

1368
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,319
parent because you do have some parents

1369
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,440
that are going to even intervene and

1370
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,079
support their children so so why

1371
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,680
wouldn't you bring in

1372
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,520
those people than the support network it

1373
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,319
takes a village to raise a child

1374
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,760
okay

1375
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,839
what you mentioned very early on

1376
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,000
oh sorry oh sorry wait what one more

1377
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,079
question yeah

1378
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,079
okay

1379
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,040
so that's coming from if you're using

1380
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,640
like your school assets or computers to

1381
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,560
do like inappropriate usage like you

1382
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
know if you're using it for like porn or

1383
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,920
furtherance of crime

1384
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,280
that's you're supposed to have some

1385
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,240
accountability for that

1386
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,960
um

1387
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
absolutely

1388
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
the parents should be treated as like a

1389
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,480
hostile actor these would be their own

1390
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,760
child and that the school board could as

1391
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,599
a generally

1392
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,319
intermediate and

1393
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,359
you know potentially

1394
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,119
discourage communication from the child

1395
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,040
back to parent we're saying we the

1396
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
school board need to our role is

1397
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,680
protecting children from their parents

1398
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,720
that to me as a parent is

1399
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,879
a

1400
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
you know i should be considered that

1401
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,599
parents

1402
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,119
are threats to their own children

1403
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,359
whereas some sort of benevolent

1404
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,400
government agency knows what's best so

1405
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,839
so

1406
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,520
and that's and that's why you have this

1407
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,119
war that's going on right because you're

1408
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,720
you're creating a lot of distress on

1409
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,599
parents

1410
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,040
nobody wants to be able to send their

1411
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,480
kids to a school where they can have

1412
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
where they don't know what's going on

1413
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,119
like that's just not gonna it it's

1414
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,800
creating that creates conflict yes sir

1415
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,960
um

1416
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,160
i i am with you on that i i'm all for a

1417
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,839
web portal that you don't have to foia

1418
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,839
that's searchable regarding school

1419
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,400
policies as well as other foias

1420
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,440
so i'm not even i'm i am all for that

1421
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,359
like yeah if someone has other put that

1422
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,800
on a portal where if you want to see

1423
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,400
what other people avoid you can view

1424
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,040
that yes

1425
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,359
of sir and all these

1426
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,520
racist and sexist

1427
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,880
indoctrination

1428
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,359
programs that we we read about not

1429
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,200
generally but enough that is a problem

1430
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,960
between the teachers doing

1431
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,200
they do they do and yeah i got two

1432
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,839
minutes uh yeah i'm to wrap up here um

1433
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,599
yeah when you look at like the randy

1434
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,760
guard going that's a great question um

1435
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,319
it it is and and i would say it's it's

1436
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,680
they don't even support teachers they

1437
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,359
support administrators i mean if you

1438
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,319
look at a lot of school districts

1439
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,760
they're hiring a lot more administrators

1440
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,680
not teachers yeah

1441
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,599
and uh there and a lot of it's pushing

1442
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,040
initiatives because it's avoiding

1443
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,839
accountability um but yeah i would say

1444
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,400
there certainly is um well i'm gonna

1445
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,680
wrap up here i'm going to respect the

1446
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,400
time

1447
