no

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,880

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
all right all right hello again everyone

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680

the big auditorium

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
volunteers if you want to volunteer talk

26
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
to info desk or security we can always

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
use more volunteer help and late night

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
content begins at 9 30 in half an hour

29
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
which you might oh you'll just make

30
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,040
right no you're going to miss the first

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,079
part of it

32
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
so if you can and you're interested go

33
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,840
up and see it in room 406 fourth floor

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
of the video room and with that next

35
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
talk is just enough rdd cloning to be

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
dangerous with gabe skyler so take it

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,440
away gabe thank you all right

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
here we go

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
thank you die hards for uh sticking

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,440
around um all right let's add to the

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
delinquency of some mostly majors i hope

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
um all right so

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
this is my talk enough rfid cloning to

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
be dangerous um the point here is really

45
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,319
that

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,120
i

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
had kind of a need and i needed to clone

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,319
a tag and so i

49
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,599
figured it out

50
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
and it's not that scary really the

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
upshot of the whole thing is that we all

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
as you know elite hackers we we know

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
that tags are really easy to copy but

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,599
like can you actually do it i don't know

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,480
um so i'm going to give you enough to

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
know that you actually can pretty much

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,519
copy most things

58
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
um i mean there's some cool stuff you

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
can't but it's also really cool to tell

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
your friends hey maybe i can copy that

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
oh

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,879
awesome you have really good security

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,640
so here's me

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
um in a bit of a nutshell

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
i do hail from austin texas yippie kaye

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
um i've been in ops forever

67
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,519
ages

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
and i'm pretty new to cyber security so

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
i've been hacking for a long time

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
but i'm actually officially in cyber

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
security now

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
on my spare time

73
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
other i'd like to go running but i also

74
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
like tinkering with junk

75
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
picking locks i'm not that good at it

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
and i really do think that our

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
technology should be used for social

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
change uh and i think that's the really

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
wonderful thing about this conference is

80
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,760
that i think that's what we're all here

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,959
for

82
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,159
so let's get into it

83
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
here's how i got here

84
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,879
um

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,360
i ride a motorcycle

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,239
my

87
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
building requires an rfid tag to get

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
into the garage

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
not easy with a motorcycle what i was

90
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,000
doing was i have my hands in gloves i

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
was stopping halfway from the door i was

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
taking off one glove i was fishing out

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
this key the blue guy there

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
stuffing it in the other glove hoping

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
that it would stay there put on the

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
first glove

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
you need both hands clutch is on one

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
side throttles on the other and then of

99
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
course i'm worrying that it's going to

100
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
fall out and then i'm sort of waving the

101
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,520
thing at the reader

102
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
so this is how i got here was that i had

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
a real

104
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
mother of invention which was the

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
necessity of i'm really tired of trying

106
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,040
to do this

107
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
the other thing that i realized while i

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
was putting together this talk is that

109
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
i've actually been really interested in

110
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,199
this stuff for quite a while

111
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
my work takes me to a bunch of places

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
and for years now

113
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
i've been writing down the the the date

114
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,639
how many days the room number that i was

115
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,960
staying in on all of my hotel keys

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
because i figured you know someday i'm

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
going to figure out how those things

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
work

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
and

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
here we are

121
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,199
but it was really it was really the

122
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
motorcycle glove problem that that was

123
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
the thing that got me to do it

124
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
and what's fun is they're two different

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
technologies

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
here's the basics of passive rfid so

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
tags again into a building or get into a

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,960
garage or get into your hotel room or

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
using passive rfid

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
the device itself the card the tag the

131
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
key fob whatever it is

132
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
doesn't have a battery in it so it needs

133
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
to power itself somehow

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,039
and the

135
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,919
simplest metaphor that i found for this

136
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
is that

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
it's similar to imagine you have

138
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
i have a flashlight or

139
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
i'm i i'm operating a lighthouse

140
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,919
and there's a ship out there

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,600
and so i can blink

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,199
a flashlight

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,880
at a regular period

144
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
or i can send morse code out to the ship

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
but i want to be able to tell what the

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
ship is

147
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
is saying back to me

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
well

149
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,919
as long as somebody on the ship has a

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,039
mirror

151
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
they don't need energy

152
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
i mean avoiding the muscle and all that

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
kind of stuff we're all hackers so we'll

154
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
poke a million holes in that but

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
but supposing that that i don't have all

156
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,440
those

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
problems um all i really need is a

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
mirror to reply

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
so the lighthouse can say hey boop boop

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
doop and then as long as it gives me a

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
pulse that's regular

162
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,440
now i can choose whether to show the

163
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
mirror or not

164
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
to return a message so as long as it's

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
just saying boop boop boop boop i can

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,319
say on off off on off on

167
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
so that's how passive rfid works uh in

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,759
the in the simplest of metaphors

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,759
is that it just bounces back the energy

170
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
provided by

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
the reader to communicate back

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,639
there are two major frequencies for

173
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
access keys

174
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,800
for my garage which happens to be low

175
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
frequency

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
and your hotel keys which are high

177
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,000
frequency

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
um they speak on different frequencies

179
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
125 kilohertz pretty low

180
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
30 megahertz pretty high

181
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
and what you'll find is that the lower

182
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
frequency ones are the dumb ones

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
lucky for me that was my garage door was

184
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
that it was dumb

185
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
the high frequency ones are smarter

186
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,919
they can actually do some math they can

187
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
actually deal with cryptography things

188
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,240
like that

189
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
so here's

190
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
a broad characterization of what i found

191
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
about the low frequency ones now i'm

192
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
just a person

193
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
just this guy um and so there are plenty

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,240
of talks about the real details of this

195
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
stuff but in a broad generalization

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
low frequency are these dorkies

197
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
that happens to be mine right there the

198
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,960
blue one that i had to do with the

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
the garage door i actually have it right

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
there

201
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,279
um all it really does is it just replies

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
it just says hey

203
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
i am this serial number

204
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
um the readers really just read the darn

205
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
thing they just say hey

206
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
who are you and it says here's who i am

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,800
similar to a bar code or a mag stripe

208
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
all it does is just returns what it's

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
what its

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
serial number is similar to a

211
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,519
physical key

212
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,320
just returns what its pinning is

213
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
it's very similar

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
what i've found

215
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
which is interesting is that they are

216
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,480
harder to block by those rfid blockers

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
and i'm going to actually

218
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
show that in a little bit

219
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
here's the high frequency higher energy

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120
it can actually these cards can actually

221
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
do some math

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
so they can actually do cryptographic

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,839
routines

224
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
uh they're they're fairly smart

225
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
uh they also

226
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
in my experience i've seen them that

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
they have they have some memory on there

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
so the reader can actually update that

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
so whereas the the low frequency

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
is saying hey here's just my name and my

231
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
number

232
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
um the actual high frequency reader

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
can actually say the card hey i want you

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to have this rolling code for the next

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
time i read you

236
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,399
kind of a very very simple system on a

237
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
chip

238
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
and what i've got here on the picture

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,959
actually

240
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,839
is

241
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,839
the hotel i stayed in about a month ago

242
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,959
um had

243
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
they were kind enough to provide a key

244
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
that was see-through

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,240
and what you can see is a chip

246
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,440
and then the coil that that inducts the

247
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
energy

248
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
so it looks a lot like a credit card

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
doesn't it it's similar

250
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
so these are the smart ones um they are

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,720
easier to block with your rfid

252
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
wallets or whatever the heck you have

253
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
chips every card has a chip

254
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
um so it's not just the loop uh for the

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
radio

256
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
it's also got to do something something

257
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
has to reply and so they all have chips

258
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
and so you'll need to figure out which

259
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
chip

260
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
yours has

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,399
i

262
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,320
10 will get you 20 that if you've got a

263
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
low frequency rfid tag

264
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,600
it it can be emulated by what's called a

265
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
t55

266
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
chip

267
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
and these are

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
really really easy to pick up you can

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
get like a dozen of them for like five

270
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
bucks

271
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,920
the high frequencies are a little

272
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
sneakier

273
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
but

274
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
they they seem to have

275
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,839
pretty standards uh either a hid eye

276
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
class or a myfair classic

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
most of your hotel keys are a myfair

278
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
classic

279
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
um

280
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,920
and your your tools the tools that you

281
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
use for your rfid they're going to tell

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,519
you they're going to figure out what the

283
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
chipset is for you because

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,519
plenty of people amazing people have

285
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
gone before us and have decided to make

286
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
this easy for people made it easy for

287
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
themselves and then open sourced it

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,720
beyond chips chips are are just the the

289
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
frequency

290
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
is then enabling the chip to talk and

291
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
then

292
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
similar to the osi

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399
model

294
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
then there has to be a data format for

295
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
what's being exchanged between the

296
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
reader and the card

297
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
and so you'll need to know the data

298
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
format

299
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
the big one that i've been finding is

300
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
hidde actually was the one that was for

301
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
my garage store

302
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
and these are really just a data format

303
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
so that when the card replies here's my

304
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,480
here's my name or when the card replies

305
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
hey what do you want me to do

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,120
you're speaking the same language

307
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,440
cards come in all sorts of form factors

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
i guess i should say tags come in all

309
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
sorts of form factors

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
and pretty much anything that you can

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
fit a chip into with a coil

312
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,959
can be a card uh can be a tag

313
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,920
so here i've got some examples

314
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
i've got my hotel key i've got another

315
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
key

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
that that card is actually i think

317
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
just like a normal access key for a

318
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
building

319
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
you can inject these things

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
which is actually not that new of an

321
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,160
idea

322
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
people have been injecting these into

323
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,959
their pets

324
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
for quite a while

325
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,560
same technology

326
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,639
it's just a chip with a coil happens to

327
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
be a really small one which happens to

328
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
be difficult to find sometimes

329
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,120
but it's really just a chip with a very

330
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
small coil

331
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,079
when i was when i was trying to solve my

332
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,440
problem of of the the motorcycle

333
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
the motorcycle rider who doesn't want to

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,639
have to like figure out where the heck

335
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
his key is i actually was

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
i was not going to inject it i'm seeing

337
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
some looks i was not i was actually but

338
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
i was going to get an injectable tag

339
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
because they're tiny they're like a

340
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,519
piece of long grain rice and i was

341
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,880
actually going to like

342
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
super glue it or sew it to my gloves

343
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,279
and it would have worked it would have

344
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
worked just fine

345
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
um

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
ended up not doing that in the end

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,880
but

348
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,760
all sorts of form factors for this stuff

349
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,480
stickers are kind of one of my favorites

350
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
they're sort of fun um nfc is an rfid

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
technology and

352
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
obviously you can get stickers for that

353
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
i think everybody's seen those

354
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
so what do you do here i was i

355
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
knew that i had my my little blue key

356
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
i knew that i wanted to do something i

357
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,399
thought i was going to do an injectable

358
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,560
and then sew it onto something

359
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
so what do you do how do you copy these

360
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,920
darn things so i started to do some

361
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,319
research

362
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
here's where i started out

363
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,639
um

364
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,720
you can get

365
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
copiers for basically any format

366
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,079
if you know what kind of chip you want

367
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,839
to copy something onto and you know what

368
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,680
format you can just you can just buy

369
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,720
something

370
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
this thing this little blue thing

371
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
cloner of doom because it sets a

372
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,639
password on the darn thing

373
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,760
um

374
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
this little thing was like 10 bucks and

375
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,920
it came with like five free tags to

376
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,279
write to

377
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
um

378
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,880
super super simple so

379
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
i guess the moral of that story is if

380
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
you just want to copy this stupid thing

381
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
on some other stupid thing

382
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
10 bucks will do it

383
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
you can even get it shipped from from

384
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,519
the united states and it gets there in

385
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
like four days and it has spare tags

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
so

387
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
super super doable um but we're all

388
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,959
hackers so we want to do more than that

389
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,600
we aren't happy with that

390
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
there are also

391
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
tools that will copy numerous formats

392
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,560
icopy x is one of them

393
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
um

394
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
pretty darn closed systems but they can

395
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,759
copy lots of stuff and they have a

396
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,759
little display and it's great

397
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,600
they cost a bunch of money

398
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
three four hundred dollars

399
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
so

400
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
where you end up if you end up in the

401
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
rabbit hole which

402
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
i inevitably did

403
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
where you end up is going with something

404
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
like the prox mark

405
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,120
um if there is one thing you're going to

406
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
write down today prox mark 3 is is the

407
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,519
thing

408
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,920
it's open source

409
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
and it's really a swiss army knife for

410
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
rfid hacking

411
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
it has a low frequency and it has a high

412
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
frequency antenna on it

413
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,160
and

414
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,199
the

415
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,079
firmware is actively maintained

416
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,320
the software that you run on your system

417
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
is actively maintained it can run in a

418
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
standalone mode

419
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
but it's really where you want to end up

420
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
what i ended up with is what's called

421
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,000
the prox mark iii easy

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
totally open source it's like 50 bucks

423
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
uh if you're gonna dive into this stuff

424
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,440
get the version

425
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
uh that has 512 megs of of space for the

426
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,399
flash

427
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,600
um

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,199
some of the firmware images are starting

429
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,880
to get pretty big

430
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
which which is interesting i'm going to

431
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
go to that demo scene

432
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,839
thing

433
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
because i like things small but hey if

434
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
you got it you can use it the 512 is

435
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
what you want to get

436
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,480
and they're really pretty cool

437
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
if you're trying to copy low frequency

438
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,000
tags

439
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,799
make sure you get rewritable ones

440
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,919
um

441
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,400
the difference is like 35 cents instead

442
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,439
of 25 cents there are plenty of places

443
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
that that sell rewriteable or that sell

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,119
tags

445
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,760
that just have a serial number on them

446
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
and if you're a building person and you

447
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
want to program your building to open

448
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,360
things

449
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
not a big deal

450
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
you just tell the central system i have

451
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
a new tag it goes for this apartment

452
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,919
they can get onto the 10th floor or

453
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
whatever

454
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
so there are plenty of non-rewritable

455
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
ones make sure you get rewritable ones

456
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
um in the high frequency world if you're

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,679
going to be copying your hotel keys or

458
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,039
your fancier

459
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
access keys

460
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,559
you want to get what are called magic

461
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
keys

462
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
every key in the high frequency world

463
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,919
i'll get into this a little bit more in

464
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,200
a minute

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
has a unique identifier and you need to

466
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,320
be able to rewrite that in order to to

467
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
do some some really fun stuff

468
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
so those are my two notes for you so

469
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
that you save a little money on the low

470
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,679
frequency you're saving yourself a

471
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,640
dollar

472
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
but the magic ones chinese sometimes

473
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,720
they call them

474
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
for the high frequency or what you want

475
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,480
to get

476
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
all right

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,919
let's look at my problem

478
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
a little self-centered sorry

479
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,880
um

480
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
so what i had was this blue thing

481
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
and i wanted to copy it onto something

482
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
it was low frequency

483
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
and i'll show you live in a minute how

484
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
to do this but these things have just

485
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
two pieces of data on them

486
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
they have a facility code which is

487
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,200
basically what building

488
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
they're they're allowed into and then a

489
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,799
card number

490
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
and that's pretty much just a serial

491
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
number and these really are like

492
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,919
physical keys they really it's really

493
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,480
just basically like a pinning it's just

494
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
numbers and then the reader just kind of

495
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
goes

496
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,559
okay

497
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,080
um and

498
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,640
they're super easy to clone that's what

499
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
i found out

500
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,600
really much to my

501
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
serious amusement

502
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
um and then much to my friends amusement

503
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
until they were not amused anymore as i

504
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
copied all their stuff

505
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
but

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
but i didn't save any of it it was

507
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
really just like hey can i try to copy

508
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,679
your key and they were like yeah

509
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,720
and i was like i'm not going to say

510
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
anybody you just have like you have to

511
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
promise to tell me if it works or not

512
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
and then like next week when i saw them

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
they were like

514
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,880
oh it works

515
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
the hotel room keys these are high

516
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
frequency

517
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
what you need to know is the unique

518
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,559
identifier of the key because all the

519
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,559
data that's encrypted is based on the

520
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,039
unique identifier kind of like assault

521
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
near as i can tell

522
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
again not total expert there are some

523
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
really crazy experts and i hope none of

524
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,679
you are in the audience

525
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,200
although during the q a you're welcome

526
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,159
to come up and just rush the

527
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
mic

528
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
and then you'll be dumping out

529
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
the binary data from these things and

530
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
then breaking the encryption

531
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,640
these things suffer from the same

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
problem that that we see all the time

533
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
which is

534
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
don't invent your own encryption what

535
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
the heck are you thinking

536
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
um but they do so there are some attacks

537
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,039
um and then you'll be then you'll be

538
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
right again

539
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
now here was the fun thing for me

540
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,559
leading up to this talk was i was like

541
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,360
well

542
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
i got 50 minutes

543
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
and usually i can do this in 20 minutes

544
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,919
so

545
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
let's get some rfid blockers i'll try

546
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,679
these a little bit later i've got some

547
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,520
paper ones

548
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
i've got

549
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,080
oh these are active ones

550
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,039
i've got oh you're just cards

551
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
tsa had a really fun time when this

552
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
thing went through

553
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,720
um so

554
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
rfid blockers

555
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
there are plenty of those out there

556
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
um and the

557
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,159
amazon reviews usually are like

558
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,159
i don't know if it works but it fits in

559
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
my wallet it's cool

560
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
i'm not even kidding it's hilarious uh

561
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,960
really hilarious um

562
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
or it's scary i don't know i'm just

563
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,240
gonna go with lol

564
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,600
um

565
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,559
the

566
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,760
there's there are a few different types

567
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
and

568
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
one of them is these paper guys

569
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,039
is just it's just like a sleeve

570
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
paper sleeve and you just stick your

571
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
card in there and then it's safe from

572
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
the elite hacksaws

573
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
i also brought

574
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
rfid blocking

575
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
fabric

576
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
pretty cool you could make you could

577
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
totally make a tin foil hat out of this

578
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,320
it's great

579
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
buy it by the yard so we'll figure out

580
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,840
if this one works

581
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,799
i

582
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,679
have oh i have a little pouch

583
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,039
this is for your your car key fob

584
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
uh theoretically

585
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
so that nobody can do like a

586
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,080
replayer person in the middle attack so

587
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
we'll try that guy

588
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,880
um and then oh and then i have these oh

589
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
also by the way i don't want to go home

590
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
with any of this chunk it's it weighs

591
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
so

592
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
when we're done everybody just come and

593
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,520
grab some of this junk

594
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,679
um and then i've got these active ones

595
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
now these are really cool

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
so we'll try these out

597
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
theoretically these are rfid cards that

598
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,520
when they get energy all they do is they

599
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
just kind of go

600
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
and block anything from reading those

601
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,439
so we'll try those too as well

602
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,320
let's do it let's try it all right

603
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
so

604
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
what i've got here

605
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,600
i'm running proxmark i've got one here

606
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
um

607
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,280
pretty simple hardware

608
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
by the way when you when you get one or

609
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,679
if you do get one

610
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,679
and it's like hey flash the firmware and

611
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,280
all that kind of junk there's a lot of

612
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,559
like stuff to do

613
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,559
if you if you get one that's been

614
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
pre-flashed you can kind of skip a lot

615
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,919
of that stuff and i think kali might

616
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,880
actually

617
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,919
ship with the proxmore client on it so

618
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,520
you don't have to go totally crazy on

619
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,559
day one you don't have to like i mean

620
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,360
putting an arm gcc compiler on there and

621
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,720
cross compiling

622
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
can be a little daunting you can get

623
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,080
into this stuff pretty fast without

624
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,400
flashing anything

625
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,159
all right so let's take a look

626
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
here's my blue

627
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
my blue key that was annoying the heck

628
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
out of me

629
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
and put it on here

630
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,840
and all i have to do is tell

631
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
proxmark to search for a low frequency

632
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
tag

633
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
all right demo gods love me

634
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,559
so what you're looking at here um

635
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
not my true codes

636
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,360
uh

637
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
although it'll really only get you up to

638
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,159
the pool and you're welcome to go to my

639
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,159
swimming pool

640
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,360
what you got here is a facility code

641
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,039
206

642
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,760
and then a card number

643
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
that's kind of cool it's like a 404

644
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
and

645
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,640
it's telling me the data format is hid

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
so i kind of know what i'm doing there

647
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
and then it tells me that there's

648
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
actually a t55 in there

649
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,799
um so this is probably what you're gonna

650
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,159
see the most

651
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,960
when when you try to do like those

652
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,799
silly keys that get you the swimming

653
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,320
pool or something like that

654
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,279
uh or garage keys they're it there's not

655
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
a lot to steal

656
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
so they go with the cheapest stuff they

657
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
can find

658
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
and then what i can do

659
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
let's see where are my cheat sheets

660
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,399
there we go

661
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
what i can do is from there

662
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
all i have to do

663
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,400
is have a rewriteable card

664
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,480
oh you're the rfid blocker i don't want

665
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
you

666
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,240
and just throw it on here

667
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,880
i got a tag here so i'll just do that

668
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,320
this is the simplest silliest

669
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
really silliest thing um and this is why

670
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
my friends like hide their cell phones

671
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,360
when i'm around now

672
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,279
is

673
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
but it's very it's very short range

674
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,159
so that's also the cool thing is this is

675
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
very short range

676
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
um so

677
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
i mean if if you want to go to like

678
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,919
defcon and see people boasting that they

679
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,080
can do this from a bunch of feet that's

680
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,799
great take specialized hardware but to

681
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,880
actually clone one of these suckers

682
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
you really need to get up close and

683
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
personal with it

684
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,799
um so like if anybody's i mean you can

685
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,799
make you're welcome with my tinfoil hat

686
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,120
stuff after i'm done but

687
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,039
it's actually really simple and all i

688
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
have to do is just say i'm going to do a

689
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
low frequency

690
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,640
hid card because that's what i've got

691
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
here

692
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
and then what i'm going to do is i'm

693
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,799
going to clone it

694
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,960
with a facility code of i don't know

695
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,400
whatever

696
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,279
and a card number of whatever

697
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,559
and

698
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,880
here's where it gets interesting

699
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,600
you do need to know your data format but

700
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,480
this sucker is pretty much always it

701
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,240
let's see if it works will it blend

702
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
oh for

703
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,799
let me go with a better one then

704
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,039
i'm just gonna go with i'm just gonna

705
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
clone

706
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,039
what i've got

707
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,840
and let's just call you 200.

708
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
so close enough

709
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,039
and there you go like that was it

710
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,240
that it's we're done

711
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,520
and then i can read it

712
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
and it's it's written

713
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,200
and like this tag came with the the

714
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
reader

715
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,320
so those guys are real easy to do

716
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
let's take a look at a high frequency

717
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
these are a little sneakier because

718
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
because the high frequency ones are

719
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,960
smart so they can actually do encryption

720
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
so we actually have to run through some

721
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
attacks

722
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,279
but

723
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,600
the folks who do the prox mark 3 junk

724
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,440
they are so nice to us they actually

725
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
made it real easy so let's see where's

726
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,760
my oh there you are

727
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,320
all right there's my hotel key

728
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,840
nobody takes screenshots as i do this

729
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
um all i have to do is say hey tell me

730
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,039
if there's anything out there

731
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
this will come in handy for the rfid

732
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
blocking stuff too

733
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
and it says hey yeah there you go we've

734
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
got something

735
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
now this line up here uid

736
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
this is going to be important

737
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
everything is encrypted based on a uid

738
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,600
so i'm going to need that

739
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,799
and then it's telling me that it's a

740
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,279
myfair classic 1k so this is

741
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
what i've seen with like my last 12

742
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,559
hotels

743
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,240
hopefully other hotels have fancier junk

744
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,679
but these don't just fairfield

745
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,360
fairfield and suites i don't think

746
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
they're really going to break the bank

747
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
on that stuff

748
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
and so what i can do is

749
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
i can just say

750
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
they were so nice to us that they made

751
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
an auto bone

752
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,439
function

753
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,799
and i can just tell it to run through

754
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,159
and so now it's going to run through

755
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
it's going to try to

756
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
do a couple of different brute force

757
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
attacks

758
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,039
um it's trying to find the encryption

759
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,320
keys

760
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,520
and

761
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
again like don't invent your own darned

762
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
encryption

763
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,559
we're actually being able to break into

764
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,600
it

765
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
that actually sounds like a really fun

766
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
party out there

767
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,240
i won't blame you if people want to like

768
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,399
go hang out and have a party but we're

769
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,678
we're almost done here too

770
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,960
all right it's giving me time remaining

771
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
oh yep there we go

772
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
is that it well it thinks it's gonna

773
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
take two days i don't have that much

774
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,720
time

775
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
but then it's gonna narrow it down a

776
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
little bit

777
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,720
a little bit more

778
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
all right

779
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
see this is really cool because like

780
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
like the the windows update progress bar

781
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
would be getting longer and longer this

782
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,960
one actually

783
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
gets shorter and shorter um i think it's

784
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,960
going to get it pretty soon

785
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
point is there there are attacks to be

786
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
done against these cards it does not

787
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
take very long

788
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
um

789
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,559
and but also even with the high

790
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
frequency ones

791
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,279
you

792
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,799
you really do need to get up close and

793
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,520
personal with them so like

794
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
i'm i'm gonna give away all these so if

795
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,000
you are paranoid you can like put your

796
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
card in these but

797
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,120
um

798
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
pretty much somebody's gonna have their

799
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,559
hand on your butt before they can

800
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
actually do it and then all i have to do

801
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
there now

802
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,480
magic chinese magic card

803
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,679
is say okay

804
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
um

805
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,679
my uid

806
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,720
let's paste you

807
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
let's take out these spaces

808
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,960
boom okay now this has the unique

809
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
identifier of my hotel key

810
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,200
and then

811
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,039
i really like that music that's really

812
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,200
fun

813
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,399
um

814
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
and then

815
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,640
paste you and i'm just going to say hey

816
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
whatever i pulled out of there just

817
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,360
throw it right back on this card

818
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,760
it gets a little messy

819
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
lots of interestingness on the way out

820
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,519
um but i've had success with these and

821
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,440
so that actually should open the door

822
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
and that's the demo on those let's talk

823
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
about rfid blockers though

824
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,760
so

825
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
low frequency tag let's see let's see

826
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
what happens i've got a paper

827
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,559
there's a nice oh there's a big one big

828
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,600
one for

829
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,080
protecting your passport

830
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
these are cool they're retro so it's

831
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,799
like hey look i'm a video cassette

832
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,960
thing

833
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,640
all right let's try let's see

834
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,919
okay

835
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,919
all right that one works

836
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,000
let's try you on one of these little

837
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
guys

838
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,720
and then i'm also going to do a high

839
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
frequency oh

840
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,279
dear

841
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,000
oh the little guy found it all right

842
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
let's try a high frequency on one of

843
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,840
those

844
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
all right so this one might be kind of

845
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
effective all right so

846
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,880
if you're gonna take some of these free

847
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
ones home

848
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
that one's a good one

849
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,399
uh oh let's try the car

850
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,960
the car key fob one let's try that i'm

851
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
gonna try that with my actual apartment

852
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,960
key here

853
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,120
again like all the amazon reviews are

854
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,000
like i don't know if it works but

855
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,039
it looks cool and i use it um and it

856
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,640
fits in my pocket

857
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,360
also gets scanned through my pocket all

858
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,799
right let's try a high frequency one

859
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,200
see if this thing's worth the 5.99 i

860
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,120
spent on it i limited myself to um

861
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,919
25 budget for these blockers

862
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
i think that's about what they're worth

863
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,158
and

864
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
nope all right so this one blocks high

865
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,240
frequency uh which

866
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,039
hopefully saves your car from getting

867
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,039
stolen

868
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,679
oh active these are the active ones

869
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,039
so let's take a look at this

870
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
let's see

871
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,240
let's try you

872
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,799
low frequency

873
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
whoops all right

874
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,679
let's try you with the hotel

875
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,480
key and it seems a little bit better

876
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,000
all right so the active ones seem to

877
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
work and

878
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,960
ooh tin foil oh

879
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,159
oh

880
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,839
oh sorry active card

881
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,599
okay so

882
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,440
if if you're gonna pick up free stuff

883
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,879
after the show this is not the one

884
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,320
i think that was the most expensive one

885
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,679
too i think i paid seven dollars for

886
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,079
that card

887
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,119
let's try

888
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
foil hat

889
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,960
all right

890
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
just gonna i'm not even gonna double it

891
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,639
up i'm just gonna go with one layer

892
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,520
if you make a hat you might wanna

893
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,599
make it more than one layer

894
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,079
oh darn it all right well it reads

895
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,440
through that

896
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
let's try

897
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,560
where did i put my hotel key right there

898
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,680
all right let's try hotel key

899
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,040
looking

900
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
good

901
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,599
all right

902
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,320
tinfoil hat for the win all right

903
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,119
you can buy that stuff by the yard it's

904
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,640
a little expensive it's not that

905
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,960
expensive but you can buy it by the yard

906
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,280
so you can make a hat maybe next year my

907
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,720
talk will be how to make a tinfoil hat

908
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
um and that's

909
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,040
all i've got except i've got

910
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,200
like i borrowed one of my girlfriend's

911
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,599
ipsy bags let's try that

912
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,640
let's see

913
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,520
hotel key

914
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,880
i'm just gonna

915
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,680
hang that there

916
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,359
all right all right so don't use an ipsy

917
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,200
bag

918
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
let's try

919
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
let me see i'm just going to put my

920
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
driver's license in front of this

921
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,599
let's try that

922
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
this will be the last one

923
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,839
all right so it reads through there

924
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,320
that's fine so as you can see kind of

925
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
like interesting results body results uh

926
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,240
some of these block things some of them

927
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,119
don't

928
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,000
but you have to get really close

929
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
but

930
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
really close

931
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,800
to someone's butt to actually scan the

932
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,920
card that's in their wallet

933
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
so

934
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
now that you know about all that

935
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
i'll show you a couple of other things

936
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,000
you can do

937
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,760
nfc tags they work in this range as well

938
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
and i have a bunch of those up here as

939
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,160
well that i don't want to take home so

940
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
you all are welcome to have them

941
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,839
emv is for your credit cards

942
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,560
the

943
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,079
just these frequencies you can play

944
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,320
around with that stuff emv is pretty

945
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
darn secure um

946
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,359
it's

947
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,160
really cool stuff uh because we didn't

948
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
come up with it here we came up with it

949
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,720
with like scientists

950
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
e-paper displays

951
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,640
these are really neat these e-paper

952
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,119
displays there are ones especially the

953
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,200
ones they use in supermarkets

954
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,040
that use rfid frequencies and the energy

955
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
to rewrite the the display

956
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
so you can get them i've i've actually

957
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
got a couple that i'm just playing

958
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,800
around with

959
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
um naturally you have to have the reader

960
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
to update it so it's not like like your

961
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,119
paper display that's connected to a

962
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,440
raspberry pi or something but it's

963
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
really kind of fun

964
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
and then one of the things that

965
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,160
more and more people are talking about

966
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
is java cards the high frequency cards

967
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,359
get smart enough that you can actually

968
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,920
run java applets on them and so there

969
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
actually are cards that'll run it

970
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,400
and so similar to the way that like the

971
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
old graybeards

972
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,839
when we were all plugging arduinos into

973
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,000
everything they were like well you know

974
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,520
firmware is better i don't know why you

975
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,839
run software that's terrible java cards

976
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,160
are the same trick is now we can tell

977
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
graybeards like hey i'm just going to

978
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
write something in software i don't care

979
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,200
about hardware

980
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,280
so that's really cool

981
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,400
and then uhf ultra high frequency

982
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
these are totally different tags um they

983
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
use them for like toll passes

984
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
uh stuff like that my prox mark iii

985
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,440
won't deal with them

986
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
but kind of fun stuff to be done in

987
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,400
there

988
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
um

989
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
my garage actually there's a uf uhf tag

990
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
you can use for that but it's a

991
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,160
different reader

992
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,320
and there are a bunch of places

993
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,880
that you can go to get more information

994
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,520
this stuff is kind of like it's sort of

995
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,400
spread around a little bit um and

996
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,520
there's

997
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,440
a bit of a rtfm kind of thing like don't

998
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
go into these communities and just be

999
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,200
like i want to copy a key what are the

1000
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,280
commands

1001
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,520
because i showed them to you but also

1002
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
because like people see right through

1003
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
anytime somebody joins and they're like

1004
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
i'm trying to copy this thing because i

1005
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
need a copy for my own personal use um

1006
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,240
everybody sees that

1007
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
uh for what it is um but there's a

1008
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,280
discord for rfid hackers there are

1009
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,880
forums out there

1010
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
um the tags themselves the data sheets

1011
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,440
tend to be open and and publicly

1012
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
uh out there so if you can read that

1013
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
kind of junk which

1014
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,079
i can't

1015
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,880
um

1016
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
the the the data sheets are out there

1017
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,839
it's it's all public

1018
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,320
one other thing i found really useful is

1019
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,440
that vendors explain this stuff they

1020
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
have little like explainer videos

1021
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,720
so

1022
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,960
they're trying to sell you something but

1023
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
they have to educate you first

1024
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,880
so there are plenty of videos out there

1025
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,520
from vendors themselves uh typically of

1026
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,359
the readers

1027
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,280
that will explain this stuff in pretty

1028
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
simple terms it's it's pretty cool

1029
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,839
naturally

1030
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,319
you can go totally crazy on a shopping

1031
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,640
spree and have fun

1032
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,880
and just pick some stuff up you know

1033
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,800
whether whether it's

1034
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,319
uh whatever your site of of of choice is

1035
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,800
and the the walkthroughs the how to's

1036
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
are really really

1037
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,520
fun

1038
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,480
just really fun um and really just you

1039
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,960
just need to just kind of dive in which

1040
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,720
which is what i did

1041
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,160
to to solve my problem

1042
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,000
which

1043
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,640
let me just bring it around to that is

1044
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
my problem by the way

1045
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,040
was motorcycle ninja gain in the garage

1046
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,839
clubbed hands clutching throttle

1047
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,520
and what it turns out

1048
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,000
that one of the form factors is a ring

1049
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
and so i've got

1050
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,680
a ring that has a low frequency

1051
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
chip and coil in it

1052
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
and i can actually

1053
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,480
open my garage door with it

1054
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,090
and that's it have fun

1055
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:31,440
[Applause]

1056
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,040
yeah we got time for questions if you

1057
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
want

1058
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,440
you were the first hand

1059
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,078
he says

1060
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,839
oh interesting so it's about

1061
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,560
just like physics is adding depth

1062
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,560
distance

1063
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,440
copper sightings can be hard to make a

1064
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,920
hat out of

1065
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,680
okay

1066
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,800
so you can do this stuff from the

1067
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,839
hardware store the rfid blockers

1068
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,319
very cool

1069
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,160
all right

1070
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
thank you yeah so you can just go to the

1071
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,520
hardware store and find

1072
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,880
copper and

1073
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,480
just make your own pouches

1074
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,839
oh did it work for low frequency

1075
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,720
so for the low frequency you might need

1076
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,919
like corrugated steel or something

1077
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,680
so the frequency makes a big difference

1078
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,359
because of the the way that it's done

1079
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
the electric field and things like

1080
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,520
conductive things like copper

1081
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,680
that's why that works better for the

1082
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,880
high frequency

1083
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,720
thank you all right uh what other

1084
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,160
questions did i have out there yes

1085
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,040
the learning curve is actually not that

1086
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
bad um

1087
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
i mean if you're like a weekend project

1088
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,440
kind of person it's it's pretty cool

1089
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,880
it's pretty good

1090
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720
there are how-to's out there there are

1091
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,480
how-tos included in the source code

1092
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,240
and you really just need to like look

1093
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
around a little

1094
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,920
play a little um

1095
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,720
everybody who's done like how-to's is

1096
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,560
like me they don't really know what

1097
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,000
they're doing

1098
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,839
but you'll find the right commands that

1099
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,040
make it work

1100
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
and then you can play around and then

1101
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
you can go on to the discord or the

1102
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
forums and

1103
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,960
you know once you've done your rtfm

1104
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
they're really helpful people out there

1105
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,040
yeah it's not bad yeah another

1106
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,400
oh yes the prox mark 3 does look like a

1107
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,240
desktop device it actually is pretty

1108
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,520
portable

1109
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
the usb you can charge it off usb power

1110
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
so you just need a battery pack

1111
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
um they make one

1112
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,839
you've got the rdb4 right

1113
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,000
yeah

1114
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,880
yeah so they they make smaller ones than

1115
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,240
the one that i have

1116
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,800
but they are designed to run in

1117
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,480
standalone mode

1118
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,000
not something i've messed with but they

1119
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,319
can emulate a card right out of the

1120
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,520
proxmark

1121
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,440
they can also emulate a reader right out

1122
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,079
of the prox mark

1123
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,119
yeah the proxx mark 3 is fantastic for

1124
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,880
emulating things

1125
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
the other one that i see mentioned is

1126
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
the chameleon

1127
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,000
um i think that's only high frequency

1128
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,079
but don't quote me on it

1129
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
and we're recording this so now somebody

1130
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,119
will quote me on it but um but yeah

1131
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,640
there are other tools but the prox mark

1132
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,079
is is a nice swiss army knife for that

1133
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,760
kind of stuff yeah

1134
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,319
can can the proxmark or any other tools

1135
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,240
actually emulate an rfid or do you

1136
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,119
always need to write to a card

1137
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,319
yeah they can emulate it yeah like

1138
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,560
maybe yeah yeah and there are some

1139
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,240
attacks that require that

1140
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,960
for you to hold it up and watch reeds

1141
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
happening

1142
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,680
yeah yeah it's pretty darn cool

1143
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,359
does those hoopy fruits really know

1144
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,119
where their towel is

1145
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,839
uh yes

1146
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,960
have you had any experience

1147
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,079
oh

1148
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,680
yes i want my flipper to get here um

1149
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,400
from what i've seen the flipper zero is

1150
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,839
pretty darn amazing

1151
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,800
oh yeah hit those dudes up hit you up

1152
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,520
um to check them out yeah uh the flipper

1153
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,240
zero looks really fantastic i don't have

1154
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,560
one yet um and i wasn't willing to pay

1155
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,560
800 on ebay yet um

1156
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,119
yeah they are available again yeah i put

1157
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,760
in my order uh it gets here in august or

1158
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,680
something so yeah you don't have to pay

1159
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,440
800 on ebay

1160
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,920
or be the early adopter who who luckily

1161
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
got in there before the rest of us knew

1162
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,839
about it

1163
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,240
all right so they do have orders going

1164
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,599
pretty quickly

1165
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
hopefully mine's there when i get home

1166
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,200
one more question

1167
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,680
have you ever tried to

1168
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,799
clone any of the uh

1169
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,520
i have not

1170
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,440
i had one friend

1171
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,160
i had one friend where i was like hey do

1172
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,920
you have any of these key fobs and she

1173
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,640
was like yeah i have one to get into

1174
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,559
into my office and i was like oh cool

1175
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,400
let me see if i can copy it and then

1176
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,040
looked at it and it was like a pico pass

1177
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
thing and i was like

1178
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,880
well good news is

1179
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,720
nobody's gonna be able to copy that

1180
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,559
anytime soon

1181
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,079
i don't know where they're where they

1182
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,880
stand on the whole des fire stuff and

1183
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,720
what they're doing with that yet

1184
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,040
but hopefully with any luck

1185
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,680
um the harder encryption algorithms they

1186
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,359
invented themselves

1187
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,280
uh instead of relying on cryptographers

1188
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,480
and we'll be able to break it

1189
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,200
all right that's it uh have fun go out

1190
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,079

for everyone the last talk of the night

1194
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,160
here in this track will be practical

1195
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,240
steps to improve privacy so if you're up

1196
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,839
for one more at 10 o'clock we'll be

1197
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,119

1198
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,160
oh yeah yeah

1199
