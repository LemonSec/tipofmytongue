hey there folks

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,400
so listen I'm fully aware that the uh

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
sequel to Dune is between this theater

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,620
and the rest of the con so I'm going to

27
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,680
give people probably 120 seconds to

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
maybe 200 seconds after the actual start

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,760
of two o'clock just to just to let him

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,860
kind of

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,319
wander in come down realize they're

32
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,420

like another 60 to 120 seconds for

45
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,740
people who are rushing to figure out

46
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,600
where the little theater is this is

47
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,740
people are still peeling the plastic off

48
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,780
of this convention they are still

49
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,520
finding that the little things on the

50
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
screen and they're pulling it off and

51
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
they're

52
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
finding some of the keys are stuck and

53
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
everything's going on

54
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,819
I while I'm waiting I just have an

55
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,900
interest

56
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,419
um as a human being which is and and

57
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,979
give me a show of hands from the

58
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,840
darkness

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,620
um

60
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,660
well first let's go for the fun one who

61
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,539
here has like never seen me before who's

62
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,940
never been part of this show all right

63
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,520
not a couple couple little hands there

64
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
how many people this is the first time

65
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,759
you've actually seen me in person and

66
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,500
not in a recording

67
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,180
okay

68
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,160
and how many people are like oh just

69
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,780
another episode of the Jason

70
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,520
Scott show

71
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,099
all right that's fantastic that's

72
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,380
exactly the kind of supportive audience

73
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,440
I need as I broadcast into the time and

74
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
everything else

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,020
so I'm glad we made it uh to where we

76
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,400
are now

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,460
we're we're at we're at a save point in

78
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,520
the big pandemic game

79
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,900
so great job I only got coveted twice so

80
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,039
I think we're doing pretty good

81
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,819
like I said we'll do another another 60

82
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,379
seconds just to see if someone I see

83
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,940
like already one person is like there

84
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,340
and that is why I think we're going to

85
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,198
completely revolutionize this field

86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
good afternoon everyone

friends with operation Hammond and we

95
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,519

96
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,839
but now

97
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,099
there are very few people where you can

98
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:44,880
say

99
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320

100
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,100
[Applause]

101
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
hello everybody I'm really glad to be

102
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,380
here here at Hope coming out of one

103
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,360
phase of the pandemic for the people who

104
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,100
will look at this recording in the

105
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,399
future a small hearty band of people are

106
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,380
basically living on the set of Dune

107
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,140
moving between small outbuildings in a

108
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,200
in a college somewhere in Queens people

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,940
barely know how to speak English anymore

110
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,800
some folks haven't talked to a real

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
human being in years we've relearned

112
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,480
some portions of the language we're not

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,540
sure who's going to truly survive but

114
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,640
whatever you do in the future remember

115
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,399
we did it

116
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,980
obviously for you so

117
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,080
um greetings from Anarchist jurisdiction

118
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
where uh people are having a good time

119
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,779
here like I said at the Hope conference

120
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,459
um my name is Jason Scott and I work for

121
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,240
a wonderful place uh it has a beautiful

122
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,700
building uh here but most people don't

123
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,380
know it by that they know it by the name

124
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,459
of the Wayback machine or

125
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,920
archive.org and the internet archive is

126
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,820
a massive conflagation of data and

127
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,399
dreams and wishes it's a place that was

128
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,940
built on the idea of making as much of

129
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,820
Life digital as possible making as much

130
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,320
of it a a an easily accessible

131
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,680
instantaneous set of media and memories

132
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,220
and parts of culture so that we ideally

133
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,180
could do things better make life better

134
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
and sometimes that's worked out

135
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,560
sometimes it hasn't but the experiment

136
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
continues I did not found the internet

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,899
archive but the internet archive found

138
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,740
me and I joined them about 11 12 years

139
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,620
ago and I've just been a huge mess and

140
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,420
when they hired me they were like well

141
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,459
what job do you want and I said I want

142
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,339
free range archivist and nobody knows

143
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,060
what that means which is perfect for me

144
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,040
I go around and I look at the world and

145
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,860
I say what parts of the world are not

146
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,060
advocating for themselves what I call

147
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,040
non-advocated media media that's cool

148
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
and neat or ephemeral or

149
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,380
representational of something who's

150
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,200
first impression is not to try to

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,380
preserve it for the generations to come

152
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,240
and so I've gotten my hands in a whole

153
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,880
bunch of different places and ideas and

154
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,279
part of that is communication and I'm

155
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,579
very comfortable with communication I'm

156
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,620
very very comfortable talking to people

157
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,140
and so a lot of times it starts out with

158
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,959
phone calls and Communications and

159
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,660
tweets and and DMS and Jason will you

160
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,940
come help with this thing we're seeing

161
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,980
and will you do it and a lot of it comes

162
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,660
from the fact that a lot of other people

163
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,180
have kind of internalized that they have

164
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,940
internalized the idea of like if I don't

165
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,100
do it nobody will

166
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,200
um so that means I spend a lot of time

167
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
out in the world

168
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
finding out about stuff that's at risk

169
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,380
or going away and and and and then

170
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,139
helping people either come to terms with

171
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,880
its interminable loss and the fact that

172
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,760
it'll be gone forever or assisting in

173
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,800
some direct way with

174
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,019
um making it live

175
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,320
for various values of forever

176
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,220
um

177
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,940
like videotapes right so

178
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,440
videotapes especially VHS tapes

179
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,779
represent a certain medium that from a

180
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,060
certain time whose time is rapidly

181
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,660
coming to an end where you have these uh

182
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,760
for the kids in the audience a set of

183
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,620
reels built into a small plastic

184
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,079
cartridge that click in and then play

185
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,120
standard definition usually video

186
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
through a machine mechanism that itself

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
is unbelievably complicated if you ever

188
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,940
want to see the face of God just open up

189
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,680
a VCR

190
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,380
and you will have your brain rearranged

191
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,420
at what actually goes on inside of this

192
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,820
horrifying Black Box

193
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,839
um and uh I had an opportunity to get a

194
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,160
lot of them

195
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,399
so what happened was that I was I was

196
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,279
you know communicated with by a group

197
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,880
and they were like hey there's a and

198
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
here's a little trick for you all

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,860
um so one of the reasons I'll attend so

200
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,480
when I use the phrase win I don't know

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,519
how much Victory really goes into it but

202
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,279
I will often win the debate of who do we

203
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,680
give it to and I'll win and the reason

204
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,959
I'll usually win is because some Corpus

205
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,540
of material will come out and it'll be a

206
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,220
whole bunch of things and somebody will

207
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,100
say I would love that but I only want

208
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,860
this five percent of it or I only want

209
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,899
these nine things usually for the

210
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,339
purposes of some level of

211
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,959
financialization I want to sell it on

212
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,279
eBay or something

213
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,380
and the person who's sitting on top of

214
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
all this crap says no I'm not going to

215
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,959
crawl all over my pile like a roach and

216
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,940
pull out the three shiny beads for you

217
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,040
and I come along and I go I would like

218
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,899
all of it no questions asked if I can

219
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,860
come by tomorrow that wins but your

220
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,620
Victory prize is this

221
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,500
um you get a big bunch of boxes so there

222
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,139
was an anime store anime and fan store

223
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,220
in New Jersey that had closed 10 15

224
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,220
years ago and the family that had this

225
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,459
store was moving and so they said hey

226
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,860
could somebody possibly take some of

227
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,820
these tapes away people communicated me

228
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,500
and then I showed up and said I will

229
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,600
take all of it

230
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,399
and they were like well that's pretty

231
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
funny

232
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
and so that's how I suddenly found

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,959
myself in the VHS business

234
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,040
um with whole ranges of these tapes and

235
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,199
I of course had done it without really

236
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,720
paying much attention to the the direct

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,180
concepts of like what are what what are

238
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,519
these particular tapes and many of them

239
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,940
were what were called anime fan subs and

240
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,940
this goes back to an environment where a

241
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,380
whole range of media was available in

242
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,740
other countries and this media would um

243
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,540
be copied over but it would be in

244
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,160
another language and then groups of

245
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,100
amateurs would take it upon themselves

246
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
to translate put on subtitles and then

247
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,139
make them available usually as second

248
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,079
and third and fourth and 17th generation

249
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,120
copy some of which which we would be

250
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,180
sold at events and some of them would be

251
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,120
um distributed and there were fan

252
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
subgroups

253
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,040
people who had different styles and as

254
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,480
you can see here

255
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,060
there was a great ability to use uh

256
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,720
color inkjet printers for labels and so

257
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
you would get these really Exquisite

258
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,620
lost runes indicating you know

259
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,899
somebody's perception of what they

260
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,699
should be and you'd end up with these

261
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,639
weird takes on what part of the movies

262
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,699
they were so it to me it was fascinating

263
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,560
this however left me with a problem

264
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,040
which is I don't like things being left

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
on their original decaying medium for

266
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,940
very long

267
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,579
and I also know it is very very hard to

268
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,100
get people to do what I call unfunded

269
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,800
mandates which is where I go that you

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,180
should do this

271
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,399
and when they I tell people to do that

272
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,980
they do it for a little while maybe just

273
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,660
on the force of being afraid of the guy

274
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,459
in the suit and the hat but it doesn't

275
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,920
last for very long because unlike Sauron

276
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,560
you know or or the eye of Mordor I can't

277
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,420
really keep watching them for very long

278
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,579
before I have to go to the next thing

279
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,519
so I decided I was going to do it myself

280
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,279
um so there's a whole variety of anime

281
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,980
out there obviously anime has become

282
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,079
much more mainstream but this represents

283
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,500
kind of like late 1980s 1990s anime and

284
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,899
if you look at it you know you start to

285
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,180
realize that there's these kind of like

286
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,339
cross-cultural moves and attempts to

287
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,120
move them but it's all on videotape now

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,399
when I encounter a new medium and it's

289
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,319
not new in the general sense but it's

290
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
new to me I try to understand what are

291
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,720
we talking about like what is this now

292
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
for a lot of VHS it's standard

293
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,539
definition video which is a certain

294
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,140
realm of resolution it is interlaced

295
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,480
which means that a field comes down and

296
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,280
then another field comes down to produce

297
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,579
one frame of video because it dates back

298
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,880
to a concept of a phosphorus piece of

299
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,580
glass being lit by a laser beam aimed at

300
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,380
your children

301
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,640
that would be manipulated by two magnets

302
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,620
and uh now you're going to turn it into

303
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,760
a digital file and what I have realized

304
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,059
over time this is hard one knowledge I

305
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,919
didn't realize it here I just knew it

306
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,100
would apply is you do not if you can

307
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,280
avoid it get in a situation where nerds

308
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,620
have a pow-wow on how to take an action

309
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,500
because they all have their own personal

310
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,559
beliefs on everything and it is a

311
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,600
religious War because they will not just

312
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,760
State what they do but they will state

313
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,460
it as the one true thing that has to

314
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,000
exist the one idea that has to be the

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
one that absolutely wins and the other

316
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,860
guy is not just getting it wrong or has

317
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,039
an alternate opinion but absolutely is

318
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,720
the devil

319
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,960
um so like I said you can get you can

320
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,660
get incredibly intense and it's not very

321
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,240
pleasant so I ended up having this

322
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
solution which was

323
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,880
I created a first of all I had a Discord

324
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
and I created a channel called tape

325
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,419
everything

326
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,280
then I went on to Twitter

327
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,340
and I demanded anybody who could respond

328
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,559
to me who knew anything about video or

329
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
anime come to that channel

330
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,480
and they all showed up and they didn't

331
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,400
realize they were on a Survivor Island

332
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,480
then I created a Google form survey that

333
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,240
asked these questions you know how many

334
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,059
tapes have you digitized uh what method

335
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,580
do you use what Hardware do you use what

336
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,500
software approach do you use what's your

337
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,539
biggest problem with and so basically I

338
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,220
tortured them inside of a small glass

339
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,380
jar

340
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,880
centrifuged all their dumb little brains

341
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,080
into this High test Ultra video nerd and

342
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,419
then ended up choosing that particular

343
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,580
method now I want to point out that the

344
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,320
ingredients that I used were people who

345
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,299
were followers on Twitter who were not

346
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,220
professionals who were willing to walk

347
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,500
into a Discord and be tortured for their

348
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
information that is of course a built-in

349
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,020
bias but I came up with a methodology

350
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,380
this way and the the methodology I chose

351
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,600
could be wrong

352
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
it could be wrong but I chose it right

353
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,539
so once I knew that I had some sort of

354
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,460
methodology that would work a certain

355
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,140
way and would work a certain technical

356
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,640
way and I'll tell you those details

357
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,919
because people like those details

358
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,980
I said okay and now I'm going to do that

359
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,360
forever

360
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,419
and and see what happens

361
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,900
um so a lot of this of course was taking

362
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,140
place while an awful lot of people were

363
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,700
dying you know people who were close to

364
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,100
me people who weren't close to me people

365
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,340
who were very close to my age people who

366
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,440
were not close to my age and people who

367
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,659
were younger than me my mother died my

368
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,840
uncle died a number of people who worked

369
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,320
with me died uh not co-workers but

370
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,940
friends and Friends of co-workers or

371
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,740
people who I didn't affiliated with and

372
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,799
this felt like a lot of weight to have

373
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,299
and there's different ways you can

374
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,780
respond to that that emotional hit and I

375
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,840
think if you come from a stressful

376
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,000
situation and I had a heart attack at

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,059
46. so clearly I love stress like a

378
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,720
meatball sub

379
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,539
you can carry that weight and not know

380
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,179
you're carrying that weight and one way

381
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,159
to kind of feed into uh dealing with

382
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,039
that you know which is honest and true

383
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
pressure and Trauma is to get involved

384
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,120
in the minutia and details of a

385
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,179
meaningless local Civil War

386
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,260
and that's exactly what video is so

387
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,039
I could have gone into an awful lot of

388
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,000
sleeping

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,900
or I could just move on into the breach

390
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,640
and you can have your own way of doing

391
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,299
this my advice is go into the breach

392
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,120
and when you work on stuff like this

393
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
be aware that you're gonna always have

394
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,340
to deal with the fact that

395
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,299
there are a later Pantheon of use

396
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,799
progressively grayer and more hunched

397
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,539
over who think that you are an idiot

398
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,760
don't worry about those guys they're

399
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,000
really old and they can't run fast so

400
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,980
and they certainly can't run back in

401
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,260
time an open hand slap you while you're

402
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,059
at your computer so don't be too afraid

403
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,159
of them but they're there and they're

404
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
jerks

405
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,440
I ended up going in various directions

406
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
with the video and with video the first

407
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,659
part is the mechanism the the actual

408
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,780
machine that you will use to put videos

409
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,480
video tapes into that will then feed out

410
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
into a format in my particular case uh

411
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,799
the initial ones I was using was

412
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,900
something called a Sony MD 9500 which is

413
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,780
a VCR that

414
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,460
um goes into a uh MRI machine

415
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,520
so it's pretty hardcore

416
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,559
um can only do standard definition it

417
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,780
has a manual switch for high five versus

418
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,460
regular so you have to keep track of

419
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,760
that but boy Rock Steady

420
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,860
and let me tell you nothing is more

421
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,299
garbage

422
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,260
than an anime fan sub tape uh oh my God

423
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,480
it's like throwing a discarded fast food

424
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,320
wrapper into a nuclear physics

425
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,000
experiment it's the worst idea you could

426
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,460
ever have God knows what has happened to

427
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,380
this tape it has seen some

428
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,700
but this thing does its best to read

429
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
from it but it is very much like a like

430
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,340
a clean helpful social worker talking to

431
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,900
somebody who was just run over by a

432
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,120
garbage truck it's it's pretty crazy and

433
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,740
what's your signal I don't know anyway

434
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,820
so

435
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,220
the card I use is something called a

436
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,360
Blackmagic intensity Pro 4K it's about

437
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,799
199 bucks

438
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,840
um as you can see right there you're

439
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,600
like but wait a minute aren't that looks

440
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,440
like an HDMI uh I thought you're using a

441
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,900
VHS machine don't those not use V you

442
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,880
know whatever all right the way that it

443
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,580
does it is with a cable that looks like

444
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,559
an angel that comes down to grant you

445
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,320
your last witch and it's

446
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,500
it's it's horrifying the fact that this

447
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,100
is somebody's solution that exists that

448
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,320
is insane that's not right whoever that

449
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,080
is you're going to hell

450
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,179
the program I use is called virtual dub

451
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,100
it's open source it's available and

452
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,919
again I interrogated multiple experts

453
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,140
and went after them and said and I mean

454
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,419
literally with a massive stream of

455
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,240
profanity kept flinging screenshots at

456
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,580
them and going what do I select here

457
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,480
what are the frame settings what is the

458
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,299
format I ended up using a format called

459
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,200
lagarith lagarith is a lossless format

460
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,039
it has only one downside it uses disk

461
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,740
space like an out of control Coke addict

462
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,820
it is

463
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,120
it is an Ever it is a Non-Stop Las Vegas

464
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,140
Bender of video disc uh one hour of

465
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,140
video is about 35 gigabytes

466
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,440
yeah suck it down

467
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,120
I've always believed that when I am

468
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,159
grabbing a crappy version of Dragon Ball

469
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
Z that I should use more bandwidth than

470
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,120
transferred throughout the entire Global

471
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,620
Internet across the first three years of

472
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,219
its existence

473
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,200
but one of the advantages is once it

474
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,179
starts running you start to have some

475
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,460
pretty good images that are pretty easy

476
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,440
to read and when you look at this you go

477
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,720
Jason is it why am I seeing two at once

478
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,460
and the answer is oh no I was running

479
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,840
this I was doing this double-handedly

480
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,779
um so I had two Sony's doing the work

481
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,480
and banging them through

482
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
um and so I'm popping them in hoping

483
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
they don't get stuck setting the high

484
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,340
five versus regular five after running

485
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,340
it through putting it in grabbing it at

486
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,340
35 gigs an hour cropping the 35 gigs an

487
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,020
hour uploading it to the archive and

488
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,419
having the archive go ow

489
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,539
but it was working and I was living the

490
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,220
life of Riley here

491
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,500
um so Bunches of

492
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,559
fan Subs are going by now you know if

493
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,000
you sit back and look at the fan Subs

494
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,659
fan Subs are what they are no big deal

495
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,900
um you know looking back on this now you

496
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,340
can now say instead of this being an

497
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,559
illustration you suddenly realize that's

498
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
my to-do list I'm gonna have to shove

499
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,580
each one of these things into a machine

500
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,020
over and over again uh I've got 600 of

501
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,000
them to go through so I've been going

502
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,520
through them and of course sometimes

503
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,500
they look much more menacing than they

504
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,240
should

505
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,740
this was actually from a different fan

506
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,980
subgroup where I met this guy he said oh

507
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,020
you're doing fan Subs do you want our

508
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,840
entire back catalog and again I said yes

509
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,299
and that is how I worked out an episode

510
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:04,020
of Breaking Bad where I met this guy in

511
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,720
a rest stop in New Jersey to pass this

512
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,480
along on Super Bowl Sunday so he was

513
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
dressed in pajamas for his

514
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,340
uh Team

515
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,460
and handing over his anime fan subs and

516
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,020
driving into the night and I was like do

517
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,700
you want credit and he was like no

518
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,260
no so I can't tell you what group this

519
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,460
was

520
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,760
and does it look great no

521
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
no of course not I can barely make out

522
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,740
who's doing the translation

523
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,419
um when it doesn't work it doesn't work

524
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,120
awesomely but I am capturing it at 35

525
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
gigs an hour

526
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,860
um you have different approaches it is

527
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,480
not worth it right now to go into the

528
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,980
deep vagaries but I have been

529
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,779
progressively going through and in fact

530
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,760
I did finish them

531
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,580
um anime fan subgroups these days are

532
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,140
mostly famous for the fact that there

533
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,419
appears to be some where they get super

534
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,100
angry in the fan subtitles uh so that's

535
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,980
where all the stories are once you find

536
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,960
them of course they're all

537
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,020
they're glorious right is just so much

538
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,140
anger it's mostly one group one guy

539
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,899
really made it his mission to turn the

540
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,419
ending of every episode he translated

541
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,520
into a personal Vendetta blog

542
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,480
but what did it matter because what I'll

543
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
say all the time is it doesn't matter

544
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,120
like how incredibly great or incredibly

545
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,299
okay the process you're doing is as long

546
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,220
as you have a process that you can work

547
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,159
on That's non-destructive So the fact

548
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,140
that I'm digitizing these and I'm ending

549
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,260
up with these videos is not related to

550
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,140
like the content per se but I am closing

551
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,000
that air gap I'm making it digital

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,039
putting them up

553
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,220
um and so I have been progressively

554
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,720
going through

555
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,159
hundreds of tapes at this point and

556
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,500
being sent more and and now I am doing

557
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,059
VHS tape all day all night

558
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,559
um so naturally I'll want to Twitch

559
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,120
stream it

560
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,460
um so I've been Twitch streaming I have

561
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,020
been a twitch streamer

562
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,360
for a couple years now

563
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,120
and I don't know I don't know what 19

564
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,279
year old me would have thought about 50

565
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,580
year old me getting into the online

566
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,860
influencer business but here we are and

567
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,740
I have been basically live

568
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,500
streaming

569
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,020
digitizing VHS video for about two years

570
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,960
and I am in the I just found out from

571
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,520
one of these dumb tracker things that

572
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm in the top three percent of twitch

573
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,520
streamers

574
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,880
why why

575
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,039
but for me it's less about that than

576
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,520
feeling not alone that I build up let's

577
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,179
not use let's let's not pull the top

578
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,899
shelf wine of community into what this

579
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,720
is but let's call it a hangout group who

580
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
asked me questions and I respond to and

581
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,559
that helps me get over the hill of why

582
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,380
am I doing this because I can see the

583
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,020
reactions from the videos

584
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,059
this is that horror I was talking about

585
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,960
this is a umatic tape Reed head this is

586
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,760
what the aliens will find greeting them

587
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,820
when our species is gone and they land

588
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,640
this just spinning that and that and one

589
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,039
obsidian statue of Mario

590
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,679
so this is my little office slash

591
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,659
hellscape that I spend a lot of my time

592
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,559
in uh designed to be a streamer uh when

593
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,419
I'm on there I've got different machines

594
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,720
that are running I am now digitizing

595
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,360
three tapes at once I'm about to start

596
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,299
up doing five I think five is about the

597
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,020
limit of a normal human being

598
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,779
um there's the microphone where I go off

599
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,520
on random rants every once in a while

600
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,559
because that's what it does to you so

601
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,419
suddenly

602
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,600
I found myself in this new position in

603
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,860
this new place

604
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,899
so again people who had saw that there

605
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,640
was somebody who was willing now I

606
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,200
should say that in that original survey

607
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,480
when I said how many tapes do you do

608
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,640
before you give up sweating and hating

609
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,980
everything about life and the answer was

610
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,679
like on average about 25.

611
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,120
and I'm up around 800 now and I found a

612
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,159
small number of people who for whom they

613
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,840
were up in those numbers and they also

614
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,480
have found their Zen Place against all

615
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,640
this but it did mean that I was up for

616
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,140
anything

617
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,919
um

618
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,980
uh and in the meantime lots of cool

619
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,019
stuff was happening I only have one

620
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,120
slide for this but this is every

621
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,459
variation of every AOL CD

622
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,159
this showed up March

623
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,840
um so I'll be digitizing that

624
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,320
for the people so most of you get it but

625
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,940
for the small number of you looking left

626
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,559
and right going what the kind of

627
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,320
group did I just wander into I want to

628
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,840
say that AOL CDs were half of all CDs

629
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,080
produced in the 90s they represent a

630
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,860
comprehensive shameful portion of all

631
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,980
CDs made and there were over 5 000

632
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,320
variations made because it didn't take

633
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
people long to figure out these things

634
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,460
are awful

635
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,980
they worked by the way like if you go

636
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,559
reach the numbers AOL totally made Bank

637
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,620
on all this so here they are this was a

638
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,380
lawyer who worked for AOL who she had to

639
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,299
evaluate each one that came in to make

640
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,100
sure that it followed certain rules and

641
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,840
stuff and she kept everything and she

642
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,120
said I guess you're the person

643
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,419
and I said I guess I am

644
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,880
uh so yeah so I never thought I'd end up

645
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,620
in this world

646
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,260
um and this video quality is about right

647
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,840
for that so if suddenly you're like oh

648
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,179
but Jason where's the goods

649
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,419
um it's archive.org details slash fan

650
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,559
submarine uh as you can see 631 tapes of

651
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,019
the most delicious anime you've ever

652
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,100
seen presented shakily

653
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,539
remixed so you don't have to deal with

654
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,559
the original uh 35 gig lagarith you are

655
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,460
dealing with a 100 Meg MP4 so don't

656
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,200
worry your your bandwidth isn't going to

657
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,779
be destroyed unless you want it to be

658
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,580
do you have someone you don't like just

659
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,460
put this on their Wi-Fi

660
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,179
um

661
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,580
so that oil should be it but then uh

662
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,860
another person came into my life and

663
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,779
none of you know this person I didn't

664
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,360
know this person uh his name is Mark

665
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,260
Pines Mark Pines and I will never meet

666
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,799
Mark Pines Mark Pines died in 2020. he

667
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,059
was a musician he originally got his

668
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,220
start doing writing for cash box

669
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,059
magazine uh he had kind of fallen into

670
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,260
the realm of different

671
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,659
musicians and Industry people he bounced

672
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,419
between a couple jobs

673
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,399
he made his time between Connecticut but

674
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:08,280
he was really a New York boy he loved

675
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,540
being parts of the clubs he loved

676
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,760
apparently installing AV systems for

677
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,739
rock stars that he would know through

678
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,020
his various production businesses he

679
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,359
helped with as a result he became very

680
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,480
close with the musician Ron Wood he was

681
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,899
close to Knoll Poynter and a variety of

682
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,960
of people you would consider stars and

683
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,179
he had wide and then a ghoul had grabbed

684
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,699
his storage units in Connecticut where

685
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,119
all of his old stuff was and was putting

686
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,440
them on eBay

687
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,480
and it was originally going to piece it

688
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,000
out and another group of people had

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,399
suddenly felt the urge to buy it from

690
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,800
this guy from the ghoul

691
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,679
and the ghoul was in a weird position

692
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,760
because he

693
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,099
has the same response of all ghouls

694
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:03,240
which is a Smeagol like loss aversion

695
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,520
where every transaction of somebody

696
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
else's life represents an opportunity

697
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,660
for exploitation that may be pulled from

698
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,220
them you know the goal of like wow

699
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,560
they're offering me this much money for

700
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,480
a hundred items I bet I could turn each

701
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,400
item into something and just I don't

702
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,740
know how you know just just constantly

703
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,260
miserable constantly thinking that he's

704
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,160
one golden hit away from success

705
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,099
but by pure luck they were able to pay

706
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,800
him eight thousand dollars for Mark

707
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,740
Pines Estate and uh Mark Pines Estate

708
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,079
turned out to be many many tapes many

709
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,320
many different types of tapes

710
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,619
um and that's me and the buyer who

711
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,320
represented no less than a few dozen

712
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,660
people something like a you know 50 60

713
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,880
people who each put money in for the

714
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,859
eight thousand dollars to save what was

715
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,560
in there just on the theory that it was

716
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,480
probably pretty cool

717
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,560
and then the problem was who's going to

718
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,119
store it

719
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,700
who's going to digitize it who's going

720
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,040
to make it available luckily all three

721
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,359
of those were answered with the same

722
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,079
person so inside are these very weirdly

723
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,400
put tapes of various weird formats with

724
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,359
various weird labels and

725
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:22,320
formats that I don't even know how to

726
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,300
deal with yet and if you're looking at

727
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,740
that going like what does that say it

728
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,220
says Hall and Oates real three Master

729
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,260
which is like at least something to say

730
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,119
like okay maybe I should not throw this

731
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,900
one into the trash

732
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,180
you know these sense of like the history

733
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,040
that was attached to this and what it

734
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,560
did and what what it's about

735
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,220
so I started kind of going through and

736
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,740
digitizing the VHS tapes to see what was

737
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,960
in there and here's screen grabs from

738
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,980
various

739
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,820
uh Productions and and they range wildly

740
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,260
now Mark Pines was born

741
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,660
um you know

742
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,260
late 50s early 60s he spent his 20s

743
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,440
doing writing and involving with bands

744
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,940
um in his

745
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,599
um uh 20s and 30s he's doing Club acts

746
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,780
he's doing video production uh by his

747
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,420

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,820
stuff he's helping with documentary

749
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,440
footage

750
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,140
um and then into his 50s and 60s he's

751
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,700
you know

752
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,980
hanging out with his buddies he's

753
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,680

754
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,660
people's houses he's good for like

755
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,180
playing at the clubs and so when he

756
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,020
finally dies he leaves behind a just a

757
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,640
beautiful spectrum of folks of

758
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,260
interesting folks who like remember

759
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,579
their buddy Mark uh you know he touches

760
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,859
in weird ways in life

761
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,780
um he had a really close female friend

762
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,240
who hung out with him and she was the

763
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,880
victim of The Craigslist Killer so his

764
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,700
name shows up in writings about The

765
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,440
Craigslist Killer because he ended up

766
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,820
speaking for her because she wasn't

767
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,920
around to speak about who she was as a

768
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,140
person but on the other hand he's just

769
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,800
kind of there but where is he well he's

770
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,599

774
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,540

interviewing people this is Mark Pines

776
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,980

is him smiling in some of the shots and

781
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,040
getting in as only a person who does

782
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,740
production can kind of wandering in at

783
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,380
the edges for a moment speaking and I

784
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,180
have hours of Mark talking to people

785
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,280
because of it interviewing them to get

786
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,599

another musician

816
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,740
and what it turned out Mark had done

817
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,560
over the years was he had captured

818
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,920
New York that wasn't there in his work

819
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,859
in in the world right like kind of the

820
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,800
the edges of a world it wasn't always

821
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,040
designed to be produced and put into the

822
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,980
the the the the media landscape some of

823
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,680
it was just behind the scenes interviews

824
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,300
for some reason there's a fascination

825
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,000
with talking to people at clubs and

826
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,740
asking them questions or doing

827

promotional

828
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,160
um uh resume pieces for Fashions and uh

829
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,619
and and musicians to be able to then

830
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,020
pitch to others

831
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,500
and it's all sitting in a big pile in

832
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,680
Connecticut years out of date years away

833
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,060
on a dying format and suddenly here I am

834
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,339
these are casting tapes of child actors

835
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,880
from 1978 where each one reads from a

836
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,180
certain you know pre-formed one-minute

837
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,880
script

838
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,680
um for a group called Mary E White

839
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,880
Productions this is uh the child actor

840
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,560
who played Mikey in the serial

841
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,900
commercial four years after he had been

842
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,700
in that commercial

843
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,920
hitting the bricks to try to get himself

844
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,720
a brand new job

845
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,140
uh here's Tiny Tim the musician just

846
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,720
sitting around talking to people about

847
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,240
his act at one point he gets up and just

848
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,760
starts performing on the video a

849
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,020
performance of his that has never

850
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,660
existed on video that you can look at

851
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,099
online

852
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,660
and this to me is the weirdest one

853
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,300
this is Walter monheit

854
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,900
and again the the lack of gasps in the

855
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,420
audience tell me that Walter monheit was

856
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,000
in danger of being forgotten Walter

857
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,280
monheit was an Austrian bicycle

858
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,280
messenger in New York who had of course

859
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,800
these many horrifying stories in his

860
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,480
past and a brother who he had lost and

861
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,940
everything else who had become a

862
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,220
messenger and had found himself in the

863
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,220
grips of the then growing spy magazine

864
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,160
in New York and they were so Charmed by

865
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,980
his stories that they made him into a

866
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,200
character in spy so if you go to spy

867
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,119
they have Walter monheit and all he does

868
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,660
is drop fake massive quotes about movies

869
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,819
in the hope that they will reprint them

870
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:45,780
on the movie posters which worked which

871
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,099
worked

872
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,160
and when he died

873
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,900
obituaries talked about the fact that

874
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,680
his real stage of performance were clubs

875
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
where he would constantly chase after

876
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
ladies and do little balancing drink

877
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,460
tricks and tell long winding stories to

878
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,859
try to charm everyone around him

879
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,140
and there was no recording of him until

880
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,740
now so here's these recordings of this

881
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,839
lost little slice of a piece of New York

882
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,900
that isn't there and again this is all

883
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,420
because a man died

884
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,540
another group bought him at auction his

885
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,680
his estate and then it fell to me just a

886
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,740
series of random

887
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,040
smashes against random surfaces until it

888
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,740
ended up in the pockets of a Maniac

889
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,339
and there's so much of life that's saved

890
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,020
that way there's the life that Mark

891
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,180
lived and then

892
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,520
does Mark

893
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,660
ever visualize in his life that he would

894
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,119
end up being on a screen with a

895
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,140
conservatively dressed historian

896
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,599
pointing out his own life as if it was a

897
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,460
series of points in a beautiful

898
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,780
exhibition

899
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,880
I just say no

900
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,400
but I ask people who who live their own

901
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,599
lives and think that they're building

902
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,460
towards something is this what you want

903
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,859
is this a possibility that you want with

904
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,660
your own life is this a possibility is

905
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,980
there somebody in your life like a

906
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,619
Walter monheit yourself who maybe could

907
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,619
use a few frames of your video phone

908
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,720
asking them questions about their past

909
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,540
before they're gone that may have

910
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,180
meaning later because one of the

911
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,760
greatest sources of energy I tell people

912
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,940
is to take what is worthless to you and

913
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,400
is priceless to others it works for

914
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,099
everything it takes no time to babble on

915
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:43,079
about yourself but to somebody who is

916
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,780
your relative who may be here after

917
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,460
you're gone

918
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,260
the words that come out of your mouth

919
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,900
are the genetic line of their own family

920
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,000
history and we'll give them insight into

921
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,020
who they are I really encourage this I

922
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,760
know it's strange to encourage people to

923
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,800
talk more in the modern era but we don't

924
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,500
talk enough about what makes us what we

925
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,400
are and randomly Mark did he talked to

926
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,319
everybody these are people he just

927
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,160
scooped up that's a horror show that's a

928
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,440
um uh

929
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,020
just outside of a club there's a drag

930
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,020
event going on just talking to people I

931
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,700
haven't tracked all these people down

932
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,040
but I've Tracked Down many and found out

933
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,480
where their lives went

934
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,819
including Joey Wilson I didn't know who

935
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,819
this person was his music video stopped

936
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,619
at various points because it was a rough

937
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,200
cut and he's looking at the camera

938
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,800
um created an album in 1980 and it just

939
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,540
never worked out

940
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,300
it just never worked out his keyboardist

941
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,060
went to work for you too

942
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,740
and did production work and had worked

943
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,560
with blondie his guitarist his

944
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,319
saxophonist they all got jobs Joey just

945
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,420
floated around the Philly area and died

946
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,599
of a heroin overdose in 1997. a voice

947
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,579
gone but he's back we've put him on the

948
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,280
archive and put him on YouTube and he

949
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
writes some beautiful songs some One of

950
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,180
a Kind beautiful songs and his songs

951
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,660
live again because of where they were

952
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,460
and there's me

953
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,160
here's me I'm on the right

954
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,079
this is just me uh in 1987 where my

955
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,420
friend Jeremy and I had the

956
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,900
weirdest band ever it was called bovine

957
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,760
ignition systems

958
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,859
just the kind of name that two 17 year

959
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,440
olds would come up with and at the time

960
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,920
the local mall had a weird make a music

961
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,359
video shop where for twenty dollars

962
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,119
they could put you on a blue screen with

963
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,460
props and you would lip sync a song and

964
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,319
we said can we do our own song and

965
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,880
that's how we shot a 20-minute music

966
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,180
video

967
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,520
Jeremy who's on the right there has gone

968
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,619
on to an incredible career as a musician

969
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,260
he was one of the most popular bands in

970
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,800
Seattle called 80 something he's now a

971
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,140
group of a uh Hamilton and Broadway

972
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,560
cover group that does lots of work and

973
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,180
also he co-designed Internet Explorer

974
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,160
and aim

975
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,260
and steam

976
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,740
he's gone on to a great life and me I've

977
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,420
gotten by

978
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,079
But Here In This Moment is a Captured

979
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,760
Moment of two friends who don't know

980
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,040
what extends in front of them turned

981
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,220
into a digital world accessible to

982
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,260
everyone

983
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,720
to me that's all we can really ask for

984
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,680
as we look forward in our life

985
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,720
and then somebody offered me 8 000

986
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,118
videotapes and I said yes

987
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,440
that's what we do that's what life is

988
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,660
about that's all I ask of people you

989
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,520
will find yourself in a position as the

990
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,540
unintended guardian of what came before

991
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,760
especially now

992
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,700
um people who are idiots May debate

993
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,040
about whether or not our death rate has

994
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,900
slightly exceeded in the last few years

995
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,359
but what we're seeing in fast motion is

996
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,300
what's happening anyway the turnover of

997
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,000
generations the changing of Our Lives

998
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,339
from things we could depend on to things

999
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,640
we can't depend on anymore to being

1000
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,339
asked to do things that we didn't

1001
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,859
ourselves expect we would have to do to

1002
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,200
take responsibilities or actions that we

1003
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,059
didn't expect we would

1004
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,960
that's where we are so when this man

1005
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,680
died uh leaving behind 15 years of

1006
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,839
recorded Network television along with

1007
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:52,260
every TV Guide of every day with

1008
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,480
highlights in yellow

1009
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,119
I said yes

1010
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,800
and I hope that when you find yourself

1011
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,440
in a similar position you will know

1012
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,880
someone please don't let it be me

1013
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,440
who will also be yes

1014
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,720
who will also be that one voice that

1015
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,300
says yes I'll take it all I'll take your

1016
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,760
fan Subs I'll take your recordings I'll

1017
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,400
take what you have and I will try to be

1018
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,260
the guardian

1019
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,420
anyway to de-interlace you can use this

1020
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,520
filter it does uh blending you put it

1021
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,160
together and uh there's professional

1022
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,440
formats and then you can of course just

1023
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,059
use what they have as default thank you

1024
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:33,140
my name is Jason Scott

1025
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,559
I I don't I don't have any I hit time

1026
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,240
look at that

1027
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,579
um I'm going like I said I I'm not

1028
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,740
really I mean I guess if we have

1029
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,079
questions we can do questions but to be

1030
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,780
honest what's important to me is what I

1031
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,240
said at the opening event if for some of

1032
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,859
you missed it

1033
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,800
um it can be rather traumatic for a long

1034
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,500
time conference to upend its roots it

1035
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,880
has Moors and traditions and characters

1036
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,640
who wander in and wander out and what

1037
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,500
we've seen here is they've yanked the

1038
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,660
bulb out of the roots and they've

1039
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,579
planted it again in what we hope is

1040
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,540
fertile ground of uh queens and the hope

1041
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,140
is that this will flower in its own way

1042
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,760
in an Ideal World we don't even truly

1043
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,579
remember the time it was in the hope uh

1044
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,160
Hotel patent that we remember it as this

1045
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,339
amazing multi-faceted part of the

1046
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:38,880
Queen's culture that comes by like a

1047
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,940
beloved ship and lands and births and

1048
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,980
interacts with the community and it's

1049
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,040
dependent on you otherwise

1050
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,720
it's going to be nothing but twitch

1051
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,520
streams coming from here till forever

1052
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,260
and I'd rather we had a world where

1053
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,480
people could meet up again insanely

1054
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,020
happily and and find connections so

1055
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,380
please try to do that at this event

1056
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,780
if somebody has a question

1057
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,480
that they do they they're really like

1058
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,700
and and it is in the it ends with a

1059
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,419
question mark

1060
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,740
because I said something and you got to

1061
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,940
know

1062
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,160
shout it out

1063
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,960
anybody

1064
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,420
okay there we go absolutely no social

1065
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,220
contract go for it

1066
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,380
it's Mark from the internet archive oh

1067
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,240
no it's Mark from the internet archive

1068
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,420
hi Jason Hi Mark how's it going what's

1069
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,640
new great I just flew in last night and

1070
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,220
I was taking the D from the Bronx and I

1071
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,740
ran into Curtis Silva of all people and

1072
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,559
how did that go did you emerge intact I

1073
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,119
did he handed me his card while other

1074
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,040
people were like doing selfies the

1075
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,920
question is yes I believe in improving

1076
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,900
things secretly

1077
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,300
being really quiet about it so nobody

1078
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,520
gets in your face okay only telling

1079
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,640
people that are helping you now how does

1080
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,839
that reflect in your sense of values

1081
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,359
with being a guardian

1082
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,740
I am very much of the opinion that I can

1083
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,200
also serve as an extraordinarily bad

1084
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,640
example

1085
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,540
and so in that way I will say that uh

1086
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,599
for instance I'm involved with an

1087
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,940
activist team called archive team which

1088
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,859
some of you may be aware of

1089
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:24,900
um I create I I was a co-founder of it

1090
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,900
back in you know 2008 2009 it was

1091
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,460
designed to be the group that would come

1092
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,140
in when a website was being shut down

1093
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,780
like geocities or Friendster or or or

1094
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,480
you know hundreds of others and we would

1095
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,460
come in and we would grab a whole copy

1096
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,680
of as much as we could to ensure that it

1097
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,380
would continue and over the years we

1098
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,480
discovered variant responses to a a

1099
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,880
gaggle of nerds hitting every single

1100
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,400
server on a on a system of a shutting

1101
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,339
down service some of it rage

1102
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,680
so we started to implement a policy that

1103
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,759
I called good cop Antichrist

1104
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,339
and so more than once I would come in

1105
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:10,859
blusteringly ruining lives

1106
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,780
and then we had a number of other

1107
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,780
archive team members who were just

1108
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,099
little

1109
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,339
quiet haircutted tie wearing like oh

1110
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,220
yeah Jason's completely off the rails

1111
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,319
maybe we could work with you to quietly

1112
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,240
do this in a thing and they would go oh

1113
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,640
thank this guy

1114
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,160
what is with we don't have any way to

1115
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,559
control him

1116
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,480
he's a loose cannon made of loose

1117
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,540
cannons he's he's killed nine of his own

1118
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,000
men we don't have any

1119
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,980
whatever and then they would say to me

1120
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,079
it's all good Chief and we would get it

1121
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,220
done

1122
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,440
I'm fine with that I'm also fine with

1123
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,020
the idea that

1124
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,240
um you know one of the things that was

1125
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,700
corrupted in in the great April Fool's

1126
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,240
 of the last 20 years was the

1127
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,660
fundamental joy of the discovery of not

1128
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,339
knowing something was happening and then

1129
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,380
finding out it was done

1130
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,260
that is a fundamental human Joy right

1131
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,520
like uh dropping an album right where

1132
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,780
it's like I didn't know you were working

1133
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,520
on an album here's the whole album it's

1134
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,400
right here come enjoy it right uh at the

1135
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,079
great expense of a lot of human beings

1136
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,660
happiness Steve Jobs liked that he loved

1137
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,099
announcing something in the next morning

1138
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,900
it's all waiting

1139
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,780
that Joy of those things happening I

1140
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,119
will have people come to me like Mark

1141
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,059
indicates who have been kind of just

1142
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,059
just obsessing in secret trying to come

1143
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,760
up with things create a viable 1.0 and

1144
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,740
then ask me to be the voice of like

1145
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,599
guess what just happened

1146
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,520
and there has been some amazing things

1147
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,520
from Apple II RPGs all the way through

1148
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,140
to like brand new libraries that

1149
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,740
interpret Morse code from the air or or

1150
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,299
um discovering that somebody has been

1151
00:54:57,299 --> 00:54:59,640
quietly digitizing an entire television

1152
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,559
show that hasn't existed for 30 years

1153
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,140
and there were no recordings of it

1154
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,960
I totally encourage that but I also

1155
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,059
think that I play a part in showing

1156
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,460
people that there's a fundamental joy in

1157
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,680
doing this and representing some example

1158
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,280
even like I said if it's a bad one any

1159
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,380
other questions

1160
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,140
or we I have a question if it was time

1161
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,680
uh I saw your talk last time and touched

1162
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,119
on you know mortality and heart attack

1163
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,099
and whatnot and you've talked a lot here

1164
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,380
about change at Hope and I'm wondering

1165
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,599
about kind of you know the Buddhist

1166
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,460
concept of everything changing and

1167
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,140
decaying and kind of getting used to the

1168
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,460
fact you have to let go of everything

1169
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,559
all the time yeah and you can't hold on

1170
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,900
to things what's your take on that as an

1171
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,220
archivist

1172
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,680
oh life is a lossy format

1173
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:53,099
we live in a world where Decay is the

1174
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,260
natural like the universe is constantly

1175
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,180
trying to break you apart to make you

1176
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,480
into a beautiful James Webb photograph

1177
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,460
like that's what it wants to do and it's

1178
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,760
only through variant amount like I I

1179
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,260
started to like come up with different

1180
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,359
ways of psychologically dealing with

1181
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,760
that because I think people have

1182
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,180
discovered in the last couple years last

1183
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,099
couple years have been an astounding

1184
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:19,920
Penalty Box to sit in and stew about

1185
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,900
what we've been doing right

1186
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,020
and one of them was realizing that a lot

1187
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:30,240
of people labor in in in fear and in

1188
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,960
service to a perceived future instead of

1189
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,319
adoring a consistent present

1190
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:41,099
and I'm very much of the opinion for

1191
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,099
instance um infocom great company and

1192
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:46,500
Steve maretsky incredible man who did

1193
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,119
some of the most famous works of this

1194
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,760
game company uh Planet fall Hitchhiker's

1195
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,520
Guide to the Galaxy station fall uh

1196
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,859
leather goddesses of Phobos

1197
00:56:55,859 --> 00:57:00,660
I digitized 8 000 internal memos from

1198
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,940
the company including memos he had

1199
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,880
written about there being too many memos

1200
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,280
and what came out of it was how Steve

1201
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,180
moresky churned every week of the

1202
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,740
six-year main life of infocom into a joy

1203
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:21,480
crab races weird restaurant Traditions

1204
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,079
uh fun games every night board games

1205
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,960
played with like the fervor of Warring

1206
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,400
countries

1207
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,420
he made it that the moments of infocomm

1208
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,599
of going to work and being there were a

1209
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,599
joy to be grabbed every single day

1210
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,119
so even though the company ultimately

1211
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:45,359
fell apart due to various policies and

1212
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,980
approaches that I ended up making a film

1213
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,420
about

1214
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,500
he made those days mean something even

1215
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,599
the building that infocom was in has

1216
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:57,059
been raised in the last 10 years there's

1217
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:58,740
no record of infocomm in a physical

1218
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,020
space there's no plaque there there's

1219
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,940
only the fact that in the minds of a few

1220
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,099
hundred people they remember the

1221
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:06,780
day-to-day office culture that people

1222
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,880
like Steve maretsky brought to their

1223
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,579
daily lives instead of focusing on

1224
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:13,619
whether or not infocom still makes games

1225
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:15,359
or how hard they are to reach or

1226
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,280
anything else

1227
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,020
I think we need more of those kind of

1228
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:19,740
people

1229
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,000
because uh life if you just sit around

1230
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,760
saying well one day I'll do this one day

1231
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,020
I'm going to do this and you don't come

1232
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,059
up with ways to enjoy your day you're

1233
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,079
gonna be

1234
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,119
miserable so that's kind of where I come

1235
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,680
from about that and that's how I come

1236
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,040
and I

1237
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,180
I'm not saying it's not worth it to do

1238
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,760
work in service but like I said with my

1239
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,339
twitch streams I have the experience of

1240
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:47,339
the twitch streams in my endless rants I

1241
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,319
have a podcast that I if you're like new

1242
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:50,220
to this

1243
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,500
I have a podcast

1244
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,319
um I got hit with a 35 000 tax bill I

1245
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,839
don't know how and so

1246
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,280
um to help pay it off I started a

1247
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,839
patreon around a podcast and it was

1248
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:02,520
called Jason Scott talks his way out of

1249
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,280
it in which I tell weird historical

1250
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,040
stories uh for money

1251
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,740
and uh I paid it off

1252
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,900
and I paid off my medical bills and I'm

1253
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,680
debt free and the way I did it was by

1254
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,780
I keep forgetting this is the sad

1255
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,640
country timeline where being out of debt

1256
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,980
is an accomplishment anyway so

1257
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,720
but anyway the point is that what I

1258
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,579
quickly discovered and I've just I've

1259
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:29,460
just finished Episode 205

1260
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,619
is there's something to be said for

1261
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:34,200
giving emotional Tales of what was

1262
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,299
before and finding the connections and

1263
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:39,720
doing that four times a month

1264
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,299
um that's how I found my place so even

1265
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:44,040
though I'm doing all these other insane

1266
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,740
in Infinity works

1267
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,260
the day-to-day considering what I'm

1268
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,180
doing and having to describe it and what

1269
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,339
I'm up to and what those things are

1270
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:56,760
is its own precious Jewel that I will

1271
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,859
polish and work with and have it so I

1272
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,299
encourage that

1273
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:02,400
you know when I first gave these hacker

1274
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,200
con talks they were a lot more up

1275
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,440
and nowadays there are these very

1276
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,900
introspective emotional things and uh

1277
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,760
for the people who used to like the

1278
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,520
weird comedic ones that were odd I'm

1279
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,319
sorry

1280
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,480
there was a talk I gave for the ones who

1281
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,339
don't know called that awesome time I

1282
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:23,520
was sued for two billion dollars

1283
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,040
it's about the time I was you know sued

1284
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,960
for two billion dollars

1285
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,180
and it's it's a fun talk I really

1286
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,520
encourage listening to it but nowadays

1287
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,079
people have the language to understand

1288
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,839
that person who sued me for two billion

1289
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,579
dollars and it's kind of sad at the time

1290
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:40,859
I was grappling with why am I spending

1291
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:42,720
10 years being sued for two billion

1292
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,460
dollars

1293
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,020
um but nowadays

1294
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,640
I'm I'm gifted with the fact that I it

1295
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,500
was so easy to get a talk slot here and

1296
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,760
I didn't have to give them any details

1297
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,960
and they just said do whatever you want

1298
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,799
to do

1299
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,660
that I think of that as a gift that I

1300
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,040
should pay back by giving people

1301
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,140
thoughts and advice and emotion that

1302
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,000
comes deep within me so think about that

1303
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,859
for your talks in the future all right

1304
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:06,180
that's it let's get out of here man it's

1305
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,920
hot
