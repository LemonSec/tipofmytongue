00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
oh

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:42,390

[Music]

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
hi everyone welcome to our next session

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,320
from mind control to mind expansion

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
hacking technology to rebuild our world

10
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,080
um

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
geva and javier uh are gonna

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,000
give us an interactive session uh in

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
which they're gonna use elements of

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
virtual reality brain computer

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
interfaces and ai to applying the hacker

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
the hacker's spirit to it and showing us

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,000
how to use these things in ways that

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
are not really what people expect us to

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
use us so we're going to be hacking the

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
 out of it

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
so a big round of applause to give and

22
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,870
ravier and enjoy the session

23
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,359
[Applause]

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,960
friends hackers it's uh so exciting to

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,479
be here and actually

26
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
uh gathered together for the first time

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
in ages and not a moment too soon

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,840
because

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
i think

30
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
we can all agree that we're sensing a

31
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,760
sense of global system crash here

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
that the engines are turning but things

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
just aren't working that what we're that

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
the um basic props that we are used to

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
holding us up jobs prosperity are

36
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,360
vanishing

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,640
the planet feels like it's in a

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,800
precarious place our technology that's

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
supposed to be running all of this has

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
fundamental design flaws and there's a

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
lack the very technology that we're

42
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
using has brought as has riven engulfed

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
between us that makes it hard for us to

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
find identify and choose responsible

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
leaders and representatives to guide

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
and regulate our growth

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
um

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
we hackers i would argue are in a unique

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
position to do something about this we

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
have a vision we can understand systems

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,680
understand technology we have the skills

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
to analyze and build things we have a

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,280
rich culture of openness and sharing

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
what we need is an actionable plan to

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
leverage our strengths for disruptive

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
change and so i'd like to talk to you

57
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,239
today about fixing society about scaling

58
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,120
our efforts as hackers exponentially

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
the growth hack our impact to all of

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
society because what society is the

61
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
seven billion people it's a total

62
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
addressable market of the billions of us

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
on this planet where we could help solve

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
for the future of work the future of

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
humanity the future of the planet and of

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
course the future will make it all run

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
money we need to reinvent we need to

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
fund society we need to reinvent the

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
economic growth flywheel we need to come

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
up with a new business models new

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,440
revenue models decentralized distributed

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840


73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,440
this i can't do another second of this

74
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,840
[Music]

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
thank you for sticking around we're all

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
worried we get walkouts there

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
um

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
we hear a lot of this sort of thing

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
um

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
that was um

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
i hope it was evident parody um but it's

82
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
all too familiar

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
um right we see this over and over again

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
and if you look at if you look at slide

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
one there

86
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,239
it looks almost reasonable for a minute

87
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
there's things not quite right in the

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,959
world

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
but over and over and over and over

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,439
again

91
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,720
we see people

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,159
standing up and trying to do something

93
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,000
about it nothing ends up going what

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
feels a little bit um off the rails and

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
so what we'd like to do today is kind of

96
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,439
take a step back and and have a look at

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,959
the system in which all of this happens

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
we're used to

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
hacking systems

100
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,519
um we want to have a look at the system

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
the meta system the system that stands

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
above that the system on planet earth

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,800
um and i want to sort of encourage

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
everyone in this audience to develop to

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
open up and develop a mindset of hacking

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
on planet earth hacking on the systems

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,040
that run the systems that we usually um

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
that we usually hack on

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
um

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
and

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
um to do that

112
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
we'll we'll use a number of metaphors

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
that come up often in

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,960
things like this we'll talk about

115
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
systems and machines and so on because

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
they're useful ways of looking at things

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
and because machines and so on tend to

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
be the space where culturally we hackers

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
are supposed to be playing and it's

120
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,800
where we've we're most used to applying

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
a certain kind of mindset i mean a

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
certain set of skills

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,600
um

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
it's a useful metaphor but it's also a

125
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
metaphor that has its limits because

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
machines they tend to be

127
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
it's a word that comes out of the

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
machine age which has been with us for

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
hundreds of years now

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
and has stuck with us well into the 21st

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,400
century and i would argue is one of the

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
reasons

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
that things aren't working quite the way

134
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
we might imagine them to because there's

135
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,840
still

136
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
way too much machine age thinking built

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
into this thing the idea of systems that

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
are monolithic

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
centralized solid they have

140
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
centralized knobs and buttons and an

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
instruction manual and a certification

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
regime before you get to you know touch

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
any of the knobs

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,919
um

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,919
and buttons there's a

146
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,120
there's another metaphor in the way of

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
looking at systems um that we often tend

148
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
to prefer which is networks we often you

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,639
know it's um

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,840
it's it's a space in which we've been

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
playing for the longest time um and we

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
often like to conceive of of complex

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
systems as networks it's a more flexible

154
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
fluid and open

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
um kind of thing um you it's it's more

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
dynamic it's it represents flows it's

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,759
multi-dimensional

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
you can imagine modes inserting

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,639
themselves removing themselves

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
reconfiguring changes

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
and it's a good way of looking at more

162
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
dynamic systems

163
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,319
machine land

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
um absolutely um

165
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,759
absolutely hates networks uh machine

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,840
learn understands machines best which is

167
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
why we've seen this huge effort to turn

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
our networks back into

169
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
centralized machines that's why we have

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
cloud computing it's why we have so many

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
sort of technology affordances given to

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
us through applications that use a back

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
end in a data center somewhere it's why

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
we've seen this pull

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
away from

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,199
um

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
networked way of doing things to much

178
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
more

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
to the original sort of mainframe

180
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,360
um

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
way of doing things so

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
we'll use these two we'll use these two

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,319
metaphors and there's a

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
um and there's a third

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,360
of a

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,639
metaphor that um

187
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,479
um i'd like to introduce here which is

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
the metaphor of a game

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
because if there's one thing we like to

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
do it's we like to play with stuff

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
um

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
all right um

193
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
all right we um

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
just checking to see if there's some uh

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
visuals that go with this but there

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
aren't so we'll just imagine those um

197
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,199
so

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,840
um

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
um

200
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
right so if we um

201
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,319
if we look at the the world as is

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
um what we

203
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,120
what we look at if we can if we can pull

204
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
ourselves out if we can step up and have

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
a look at that at the world from as a

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,280
system if we step out of the usual layer

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,639
that we're used to looking at look at

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
things to layer up is we can see

209
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,840
a playground there we can see so much

210
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
sort of potential

211
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
so many

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
um

213
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
um so many possibilities in the

214
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
resources and the technologies and the

215
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,479
energies that we have

216
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,520
um

217
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
but most of the people playing on the

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
playground are playing a game that just

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,960
doesn't quite seem

220
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
like the sort of game we want to play or

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,840
the sort of game that we want to get

222
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,720
into

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
um and it's the sort of game that's

224
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
heavily one of its defining

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,639
characteristics of the classic game is

226
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
that it's really really optimized for

227
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
high score now scores are useful things

228
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
um scores can be

229
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,199
valuable in their own right there are

230
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
they they if you're

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
sort of adrift in the cosmos trying to

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,159
navigate

233
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
in some way having

234
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,719
dialing in a destination having some

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
measurement of how

236
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,919
close you are to that destination in

237
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,480
some dimension can be can be useful

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
um and a score can be a focusing device

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
and narrowing things down and focusing

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
and attending to a narrow set of things

241
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
is what we do we're constantly

242
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
experiencing reality flooding in through

243
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
all of our senses and we pay attention

244
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,560
to a tiny narrow bit of it and that's as

245
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,279
it

246
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
should be

247
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,480
um

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
but being able to be flexible and shift

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
our attention is also

250
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
vital if you've ever

251
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
flown a plane in dark or in fog

252
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
you have to do it by instruments and one

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
of the first things that you learn is

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
not to pay too much attention to any one

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
instrument to develop a broader picture

256
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
to try and build a picture in your head

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
around these

258
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,360
numbers otherwise you end up you know

259
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,839
flying into the ground um

260
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
and they're everywhere this this this

261
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
scorism this score based mentality is

262
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,959
everywhere i don't know how many of you

263
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,240
have one of these whether it's a smart

264
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,279
watch or a

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
fitness tracker or a smart ring or some

266
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,080
other

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
self-quantifying device and they're

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
amazing they literally

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
shine a light

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
into our inner workings

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,480
and show us something that's going on

272
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
inside and show us something that

273
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
although we might well have a

274
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,279
ability to to have some physical

275
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
recognition of this we can't always do

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,760
that

277
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,519
these things will will give us give us

278
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
some idea of what's happening with our

279
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
with our bodies rhythms while they're

280
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,839
asleep

281
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,839
um for example what does it do it gives

282
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
us numbers it turns everything into into

283
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,920
raw data it turns our heartbeat our

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,000
respiration into a stream of numbers and

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
it's it's not numbers it's a rhythm

286
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
it's the rhythms of our life

287
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,399
um

288
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,079
and when you compress it down to numbers

289
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
it's a lossy compression

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,959
but then

291
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,880
what tends to happen is those numbers

292
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
rather than deriving meaning from them

293
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
get turned into a score if you ever use

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
that are the apps that come with these

295
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
these things it's all about gamification

296
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
and leaderboards and how well have you

297
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
hit your metrics and what's your bad

298
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,560
body battery doing today

299
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
and it's all about

300
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
someone else's idea of what your rhythms

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
should be and how did i do boss is it

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,240
bedtime mum do i get a gold star

303
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,160
so

304
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
um you know because some

305
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
authoritative app has decided that this

306
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
is you know

307
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
this is how to interpret these numbers

308
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
this is

309
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,040
what you should be steering towards and

310
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
whilst there are absolutely people in

311
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
society and who

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
whom we should respect we should respect

313
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
everyone for their whatever knowledge

314
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,519
and insight and discoveries they've made

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,640
and we should

316
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
pay attention to people who've gone

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,959
before in directions we want to go

318
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,320
elevating

319
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
um

320
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
you know elevating people to a position

321
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,440
of authority making them authorities

322
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
giving them authority over us

323
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
um becomes very problematic and scores

324
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
are a lovely way of finding those

325
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
because you you get the leaderboard that

326
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
shows you who's doing well at the things

327
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
you think you want to do well at and

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,200
it's very easy to go from a leader board

329
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
to leaders what should i do

330
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
tell me o guru oh lord

331
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
and once we're following a leader we're

332
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
now a team it's now a team game and a

333
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,040
team score

334
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,639
and

335
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
once we've got that it's best to have an

336
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
opposing team or at least something to

337
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
oppose a war on cancer a war on drugs

338
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
the war on drug users

339
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,279
which perhaps gives us a little less

340
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
cancer but gives us a whole lot of

341
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
scorched earth

342
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
in in the process

343
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,360
and see this

344
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,599
[Music]

345
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
and this is this is what you get

346
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,079
when you end up with a system that's

347
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,839
completely obsessed with score this some

348
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
of you may have seen is a video

349
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,480
um from some research that openly i did

350
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,360
in which they trained um an ai a

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
reinforcement learning system uh to play

352
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
a boat racing game

353
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,639
um and had it optimized for score that

354
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
was the reward function that was that

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
was the thing that told it how well it

356
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
was doing and so it did and it found

357
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,639
an ideal way found a hack arguably to to

358
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
to maximize its score by going round and

359
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,399
round in circles getting absolutely

360
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
nowhere burning a whole lot of up

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
um

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
and getting and getting scores

363
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
20 to 30 percent better

364
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
than the best human players who were who

365
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
were you know trying to actually finish

366
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,839
the race

367
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,040
um

368
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
and this is what tends to happen um and

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
the problem is

370
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,240
um that in

371
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,959
reality the things we burn up don't

372
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,839
respawn um

373
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,279
indefinitely and so we always have to

374
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,560
bring these things

375
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
back to reality

376
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,440
um and there's a huge connection between

377
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,800
these scores in reality because these

378
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
scores traditionally the ones in society

379
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,160
have mattered if you don't get a good

380
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
enough score

381
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,079
you don't accumulate enough if you don't

382
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
get enough social capital if you don't

383
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
score well on these boards you end up

384
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
starving or lonely or dead or wishing

385
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,199
you were dead

386
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,480
so historically the stakes have been

387
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,639
huge have been huge an individual level

388
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
at a societal level they've certainly

389
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
felt like it and that idea is baked

390
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
into the system

391
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
um

392
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
but

393
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
that's a particular view it's a

394
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
particular view of reality that seems

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,839
more and more detached from it in an era

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
we seem to have in some dimensions too

397
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,240
much

398
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
rather than too little

399
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,120
so

400
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
um

401
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
so it's time to do something that again

402
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
i think hackers are naturally very good

403
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
at which is um which is questioning

404
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839
consensus reality and going well hang on

405
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,040
um

406
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
this thing that you have doesn't seem to

407
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,160
work

408
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
um

409
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
quite the way you think it does this

410
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
thing that you this this system of yours

411
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,639
seems to be broken in ways that you

412
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,959
aren't even aware of but also the system

413
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,320
of yours has capabilities and

414
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
possibilities you can do things

415
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,399
that are outside of your instruction

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
manual and potentially

417
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,959
way more interesting

418
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,480
so

419
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
um

420
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
we can do the same thing with

421
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
consensus reality as a system because

422
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
consensus reality at this point

423
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
really has its problems yes it gives us

424
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,279
vaccines in the eiffel tower and

425
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
whatever music

426
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,959
moves your soul but it also gives us

427
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
civil wars it gives us doom scrolling

428
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
and it gives us

429
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
a mechanism where in supposedly well-off

430
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,839
parts of the world

431
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,720
supposedly prosperous people

432
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
spend over a hundred thousand hours of

433
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,680
the most precious parts of their lives

434
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
um

435
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
doing doing things for other people's

436
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
purposes um you know because of this

437
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,240
this need to constantly generate score

438
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
now

439
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
so if we

440
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
one step away from that and reimagine it

441
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
what do we do we could

442
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
um

443
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,959
you know conceive of some alternate

444
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,399
reality but alternate realities have a

445
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
few problems one they sound science

446
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
fictional it's something that isn't here

447
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
right now

448
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
um

449
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
the other problem is if you if you're

450
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
opposing yourself as an alternative

451
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,519
to something

452
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,800
then you're you're letting that

453
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
something shape you as well as sort of

454
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
negative space if you're saying well we

455
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,839
don't want to do that we want to avoid

456
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
that thing and in those circumstances do

457
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,120
we want to look like that you're shying

458
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,959
away from things and you're constricting

459
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,320
your movements in the same way that your

460
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
movements are constricted if you buy

461
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,199
into the thing your movements are

462
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
constricted if you avoid the thing

463
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
so

464
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
um

465
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
so all right so how about virtual

466
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
reality let's start with a complete

467
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
blank slate and build up something that

468
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
we can see

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
probably that

470
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,399
problem with building something from

471
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
scratch apart from the difficulty and

472
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
finding somewhere to do it

473
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
is that you have to have a very if you

474
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
want a really complete open world we

475
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
want something that has affordances in

476
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
it for a wide range of people and gives

477
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,720
us all

478
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
the sort of things that we really look

479
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,959
for in life

480
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,959
and that's very hard to do from scratch

481
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,399
and it's impossible

482
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,320
to get right nobody can build such a

483
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
system

484
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,199
you know

485
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,560
even if it were physically possible

486
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,199
getting it right we've seen from smaller

487
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,320
experiments out in the world that

488
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
getting that that's

489
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
planning everything out centrally like

490
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,120
that

491
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
never never quite works so so much for

492
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,959
virtual reality what about augmented

493
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,560
reality what about

494
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400
taking what we've got taking the society

495
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
that we have and adding

496
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
sort of layers to it um adding

497
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,839
shiny new bits sticking out the side um

498
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
adding sort of overlay networking

499
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
because we're good at that we do we do

500
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,039
overlay networks all the time we take

501
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,160
some infrastructure we take some

502
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
mechanisms up there and say oh we could

503
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
do encrypted communication on this we

504
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,119
could we could build a distributed

505
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,640
currency out of this we could build a

506
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
file sharing network out there and build

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,079
these overlay networks that add this

508
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
sort of extra functionality so there's

509
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
that

510
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
augmenting existing reality in some way

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
um

512
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
but

513
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,520
as soon as we speak of augmenting it

514
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
we're talking about taking what's there

515
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,080
and and making the edges softer making

516
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
it a little bit shinier opening it up a

517
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,679
little bit we're still again constrained

518
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,840
by what's there

519
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
um and what's there and we've seen again

520
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,679
history has shown us time and time again

521
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,760
that the the the mechanism the the

522
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
evolutionary mechanism that's that's

523
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,679
that's propelled this system forward is

524
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
outstanding at taking

525
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
augmentations taking things that stick

526
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
out a little bit and pulling that inside

527
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
using that energy to feed more of the

528
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
same

529
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
[Music]

530
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,640
look at what powers

531
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
all of these

532
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
sort of regressive quote-unquote tech

533
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
systems

534
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
um that we see right now it's open

535
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
source right open source powers the borg

536
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,280
um the system is excellent at pulling in

537
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,039
these augmentations and realigning them

538
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
to its own end so that doesn't quite do

539
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
it either

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
so then

541
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
um

542
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
so then we come to the

543
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
possibility

544
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
of switching buzzwords switching things

545
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
a little bit of extended reality um

546
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
if we use those words not in the

547
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
buzzwordy way but we think about them

548
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
literally as the words that they are

549
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,570
that idea of extending

550
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,080
[Music]

551
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
reality

552
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
so

553
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,919
what that does is it acknowledges what's

554
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,840
there

555
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,280
already but but it allows us to open up

556
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
the space we say

557
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
well what can we what can we build out

558
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
here

559
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,919
that opens up possibility space

560
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,039
that doesn't

561
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
attempt to

562
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,080
oppose that world

563
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
it doesn't attempt to ignore that world

564
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
there's an attempt to overthrow that

565
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
world we're not looking to try and grab

566
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,320
the steering wheel because we could

567
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,919
steer that thing better again we've

568
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
learned that never works

569
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
and we're not looking to burn that world

570
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
to the ground

571
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
for a few reasons there's there's

572
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
there's valuable things in there yes we

573
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,280
can see there's a whole lot of waste

574
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
there's a whole lot of misdirection

575
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,760
there's a whole lot of everything we

576
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
don't want to be caught by the sunk cost

577
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
fallacy here

578
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,400
um

579
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,679
but neither do we want to burn it all

580
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
down because that's extra wasteful and

581
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,919
also

582
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,840
billions of innocent civilians live in

583
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,399
that world

584
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
so instead

585
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
we're we're we're constructing

586
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,559
we're visualizing and constructing new

587
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,919
elements of

588
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,679
reality

589
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
that connects to

590
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,919
that that borrow from that interoperate

591
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:56,880
with

592
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
the reality that's there an idea

593
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
again that's very central to a lot of

594
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,799
what we do of adversarial

595
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
interoperability

596
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,080
of there's something in there that has

597
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,240
functionality that we'd like to use a

598
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
little differently to the way we're

599
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
quote unquote supposed to that we'd like

600
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
to use in our own terms rather than the

601
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
terms and

602
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
of the terms and conditions

603
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,679
you know

604
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
um we do this and we build out

605
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
this is already happening some of you

606
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,000
may be seeing this space some of you may

607
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
be working in this space that there's

608
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
um there's little dots starting to form

609
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
out of

610
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
um many of the resources and

611
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
technologies and things in that system

612
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,799
but out here in in in possibility space

613
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,679
drawing from linking from connecting to

614
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
um

615
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
the systems the systems that are there

616
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
in ways

617
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,559
that work in this larger space not in

618
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
ways that are necessarily consistent

619
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
with the system as it's been and they're

620
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
people who are starting

621
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
to be able to move and live and do

622
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
things in in a wider space and starting

623
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
to bring

624
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
other people

625
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,080
with them so what does this mean

626
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,400
in practical terms and um

627
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,159
you know this is all very sort of airy

628
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,360
theory what does this mean in practical

629
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,039
terms if if you if you you're sitting

630
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,039
here and you're sensing something

631
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,760
you know several things that's that's um

632
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
um perhaps you'd like to see

633
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
um differently in the world

634
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
um and you have some connection or

635
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,520
attraction to them but you don't really

636
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
know what to what to do with this and

637
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,440
how does this whole

638
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
sort of image

639
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,360
um help you and to make it a little bit

640
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,200
more concrete um

641
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
i think it helps make it a little bit

642
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,720
more personal and start with you

643
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
um because to to understand

644
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
where it's possible to move and where

645
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,360
it's possible to go

646
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
um for yourself

647
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,320
and

648
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
you're the sort of expert on that and if

649
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
you do that if you

650
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
figure out where you're standing in all

651
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
of this and what you're doing in all of

652
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,000
this

653
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
then in figuring out how to move from

654
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,240
being

655
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,919
constrained by the system as is to a

656
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,520
more natural position whatever that

657
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,720
means for you

658
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
if you solve that puzzle

659
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,919
how do i

660
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,080
loosen these attachments retain those

661
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
connections in ways that are nourishing

662
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
and helpful to me and operate in a wider

663
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,360
possibility space if you do that then

664
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,640
you open up the space for everyone

665
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
you've pulled the space with you and

666
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,760
you've opened it up for everyone

667
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
standing next to you and you've created

668
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
if you like a sort of proof of concept

669
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
right we love proof of proofs of concept

670
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,280
you're like somebody discovers a way to

671
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,559
do something and

672
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,039
demonstrates how to do it in some small

673
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
way and that may not

674
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,159
work exactly for the rest of us but it

675
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
shows that it shows us that it's

676
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,880
possible

677
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,159
and others can build on that

678
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,799
so take a moment to to

679
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,159
like think about

680
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,440
something that's

681
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
that matters to you maybe you're

682
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
concerned about

683
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,799
food systems or something in in in the

684
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,600
way we move move around the planet or

685
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,799
maybe there's something to do with the

686
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,039
way we connect over networks or how we

687
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,400
sustain each other or something

688
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,720
completely different large small

689
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
where you're noticing something that's

690
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
awful where you're sensing something

691
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
that could be

692
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
could be possible if only we

693
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
looked at things or did things a

694
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
different way and where you have some

695
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
pull some connection to that that makes

696
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
you feel like you'd

697
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
like to

698
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
like to sort of act like to somehow be

699
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,280
involved in realizing that possibility

700
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
that you can see even if it's not sort

701
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
of absolutely clear how

702
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
um and let's take a look

703
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
um at the machine again

704
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,280
um

705
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,799
with that in mind

706
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
let's sort of step up and have a look

707
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
at what goes on

708
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
in typical consensus reality and if

709
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
there's things there that we can that we

710
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,559
can borrow if there's things that we can

711
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,159
use on our terms

712
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,880
to make those things um

713
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
to power that possibility so take them

714
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,159
to think about that whatever that thing

715
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,240
might be and situated in space where

716
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
does it where does it sit relative to

717
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,120
the world as is

718
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,400
right now is it something we're quite

719
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
close to something we're far away from

720
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,919
something that's what's well connected

721
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,880
to what's there or something that

722
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
represents something of a break

723
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,880
where are you situated compared to is it

724
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
something you're working on already is

725
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,279
it something you can see at a distance

726
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
but you really don't know

727
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,000
um

728
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
we don't begin to know um how to do

729
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
anything about it

730
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
take the name image and now let's go and

731
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,559
have a look um

732
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,279
at how things typically um work in the

733
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
world and what we see is that there are

734
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
people creating dramatic new realities

735
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
on a regular basis

736
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
and there's a mechanism

737
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,159
for doing that

738
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,799
and if you doubt this if you doubt this

739
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
reality creation

740
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,720
process and the power of this reality

741
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,320
creation machine that's been developed

742
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,600
over there

743
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
ponder this on your way home tonight

744
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,039
in your uber

745
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,440
and ask how a couple of people with my

746
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
some different idea for moving cars

747
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,799
around cities

748
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
got from zero to covering the world in

749
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
the space of about five years without

750
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
actually buying a whole lot of

751
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
vehicles themselves or if you're taking

752
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,919
the subway

753
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,400
watch everyone in their daily devotions

754
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
to one of you know five or so websites

755
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
that give them their view on reality

756
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
and ask how we went from nobody doing

757
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,159
that to everybody doing that in a very

758
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,120
short space of time

759
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
because there's magic here there's

760
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
there's some kind of global growth gun

761
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,840
there's some powerful replicator

762
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,799
mechanism that these mechanisms use and

763
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,559
it's readily accessible there's there's

764
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
a simple there's actually a simple

765
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
password you can use to access it which

766
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,559
isn't written on a post-it note but it's

767
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,480
written on any number of slide decks

768
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,760
that look alarmingly like the one that

769
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,799
we saw

770
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,159
earlier if you haven't seen the password

771
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
before i'll tell it to you you simply

772
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,880
say

773
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
it's uber but for blank

774
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,039
where blank can be anything large small

775
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
absurd doesn't matter as long as it's

776
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
ever so slightly different to something

777
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
anyone else has said before

778
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,200
you take that you show that to the

779
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,279
gatekeepers of the growth gun machine

780
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
you get given the keys

781
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,360
a little bit more complex than that um

782
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
you know so there's there's a few

783
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,320
caveats if you're now looking at your

784
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,000
thing and saying well well if i took

785
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,760
what if we somehow found a way to take

786
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,159
that thing and and propel it through the

787
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,000
global growth gun well there's a few

788
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,760
problems one there's a little bit more

789
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
than a password there's a biometric

790
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
system as well it's a ship biometric

791
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
system um but you have to be able to say

792
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
the password convincingly you have to be

793
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,840
able to say with a straight face

794
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
um and the biometric system like i say

795
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
it's a system so it's used to

796
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,039
hearing that from a certain kind of

797
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
person so it helps if you look

798
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,039
a certain way the ideal

799
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
the ideal person is the sort of

800
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
proverbial mediocre white man

801
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
um preferably wrapping the mediocrity up

802
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
in the certificate from some main brand

803
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,120
university but it's possible to get

804
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,320
around that you might be able to get the

805
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
method acting right one way or another

806
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,440
and utter the password convincingly

807
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,480
enough

808
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
but that still doesn't work

809
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
to take the thing the sort of nascent

810
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
thing that you see and bring it out into

811
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
the world in this in this large and

812
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,520
flourishing kind of way because

813
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,279
the gun only works for a certain kind of

814
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,880
thing you have to

815
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
um

816
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,200
you have to

817
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,039
mold it you have to bend it

818
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,559
um you know there's

819
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,559
into into something that will fit

820
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,480
into that system and you have to then

821
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,679
take the strings they're attached you

822
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,360
have to build it into a thing that will

823
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,000
one way or another

824
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
cause investment money to increase

825
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,880
doesn't have to necessarily make a

826
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
profit uber doesn't

827
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
but it has to somehow grow in some way

828
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,159
that appeals to more investors and

829
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,880
brings in more investment money

830
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
um and that's a massive constraint and

831
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,600
the thing

832
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
that you're looking at probably can't

833
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,039
survive that transition can't survive

834
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,840
being squished even if it

835
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,360
could the growth gun is an incredibly

836
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
crude

837
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,399
kind of replicator it's powerful it

838
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,720
scales things to global proportions you

839
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
know blitz scales them in very little

840
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,720
time at all

841
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,559
but it's a very very crude replicator

842
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,240
and it makes almost exact replicas

843
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,320
so it spreads

844
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,720
indistinguishable grey goo or blue goo

845
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,480
or whatever your corporate brand color

846
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,679
goo is

847
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,320
across the world

848
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,840
that requires everyone to mold

849
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,760
themselves to it that that requires

850
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
everyone to discover that they need this

851
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
thing rather than

852
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
adjusting itself and molding itself to

853
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,080
the needs of different people in

854
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
different places

855
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,039
different times different parts of the

856
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,320
world

857
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
um different backgrounds and so on

858
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
um so again

859
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,399
even if you could ram your thing into

860
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,840
the into the input port of the growth

861
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,799
gun

862
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,640
it's not going to come out

863
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
if it spreads across the world in a very

864
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
satisfying um

865
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
way because what goes into the growth

866
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
gun is is a minimum viable product

867
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,440
that's all that fits that's the term of

868
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,480
art

869
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
in that world

870
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
which is the least possible thing that

871
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,919
could approximate looking like a product

872
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,279
that's not a terrible idea in its own

873
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
right if we translate that into our own

874
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,440
language it's a proof of concept

875
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,039
but no sane person puts a proof of

876
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
concept into a global growth gun

877
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,919
and so it looks at first

878
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
like the global growth gun is

879
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,559
incompatible with sanity

880
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
but if we look at the parts of it we

881
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,399
look at what people are doing with some

882
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,000
of the parts of it outside of that

883
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,679
system

884
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,880
then there's hope there's some very

885
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,640
interesting things

886
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,279
um that we start seeing because

887
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,240
part of what makes that possible is a

888
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,600
whole bunch of technology and it's

889
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
technology it's a certain amount

890
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,840
um

891
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,440
what we essentially have

892
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
um

893
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
is technology that in many cases we

894
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,399
developed um

895
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
right the the the

896
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,039
global growth industry has discovered

897
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,440
that digital things can replicate for

898
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
free can be distributed for free it's

899
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
like the sorcerer's apprentice

900
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,279
discovering magic

901
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,520
using it to serve some banal end and

902
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
things get completely out of control

903
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
it's magic that we understood

904
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,919
long before it went off in that

905
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,919
trajectory how did we get

906
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,679
from information wants to be free to

907
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,440
that

908
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
um

909
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
you know

910
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,559
um

911
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,399
but the the mechanisms are still there

912
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
and we can we and we know

913
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
better than anyone you know the

914
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,559
possibilities there think of

915
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,120
early file sharing and how that cracked

916
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,440
open cultural transmission

917
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
um because a lot of our cultural

918
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
artifacts could be easily digitized

919
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,600
music and then later movies

920
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
didn't quite get where it could because

921
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,159
um

922
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,000
the system

923
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,880
imposed artificial scarcity through

924
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,320
copyright and so on because those

925
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
systems themselves you look at nap state

926
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,000
it registered itself as a corporation it

927
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
couldn't resist

928
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
taking that form and so there was

929
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,279
something to sue

930
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,320
um

931
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,679
look at

932
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,919
look at uber if you will there's there's

933
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,600
physical things there's human beings

934
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,679
getting into vehicles and

935
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,840
moving around streets and consuming

936
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
energy

937
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
all based on flows of information about

938
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,879
who wants to ride where when

939
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,799
flows of information flow um

940
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,880
you know mapped onto the onto the real

941
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,480
world have enormous

942
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,440
enormous sort of power and loosening and

943
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
unlocking that power has massive

944
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,559
potential

945
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,320
um if you imagine alternative

946
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,000
transportation systems transportation

947
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
systems that open up to more than just

948
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,159
one person one driver one car internal

949
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,080
combustion engine

950
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
if you had that same informational flow

951
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
in a more malleable way in a way that

952
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,559
wasn't

953
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,480
tied to the servers of one particular

954
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
company that has to build things to suit

955
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,120
its business model it's not too hard you

956
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
know it's not too hard to imagine doing

957
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
exactly that

958
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,159
you know in a way that required no

959
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,600
centralized servers no centralized

960
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
middleman removed all of the deadweight

961
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
costs of that monopolist that would be

962
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,279
monopolist

963
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,640
made things better in the immediate

964
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
short term for the for the people

965
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,960
providing those rides and allowed us a

966
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
little bit more freedom of space more

967
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,679
openness to move from that

968
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,279
to a transportation set of

969
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,799
transportation systems that makes that

970
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,120
makes more sense

971
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,159
um

972
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,120
so

973
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
the technology um

974
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,159
um the this ability these this global

975
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,480
nervous system that we have to transform

976
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,720
and shift information to translate

977
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,880
between the world and bits and bits back

978
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,799
into the world is immensely powerful

979
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,559
and we have

980
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,840
a much more

981
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,440
um creative generative view of the

982
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,960
possibilities there

983
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,720
but it still takes it still takes more

984
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
still takes resources of some sort it

985
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
still takes

986
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,880
um

987
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,080
you know whatever you're trying to do

988
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
you can do it in a much more

989
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,840
resource-like way this is one of the big

990
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
sort of insights of the startup industry

991
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
you can have you know half a dozen

992
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,840
people um running a startup and again

993
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,720
scale that up massively without

994
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
building factories or taking on

995
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
inventory or doing the things that you

996
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
traditionally needed to do you can get

997
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,559
very far with comparatively little

998
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,880
but you still need something

999
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,679
and most of the money most of the

1000
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
resources you know tied to money in the

1001
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,080
system that we're working with right now

1002
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
and most of the money is has has strings

1003
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,519
attached

1004
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,320
only there's so much of it

1005
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,279
um

1006
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,559
and so much of it has become an

1007
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,880
abstraction so much of it has become

1008
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
information in its own right flows of

1009
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,679
information flows of utterly money's

1010
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,039
always been a construct but in the last

1011
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
15 20 years or so with the massive

1012
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,399
growth of financialization with the

1013
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,080
massive printing

1014
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
of funny money to keep the party going

1015
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,679
the quantitative easing central banks

1016
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,120
printing money the debt that enables

1017
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
commercial banks printing 10 times as

1018
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,039
much money all of this money flooding

1019
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,200
into the flooding into the world over

1020
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,279
the past 15 years or so that's what's

1021
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,880
enabled

1022
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,399
a lot of the wildness that we've seen

1023
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
all of the the sort of crazy growth gun

1024
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,679
things where you can build a global taxi

1025
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,000
company that loses money for you know 12

1026
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,279
years straight

1027
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,279
and still keep the engine turning

1028
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,000
because there's so much funny money

1029
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,679
and needing a home

1030
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
um for itself it's why we see some of

1031
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,760
the distortions the massive distortions

1032
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,519
that we've seen in the cryptocurrency

1033
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,440
market because it popped its head above

1034
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
ground just in time for all this funny

1035
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,200
money to be looking for an asset class

1036
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,938
[Laughter]

1037
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
yes talk about um artificial scarcity

1038
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,918
right um

1039
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,599
so

1040
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,879
um

1041
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,760
um

1042
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
so there's there's there's massive

1043
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,719
amounts

1044
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
of money

1045
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,839
floating around in this

1046
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,280
that is this is completely

1047
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,359
disconnected from

1048
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,560
conventional

1049
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,639
um reality

1050
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,399
that makes it no less real it still gets

1051
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,040
you still get to turn that into

1052
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,679
vehicles and hamburgers and rent

1053
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,079
and so on and it and and it flows around

1054
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,679
in ways

1055
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,760
that can be quite accessible

1056
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,800
um

1057
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,239
i'll give i'll give you

1058
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,359
i really don't have enough time to get

1059
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,480
in the details here but i'll give you

1060
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,960
one very visible public example

1061
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,280
wall street bets

1062
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
manage to hack

1063
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,040
one of the

1064
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
money flow mechanisms reasonably

1065
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,160
effectively

1066
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
you know whether as a problem

1067
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
take whatever view you like on that

1068
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,760
thing one way or another

1069
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,599
able to shift flows through the system

1070
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,280
using the rules of its system itself it

1071
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
wasn't it was an outstanding hack

1072
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,599
you know it was based on some

1073
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,280
sort of understanding of mechanisms and

1074
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
how they fit together and how if we can

1075
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,599
pull on this mechanism in a certain way

1076
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,720
there's a switch over here when you

1077
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
reach a certain threshold that will

1078
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
force you know hedge funds that have

1079
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,200
taken short positions to close out those

1080
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
short positions and cause flows to

1081
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
happen like this it's a it's a crude

1082
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,839
example but it gives you some

1083
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,760
sense of how in some ways these flows

1084
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,359
are accessible they're more directly

1085
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,960
accessible in the cryptocurrency market

1086
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,240
where you have huge amounts of funny

1087
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
money

1088
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,920
moved around by publicly visible

1089
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,520
algorithm they're visible in other

1090
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
markets derivatives markets and so on i

1091
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
don't have time to go into this here

1092
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,920
we'll happily

1093
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
um

1094
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
discuss this offline with anyone who'd

1095
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
like who'd like to chat about that side

1096
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,350
of things or any of this

1097
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,440
[Music]

1098
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,160
afterwards so

1099
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
we have um

1100
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
technological resources

1101
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,680
um and we have potential access to

1102
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
to directly

1103
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,599
to this

1104
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,680
giant amount of

1105
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
incomprehensible amount these tens

1106
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,079
hundreds of trillions of dollars of true

1107
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,400
funny money detached from anything else

1108
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
floating around the information networks

1109
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,520
of our world in addition

1110
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,560
we have

1111
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,160
mechanisms that have developed

1112
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,440
themselves in the system that we can

1113
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,280
adapt they're they're some they're and

1114
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
they're crude and they're not they're

1115
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
imperfect

1116
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,160
but things around things like

1117
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,720
crowdfunding kickstarter patreon

1118
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,920
um

1119
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,200
and so there are people supporting

1120
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,560
themselves

1121
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,079
in the system that is with with that

1122
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,240
with with money that pays their rent and

1123
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,200
feeds them

1124
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
doing cool projects and making and and

1125
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,680
making youtube videos around them it's a

1126
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
horribly inefficient mechanism

1127
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,599
they have to skew what they do to

1128
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,800
whatever the youtube algorithm

1129
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
wants

1130
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,960
or whatever the youtube algorithm

1131
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,880
decides to advertise advertisers want so

1132
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,520
advertisers pay youtube for eyeballs

1133
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
that the algorithm supposedly delivers

1134
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
to them this video delivers

1135
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,960
convinces the algorithm that's going to

1136
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,720
deliver it enough of the right sort of

1137
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,079
eyeballs for the algor for the

1138
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,079
algorithms and the advertisers and

1139
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,440
eventually through all of this highly

1140
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
inefficient mechanism popular enough

1141
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760
people doing interesting things with

1142
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
enough of a support base of viewers

1143
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
get to do their things and are supported

1144
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,440
somehow by this by this pool of money

1145
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
if you look at all of those

1146
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
inefficiencies and imagine

1147
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,320
smoothing out those inefficiencies and

1148
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,680
removing some of those inefficiencies

1149
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,400
and creating more direct mechanisms

1150
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,040
again it's not hard to imagine

1151
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
you know more people being able to

1152
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
support themselves

1153
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
doing things that are valued by

1154
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
some group of group of others around

1155
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,040
them um even within the sort of

1156
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
mechanisms that we're

1157
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,880
um that we're used to

1158
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,760
um

1159
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
right now so there's um

1160
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,440
there's a great possibility there and

1161
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
there's there's thank you greater and

1162
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,480
greater

1163
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,440
um possibility out here in in

1164
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,640
there's lots of things starting to

1165
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,760
happen in extended reality there's lots

1166
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,440
of there's lots of

1167
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,119
movement and lots of um activity

1168
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,000
taking that view of let's tap into the

1169
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,839
the the power that's there let's tap

1170
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,040
into the resources that are there let's

1171
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,320
do it oh well let's link to that

1172
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
and let's start creating mechanisms that

1173
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,560
open up possibility space

1174
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,400
that reduce the need for those resources

1175
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
that use this power this technological

1176
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
power

1177
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
um this this

1178
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,359
these things that we understand

1179
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,520
um in more efficient ways in ways that

1180
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,599
are more that aren't skewed to a

1181
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,520
particular business model or something

1182
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,000
and where the the logic

1183
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,240
of the old machine system doesn't have

1184
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,480
to apply this doesn't have to yes we

1185
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,079
would like it to be sustainable yes we

1186
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,400
would like it to to spread its influence

1187
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,560
in a positive way as as far as possible

1188
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
and and have some positive influence in

1189
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,000
as many lives as possible

1190
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,680
but it and we wanted to be sustainable

1191
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,440
we wanted to grow in some other sense of

1192
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
the word growth

1193
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,240
wanted to flourish

1194
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,599
but

1195
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,400
we don't have to

1196
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,040
bake in this resource accumulation this

1197
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,680
this investment increasing this business

1198
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
model

1199
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,359
into the thing we can we can find um we

1200
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,240
can very effectively because

1201
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
these things are so cheap and simple and

1202
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
light on their feet to get going and to

1203
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,960
get

1204
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,880
moving if there's enough people energy

1205
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,640
around them

1206
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,720
um there's a whole set

1207
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,280
of new possibilities so um and

1208
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
unfortunately

1209
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,440
the wondrous technology that we have

1210
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,320
um

1211
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,440
seems to have failed us in this

1212
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,520
particular moment so i'm missing a whole

1213
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
lot of

1214
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
visuals and visualizations that perhaps

1215
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
would have made

1216
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
some of this

1217
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,640
even more

1218
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
visual and apparent um to you i've

1219
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,440
covered

1220
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
a lot of fairly

1221
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
high level ground here we do actually

1222
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
have

1223
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,830
um a few minutes left for questions i um

1224
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,280
[Music]

1225
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,359
um so i'm happy to

1226
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,960
um if there are thoughts in your head

1227
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,079
that this is

1228
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,359
um

1229
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,280
sparked off i'm happy to start

1230
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,720
some sort of discussion right here right

1231
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,119
now very happy to

1232
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,119
talk to people afterwards a lot of this

1233
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,280
has necessarily been very handy because

1234
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,640
it covers a fair amount of ground

1235
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,920
there's a lot of

1236
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,599
substance and possibility behind this

1237
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,359
i'm really trying to sketch out the

1238
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,720
territory

1239
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,000
if any of you sort of come away with

1240
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,640
this with sort of energy to to explore

1241
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
this territory to do something in this

1242
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,200
territory to see

1243
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,079
about

1244
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,280
shifting what you're doing into a

1245
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,119
position that's more comfortable for you

1246
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,079
and ultimately more

1247
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,680
valuable for

1248
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,000
society um

1249
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
we're going to be um organizing a sort

1250
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
of ad hoc workshop to discuss these

1251
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,359
things and get together

1252
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
um and look practically at some of these

1253
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,480
questions and put people together and so

1254
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,319
on if that's of interest to you

1255
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,599
catch one of us

1256
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,319
after this we don't have a final

1257
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,680
place and time for this but if you give

1258
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
us your contact details

1259
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
we'll we'll

1260
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
get back to you with that and we'd love

1261
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,240
to actually sit down and have a more

1262
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,599
um

1263
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,599
specific productive

1264
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,480
session

1265
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,160
um taking some of these very broad

1266
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,400
wide-open possibilities um and looking

1267
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
at practical ways forward with them

1268
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
because there are many um so that's a

1269
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,520
brief overview if anyone has any um

1270
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,240
um short um questions challenges

1271
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
anything else you'd like to bring up now

1272
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,079
um that would be great otherwise um

1273
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,920
catch us afterwards and we'll figure out

1274
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,119
a time in place for us all to get

1275
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
together and talk about this in some

1276
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,160
more specific depth

1277
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,399
[Applause]

1278
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,760
all right oh cool all right so i

1279
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,200
appreciate many of the abstract uh

1280
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
many of the abstract examples you were

1281
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,240
giving uh i was wondering are there any

1282
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
particular

1283
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,760
additional authors or works that you'd

1284
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,319
recommend looking into to

1285
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,000
for one to better

1286
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
um

1287
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,680
wrap one's mind around your material

1288
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,440
wow okay that's that's um

1289
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
um

1290
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,240
so yes there are there are there are

1291
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,079
definite um i'm not sure i can stand up

1292
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,400
here um and give you a short list this

1293
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,200
minute but i will be delighted to

1294
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,240
um tap three um send some out um i'll

1295
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,880
tell you what and i think um

1296
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,640
um

1297
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,839
i think

1298
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,119
you want to see these talks are very

1299
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,520
happy you've got some hope talks that

1300
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
that loosely connect to this in some

1301
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,040
interesting ways certainly

1302
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,920
um

1303
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,960
corey doctrine talking about

1304
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
interoperability um he tends to talk

1305
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,520
about that in a specific um internet

1306
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,359
context but idea of interoperability

1307
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,040
though of adversarial interoperability

1308
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,400
of taking something that doesn't want to

1309
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
let you in a certain way and pulling

1310
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,000
something out of it anyway is hugely

1311
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
hugely powerful if you go to that talk

1312
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
and and have him explain as he

1313
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,839
inimitably does

1314
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,680
um what he's seeing in that space and

1315
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,200
just imagine

1316
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,520
take that thought and pull it out beyond

1317
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,880
the sort of internet context more

1318
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,720
broadly um that would be a wonderful

1319
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,920
thing i think that's i think that's

1320
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,800
happening tomorrow um the

1321
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
uh four thieves vinegar collective

1322
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
um spoke i think this morning so it's

1323
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
wonderful that talk but if

1324
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
you were at that or not but it's a very

1325
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,280
very specific thing they're doing

1326
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,599
there's this tiny um collective doing

1327
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,960
really interesting things

1328
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,640
um about taking one of the most physical

1329
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,599
things

1330
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,480
out there um drug delivery

1331
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,680
and finding ways to distribute it

1332
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,760
finding ways to make as much of it as

1333
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,280
possible digital

1334
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,240
um

1335
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,319
um using

1336
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,079
ai effectively fairly old school but

1337
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,960
incredibly powerful ai to take

1338
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,560
drugs that are exceedingly hard to get

1339
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,040
hold of because the law gets in the way

1340
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
patents get in the way outrageous prices

1341
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,000
get in the way find ways to develop

1342
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,079
synthesis mechanisms

1343
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
that allow you

1344
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
to make these at home with ingredients

1345
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,960
you can get from a school science supply

1346
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,520
store in a little bio reactor in a jam

1347
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,200
jar with a few sensors and a basic

1348
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,040
microcontroller in a safe and repeatable

1349
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,160
way

1350
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,760
um

1351
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,680
that it's it's a very specific example i

1352
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,040
think it's an absolutely lovely example

1353
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,400
of some of the things

1354
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,319
that we're talking about here where we

1355
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,520
have these incredibly powerful

1356
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,599
technologies that can take so much of

1357
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,079
this process and make them digital

1358
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,920
and use these things to collaboratively

1359
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,920
with these machines that can search

1360
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,680
millions of science papers and figure

1361
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,359
out how to ask answer questions that

1362
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,800
nobody's asking about how could we make

1363
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,960
this safely at home

1364
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
we can do this as effectively as the big

1365
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
pharma companies do to optimize their

1366
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,200
processes and open this up

1367
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
um to everybody so just off the top of

1368
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,400
my head like two hope talks that really

1369
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,359
kind of resonate with that um

1370
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,880
that comes to mind in terms of books

1371
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,079
something that's like totally

1372
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,359
philosophical

1373
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,640
um

1374
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,920
but um

1375
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,000
resonates with a lot of this um this

1376
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,480
talk um finite and infinite games

1377
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
by james cass

1378
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,640
c-a-r-s-e it's a really short book it's

1379
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,359
a really quick read um

1380
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,800
and um

1381
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,560
it's got nothing directly to do with

1382
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,160
with technology or the specifics or the

1383
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,319
finance world or anything like that

1384
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,400
but in terms of the mindset around that

1385
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,960
um you could do a lot worse than than

1386
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,560
than sit with that book for for a few

1387
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,160
hours and see what it does for you

1388
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,839
excellent thank you very much and i'm

1389
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,520

1390
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,000

1391
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,640
