91

102

an internal memo to facebook employees

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,600
which was then leaked against their will

162
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,199
and ended up making

163
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
international headlines

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,919

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,479
data scientist who's being fired today

170
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
for poor performance

171
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
in practice in the two and a half years

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
i've spent at facebook

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
i found multiple blatant attempts by

174
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
foreign national governments

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
to abuse our platform on vast scales

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
to mislead their own citizenry and

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
caused international news on multiple

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,199
occasions

179
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
i have personally made decisions that

180
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
affected national presidents without

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
oversight and taken action to enforce

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
against so many prominent politicians

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,960
globally that i've lost count

184
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
excerpt 2.

185
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
i consider myself to have been put in an

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
impossible spot caught between my

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,479
loyalties to the company and my

188
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,720
loyalties to the world as a whole

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
there was so much violating behavior

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
worldwide that it was left to my

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
personal assessment of which cases to

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
further investigate to file tasks and to

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,639
escalate for prioritization afterwards

194
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,960
with no oversight whatsoever i was left

195
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
in a situation where i was trusted with

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
immense influence in my spare time

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
excerpt 3 i have made countless

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,919
decisions in this vein from iraq to

199
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,120
indonesia

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
from italy to el salvador individually

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,160
the impact was likely small in each case

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
but the world is a vast place

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,639
although i made the best decision i

204
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,319
could based on the knowledge available

205
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
at that time ultimately i was the one

206
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
who made the decision not to push more

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,759
or prioritize further in each case and i

208
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
know that i have blood on my hands by

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
now

210
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
so with that introduction sophie could

211
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,319
you

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
tell our audience in your own words what

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
was your role at facebook yeah

214
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
absolutely is is this is this plain can

215
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,719
you hear me

216
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,519
yeah

217
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,080
it's good okay great so yeah surgery to

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
talk with everyone thinks this is my

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,640
first hope anyways so um i joined

220
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
facebook in january of 2018. i was fired

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,160
in september of 2020 and i i was a data

222
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
scientist which means things are over

223
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
the place because of the new buzzword at

224
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
facebook it meant basically what's

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
called a data analyst somewhere else you

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,720
look at numbers and tell people what

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
they mean

228
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,720
and i was on the fake engagement team

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
but by fake i mean for instance actual

230
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
fake accounts hacked accounts and that

231
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
will probably not surprise many people

232
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
in the room but there's also a giant

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,519
number of people who

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,200
give their accounts over to nefarious

235
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
bad actors via social engineering to do

236
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
bad things with them so they so we call

237
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
them self-compromised in that they're

238
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
not quite fake but they're inauthentic

239
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
still and by engagement i mean likes

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
commentaries etc and so usually when i

241
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
say this what people immediately think

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,920
of is

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
russian trolls foreign interference

244
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
political activity etc

245
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
but most people are not politicians most

246
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,200
activity isn't able to critical on

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,399
social media

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,040
the vast majority of this activity was

249
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
was not what you would consider very

250
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
important it was more in the spam

251
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,880
category

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,760
within the company organization

253
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
in the sense of something that is vast

254
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
in number not too efficient not too

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
effective in individual cases

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
and so the work that you've heard about

257
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
me doing was a work that i was doing in

258
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
my spirit time essentially

259
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
it was it was work that was close enough

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
to my actual job but would theoretically

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
be left to much more important people to

262
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
take care of

263
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,160
and

264
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
but but in practice those very much more

265
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
important people were under resourced

266
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
and they're supported they worked too

267
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
hard with not enough pay and so there

268
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
ended up being a lot of things that they

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
were not doing simply because they could

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
not do them

271
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
i have the greatest respect for them my

272
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
disagreement is with the people who put

273
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
them in those positions and so

274
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
i found myself increasingly working in

275
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,720
the

276
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
activity in the realm of sophisticated

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
political activity even though it wasn't

278
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,600
quite my remit the analogy here would be

279
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
say

280
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
a new police woman hired in dc

281
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,360
who has told you how to handle robbery

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
and theft in dc by which the police

283
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
chief means shoplifting pre-snatching

284
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
and she does that but she also works in

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
his spare time to track down a mass-safe

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
greu ransomware operation attacks into

287
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
dc hospitals to demand the residency of

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
their money which is technically still

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
maintenance in dc but not exactly what

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,640
you would expect it to do and so

291
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
that's basically what i was doing

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
okay

293
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,839
so in the course of your work as a data

294
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,760
scientist what did you find

295
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
absolutely

296
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
so

297
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
so

298
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
i eventually i eventually caught for

299
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
certain to tune to foreign national

300
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
governments red-handed that were abusing

301
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
facebook and vast scales without even

302
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
trying to hide it too many their own

303
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
citizenries

304
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
these these were in these were

305
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
specifically the president of honduras

306
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
and the gov and the ruling political

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
party of azerbaijan

308
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
i mean

309
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,399
on the

310
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,760
on the arrests

311
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
went through a deeply disputed election

312
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,800
in 2017 that resulted in soldiers being

313
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
sent on the streets to street syrian

314
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
protesters after the police went on

315
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
strike and refused and this year

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
actually the now former honduran

317
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,639
president was extradited to here in new

318
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,639
york city in fact where he is now on

319
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
trial for smackdown drugs to the united

320
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
states to finance his presidential

321
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,359
campaign great person

322
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
and meanwhile azerbaijan is officially a

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
democracy it's so democratic that in

324
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
2013 they managed to accidentally

325
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
release presidential election results a

326
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,920
day before the actual reduction

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
and so

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
and so i mean

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,160
it's not too surprising that bad people

330
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
would seek to abuse platforms in bad

331
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
ways

332
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
what distinguished this was that i mean

333
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
these were latent foundations of

334
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,639
facebook's rules in terms of services

335
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,959
and when i first saw this i was very

336
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,519
naive instantly i thought well i found

337
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
this or just either the authorities are

338
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
handed over they take care of it end of

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
story which i mean

340
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
i was never a security researcher maybe

341
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,440
that shows

342
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
and

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
and so in practice it was the start of a

344
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,760
two years as a fianno ordeal i mean

345
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
the way i would describe it is that

346
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
everyone agreed it was terrible no one

347
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
agreed it was terrible enough to be

348
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
their problem for their job or what to

349
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
do about it

350
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
and so in the end it took almost a year

351
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,839
for them to act in the case of honduras

352
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,600
after i caught them right-handed it took

353
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
more than a year to act in the case of

354
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,600
azerbaijan in both cases they came back

355
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
right afterwards the government advised

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
by zhang is still happily active on

357
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
social media today

358
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,279
but face i mean facebook is a company

359
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
they don't really care

360
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
and for people who aren't already

361
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
familiar with the documents you leaked

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
what exactly were these governments

363
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
doing that was

364
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
unethical

365
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
essentially these governments that were

366
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
using were using were using were using

367
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
fake social media

368
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
assets on vast scales to impersonate

369
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,079
their own citizens and pretend to be

370
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
their own citizens that supported

371
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
themselves and opposed the opposition

372
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,519
i'm going to

373
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
i'm going to use azerbaijan as example

374
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
so this so they had maybe 10 10 000 fake

375
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,279
assets my guess is maybe i mean i don't

376
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,320
actually know how many people were

377
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,399
involved because you can't pin fake fake

378
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,079
fake facebook accounts to these many

379
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
people but my guess is a thousand or so

380
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,320
they were creating comments on vast

381
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
scales and they were writing

382
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
each each month they wrote three million

383
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,120
individual unique comments oh about how

384
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,639
the how they were great the opposition

385
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,240
were terrible and anyone who opposed

386
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
them were western spies or traitors etc

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,680
and so these co and and so every time

388
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
anyone posted about the opposition in

389
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,519
azerbaijan anytime someone discussed the

390
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
opposition and even time a foreign news

391
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
source such as bbc azerbaijan voice of

392
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
america azerbaijan the radio for europe

393
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,639
as you begin any of them discuss the

394
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
opposition they would be immediately

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,639
deduced by a thousand great comments

396
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,160
about how they were traitors to the

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,839
country and azerbaijan did not need

398
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
western democracy in the things of that

399
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,839
note which i'm sure must have had a

400
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
quite a chilling effect

401
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and

402
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,519
i mean people in this audience may be

403
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
thinking well they should have just have

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
quit facebook but i mean the thing to

405
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
realize is that in countries like

406
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,199
azerbaijan there's no independent media

407
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,240
system

408
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,199
i mean

409
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,720
i think every independent media in

410
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
azerbaijan has been kicked from the

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
country and it's basically foreign now

412
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,240
it's just in terms of ex we've been

413
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
exiled essentially

414
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,639
and and the opposition really relies on

415
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
social media for what it's worth uh

416
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,279
because it's better than

417
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
state-controlled media which is even

418
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,399
worse

419
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,560
like when i came forward with

420
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
with my findings and neither by john i

421
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
was quite frankly a bit surprised at

422
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
first by what's the

423
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
as every political leader annie karimly

424
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
who was what the main target of this

425
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
harassment campaign said because i would

426
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
have expected him to say something very

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
harsh on facebook but instead he said

428
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,079
something very even-handed he said

429
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,519
something like and then paraphrasing

430
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,720
from memory

431
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,880
i mean if

432
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
facebook offers an important tool to the

433
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
very opposition to get our message out

434
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
and connect in a way that isn't

435
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,079
affordable in

436
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
in government media i mean i thank mark

437
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,000
zuckerberg for making facebook but he

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
should hire someone who speaks cesari

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
or something like that he was very he

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
was he was very polite and frankly nice

441
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
about it because he could not afford to

442
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
alienate mark he couldn't afford to do

443
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
facebook because the alternatives were

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
even worse

445
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
and i think that's something that we in

446
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
the vest of sometimes lose sight of it's

447
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
easy to say no one should use facebook

448
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,399
but i mean the alternatives can often be

449
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,320
worse

450
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
so go back a bit as to what these

451
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,759
governments were doing they were

452
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,160
creating fake assets and to most people

453
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,759
in the audience you might think of that

454
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
as fake facebook accounts right like

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
making accounts for you know users who

456
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,600
don't actually exist

457
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
uh and i was kind of interested to learn

458
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
that that's not what they were doing

459
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
because facebook does sort of uh limit

460
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
how many of these like fake user

461
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
accounts you can create so instead they

462
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,560
used a loophole where they made fake

463
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
facebook pages which facebook limits

464
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,519
much less and they were able to use

465
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,720
those pages to create likes posts

466
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,480
comments that look like they were from

467
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
real users but were actually from these

468
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
like you know you call them inauthentic

469
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,040
assets so has facebook done anything to

470
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,799
solve that problem or have they just

471
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,959
left that loophole open

472
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,559
i mean it was still active when i left

473
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
the company as far as the member is

474
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
still active today it i mean still

475
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,240
definitely being used by the government

476
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
of azerbaijan i required zero they

477
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,679
exploit except by now it's something

478
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,439
like a 1500 they exploit

479
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
i mean so just to back up a bit for

480
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
people who do not use facebook to try

481
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,839
and explain what's going on so i mean

482
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,679
when you use facebook you most people

483
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,200
have an account but there's also

484
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
something called a page which is for

485
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
public facing sense like for instance

486
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,960
hope might have a page on facebook that

487
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
is for the hope

488
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
hacker organization

489
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
conference and then they post here's the

490
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,080
update on the hope conference etc i mean

491
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
joe biden has a facebook page donald

492
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
trump well has a facebook page but it's

493
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
frozen

494
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,440
i mean i mean narendra modi

495
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
the chinese government the u.s

496
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
government etc all of these have

497
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
facebook pages

498
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,919
and that is the intent for facebook

499
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,120
pages and so a single person can control

500
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
a lot of facebook pages for instance it

501
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
might be that your 72 works in the

502
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
government and you control and you can

503
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,679
throw the us government the facebook

504
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
page the white house facebook page and

505
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
the joe biden facebook page i mean this

506
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
is a this because you're hired by them

507
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
to run social media because it's not

508
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,760
actually joe biden who's typing in

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,120
i did so and so too today or et cetera

510
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
and the thing is

511
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
there is no there is no one checking

512
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
that these p that these pages are actual

513
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,520
people i mean i mean there are people

514
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,559
who look that the pages aren't

515
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,400
impersonating anyone important but they

516
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
can make a page that's called joe smith

517
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
and no one vote and give it a name and a

518
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
picture and pretend to be a person and

519
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
they can do things with it then no one

520
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
will and no one will stop me from doing

521
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
it

522
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
i mean i try to make it a bit more

523
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
difficult but i got a lot of push back

524
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
and and facebook has made it a lot

525
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,520
easier for pages to do things because

526
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
the pages growth team is like yay that

527
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
increases on numbers and makes people

528
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,760
use pages more and so here's a fun fact

529
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
that i was shocked when i discovered it

530
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,120
of facebook activity by pages globally

531
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
worldwide at

532
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
three percent of activity from pages on

533
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
on on posts by other pages were from

534
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
this very network by the library

535
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
government worldwide and so somewhere in

536
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
facebook i'm sure there's a team that's

537
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,080
very proud of their numbers and very

538
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
surprised when it went temporarily down

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
in in

540
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
late november in late october november

541
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
2020 when i got this taken down briefly

542
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
post my departure and they came right

543
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,160
back

544
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,280
but i mean

545
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
i mean ultimately that's

546
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,120
that's what happens when you have an

547
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
organization that focuses on numbers

548
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
rather than what's actually important

549
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
okay

550
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,760
so in your work as a data scientist what

551
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
did you look at to determine that these

552
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
were how did you find out this loophole

553
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,039
was being exploited basically

554
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,400
in that specific case it was very sunday

555
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,120
so

556
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
i so so at the start i was so at the

557
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
start

558
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
and so at the start

559
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
i was just looking into fake likes etc

560
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
in specifics things that were not too

561
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
imp too important and i was and

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
this was a very new team i think it was

563
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
the second or third person to join and

564
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
right right when i was hired

565
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
and and so i took about to get on the

566
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
ground i started looking into how this

567
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
was being used in politics

568
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,240
and so and so i looked for intersect we

569
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
we had a database of activity we

570
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,480
believed was fake we also had a database

571
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
of activity we think is political

572
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
because the political team does that and

573
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
so i think okay i'll union these two

574
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
databases and see what i got i'm curious

575
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
and so i got activity i got activity in

576
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
india i got activity in indonesia

577
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,039
renamed what we would call the global

578
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,400
source

579
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
and i was putting together a report for

580
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,919
leadership on the rest was one of these

581
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,440
cases actually the only ring president

582
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
was the only one involved and i was

583
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
putting together a presentation for

584
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
leadership to tell them this is bad and

585
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
we should do something about it and then

586
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
i was i was just opening the honorable

587
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
president's

588
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
page and clicking on who liked him so he

589
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
could get a screenshot for powerpoint

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
that's all i was doing and i saw wait

591
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,960
this is weird because all these people

592
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
who are liking him aren't people they're

593
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
pagers this is really silly

594
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
it would be like it would be like i

595
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,039
don't know you walk into a normal prison

596
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
conference and everyone has pink hair

597
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
i don't know i'm not great at my

598
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
analogies

599
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,080
yes i mean i said a normal person

600
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
conference

601
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
sorry apologies to everyone here

602
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,559
you know like a fancy corporate

603
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,919
conference and everyone has pink hair

604
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,320
that would be a bit weird

605
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
and so

606
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
and so anyways i looked more into that

607
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
and then i was like wait

608
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
is no one paying attention to this well

609
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
i guess it's the next zero day exploit

610
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
and i was like okay this is very obvious

611
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
we'll close this loophole it was not

612
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,600
that obvious i was very naive instantly

613
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,840
and and but i mean

614
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
that was dramatic because that was just

615
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
dramatic and cindy case it was easy from

616
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
the start because like they didn't even

617
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
bother to hide because usually in like

618
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,559
hacking

619
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
in hacking like you want it's hard to

620
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
attribute attribution you don't know

621
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
who's responsible in this case if the

622
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,760
equivalent of some if someone hacking

623
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,159
your database and lined and and left the

624
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,840
file signed with the private signed with

625
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
your private key saying i did it or

626
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
something so so you're saying that these

627
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
facebook pages which were liking the um

628
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
azerbaijan or honduras you know

629
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
president's post were are were they just

630
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
literally being run by real facebook

631
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,679
rights that belong to politicians in the

632
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,240
government in this case there were 200

633
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
fake facebook pages that was run

634
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
literally by the page administrator of

635
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,919
the on durian president was given

636
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,760
special access to like post on his

637
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
behalf i mean like usually you have to

638
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
be careful this was they didn't bother

639
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,360
to be careful because they were so

640
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
blatant and

641
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
they attended then karen weren't afraid

642
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
like

643
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
i'm not i'm not a super genius i had no

644
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
super i know special training like

645
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,880
i had no special training i'm not a

646
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
super genius i've met super geniuses i'm

647
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,799
not one of them and i still caught two

648
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
national governments red handed and

649
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,280
that's not because i had anything

650
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,799
special it's because no one had bothered

651
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
to look for them before because anyone

652
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,960
who could have could have found result

653
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
so you said that facebook has not yet

654
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
closed this loophole so

655
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,000
i mean i assume that means their

656
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
response to you finding this was just

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
you know shrug or like what was what did

658
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
they do what happened after you told

659
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
them i mean the way we describe it is

660
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,960
that everyone agreed that it was

661
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
terrible and no one agreed on what the

662
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
correct solution was whose job and more

663
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
importantly whose job it was

664
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
i'm going to use an analogy

665
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,279
so i mean here in the u.s there are

666
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
unfortunately a lot of mass shootings in

667
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
the u.s

668
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
after each match shooting there is

669
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
absolutely no one who says my shootings

670
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,480
are great my shootings are okay

671
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,799
what happens instead is that everyone

672
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,640
agrees that match routines are terrible

673
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
but people don't agree on whose job it

674
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
is to fix it what the correct solution

675
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
is some people say we need more guns and

676
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
iron society is a polite society some

677
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,120
people say we need fewer guns we need

678
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
gun control some people say the correct

679
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
answer is thoughts and prayers and so

680
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,919
that's the only thing that happens in

681
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,600
the end

682
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,640
and so

683
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,440
like i i talked beca i mean i don't

684
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
blame the individual people like if

685
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
someone if if if you are

686
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,279
if you were working in the right-hand

687
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,520
office space and someone who's not on

688
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
your team who's lower level than you

689
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
goes up and says hey you should do this

690
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,480
extra work you're not going to be like

691
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
oh great i should do that

692
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
but i mean

693
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,720
so ultimately i blame the leadership who

694
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
should have found someone to put this

695
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
aside

696
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
but

697
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,120
and

698
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
yeah like i i tried to get i tried to

699
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
get pagers to online

700
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
they didn't think it was a problem i

701
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
tried to get news feed i tried to get

702
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
i tried to get social active violence

703
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,440
strategic response civic integrity

704
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
all these names that mean absolutely

705
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,159
nothing to these people in this room but

706
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,919
our different facebook teams

707
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
and all of them agreed it was terrible

708
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
and not the problem

709
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
and so

710
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
eventually i found out that the best

711
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
solution was not to was not to go

712
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
through the proper channels but to make

713
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
noise internally because i mean

714
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
so facebook has facebook the product and

715
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
it also has something called workplace

716
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,919
which is basically facebook inside the

717
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,400
company and an employee could make posts

718
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,480
inside workplace and hope it goes viral

719
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
and so that's what i did and eventually

720
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
one of them got viral and they got

721
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,720
people to be like wait what the are

722
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
we doing and then

723
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
and that caused enough pressure for

724
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
people to actually to act a tiny bit

725
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,919
and so

726
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,360
that was my great brilliant message to

727
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,440
getting changed i mean i also got pushed

728
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
back like i got i i got pushed i got

729
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
criticized by a company vice president a

730
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
few times

731
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
for instance like i'm super i'm super i

732
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
was super dope i was literally went

733
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720
overboard with new hire straight out of

734
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,159
college so

735
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,440
i shouldn't have been interacting with

736
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
him in the first place but

737
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,559
my life got very weird around that point

738
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,919
so what about

739
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,679
the consequences of you coming out

740
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
publicly with this has this put any pr

741
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,240
pressure on facebook to start fixing

742
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
these issues you know perhaps hiring

743
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,840
more people to work on these problems

744
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,279
like literally to me it sounds like

745
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,520
there was just you looking at this in

746
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
your spare time when you know a company

747
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,200
of that scale should have

748
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,279
multiple employees perhaps even teams

749
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,360
and investigating this kind of activity

750
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,679
especially yeah in political situations

751
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,279
so i do want you to take a step back and

752
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,200
address the larger question of who works

753
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
on this and why didn't they work on this

754
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,039
so there's a team that's cut threat

755
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
intelligence that in theory should work

756
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
on this they put out immensely

757
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,799
coordinated inauthentic behavior reports

758
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
like you might have heard of them

759
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,080
putting out reports when they took about

760
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
russian interference or etc

761
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,200
or about for instance the uh

762
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
tp usa associate radio forge was writing

763
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
fake accounts in mid 2020 you might have

764
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,320
heard of that when it was taken down

765
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
and they're they're very insulary team

766
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,720
very secretive and many of them might

767
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,799
think former cia's books were such a

768
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,960
highly trained and they're also very few

769
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
and work way too hard

770
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
and the general organization contains a

771
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,320
lot of similarly important people like

772
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
for instance espionage which alerts

773
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
people hey there's a foreign spy who's

774
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,440
looking at your facebook profile you

775
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,039
might want to know that

776
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,440
and so but and so in theory they should

777
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
be their job

778
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,520
in fact in practice in my experience

779
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
they they folk i mean

780
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
they tend to focus reactively on what

781
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,360
gets attention

782
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
in the sense because usually facebook

783
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
responds to cases when they come from

784
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
outside the company when it's there's a

785
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
foreign ngo when there's a political

786
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,799
party that says hey this looks weird

787
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
when the media reports something really

788
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,559
strange is going on then facebook looks

789
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
into it because there's people outside

790
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,399
the company who care and can hold

791
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,880
facebook responsible and that can

792
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
cause facebook to get bad news reports

793
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
and that will affect the ability to make

794
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
money

795
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,480
in contrast i was an employee who went

796
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
out and found this on my own completely

797
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,200
proactively without anyone outside the

798
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
company to hold them responsible in

799
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
theory my loyalty was to the company i

800
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,159
mean i i kept trying to use arguments

801
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,840
like well this is so obvious eventually

802
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
someone will notice and and if they do i

803
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,760
mean

804
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,600
if it ever facebook has so many leaks if

805
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,960
it ever gets all that we said on this

806
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
for you it would look terrible we got

807
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,240
killed in the press and this became a

808
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,000
self-fulfilling prophecy because i was

809
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
the one who leaked it but we didn't know

810
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
that at the time

811
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,039
but i mean the point i'm trying to make

812
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,640
though is that

813
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,120
like ultimately facebook is a company

814
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
we don't expect philippe morris to go

815
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
out and have a special division that

816
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
reimburses medicare whenever someone

817
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,559
gets lung cancer

818
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,360
or

819
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,720
have a special division that tries to

820
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
make cigarettes that's addictive it

821
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
would frankly not be very

822
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,000
effective if that were the case they

823
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
would say okay that's nicotine

824
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
cigarettes that's et cetera and people

825
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,279
would be like no that would cost a

826
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,440
profit margin or whatever

827
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,559
and so

828
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,360
like

829
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,039
and so

830
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,720
and so what i'm trying to say ultimately

831
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,000
is that there were people who were

832
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,919
working on this but because of

833
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,640
facebook's prioritizations they were not

834
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
working on the specific cases they found

835
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
they were not found considered important

836
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
to facebook i was actually told at one

837
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,760
point that

838
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,440
that this work was not considered

839
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,520
important to facebook

840
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
and if it was i should disprove it by

841
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
doing nothing and letting it become a pr

842
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,039
fire so that people would care about

843
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,320
this

844
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
and this sort of logic makes sort of

845
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
sense for other areas such as for

846
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
instance misinformation age speech etc

847
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,200
which are content-based issues in which

848
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
the average person can pay attention and

849
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
come to some conclusion

850
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,919
if someone on the internet says the moon

851
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,600
is made out of cheese and that's not a

852
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
huge deal

853
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
if it if if a politician says the moon

854
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
is made out of cheese and that starts

855
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,399
the giant

856
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,320
internet filled memes with eating the

857
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,919
moon among it's cheese the moon is so

858
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
delicious eaten like a tide behold and

859
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,279
suddenly a giant

860
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,039
crowd storms cape canaveral trying to

861
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,799
hijack a rocket up to the moon to eat

862
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,159
the cheese

863
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,320
i mean i'm using the absolute example

864
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,559
intentionally on purpose i mean the sec

865
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,559
that would be very important and very

866
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,240
bad and it would get a lot of attention

867
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
and the first would be not some random

868
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,159
person doing it would not get much

869
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
retention and so in this case it would

870
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,559
be a decent proxy but the problem with

871
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,480
fake accounts is that the goal is to not

872
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,039
be seen i mean i mean an energy you

873
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,120
probably for many ways if everyone knows

874
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
of a hacker they're probably a bad

875
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,360
hacker who's not good at being hidden

876
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
i mean sorry i mean and as if well not

877
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,000
necessarily i mean depending on type of

878
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
attacker like whitehead is okay i'm

879
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
talking more about the really black hat

880
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
types or like if everyone knows that

881
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,600
someone is a spy they're terrible spy

882
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
and that's his name is james bond they

883
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,399
don't know how james bond does it

884
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,919
yeah and so the point i'm trying to make

885
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,360
is that

886
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
the fundamentally the attention is

887
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,760
misallocated for fake accounts and that

888
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,919
sort of thing people pay attention to

889
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,200
what gets attention that's not

890
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,520
necessarily what's good what's effective

891
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,559
it's what's bad enough to be caught

892
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
and the and so

893
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,159
allocated to the wrong areas and so

894
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
that's this and so facebook pays

895
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,120
attention to the wrong things

896
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
and so there was i was providing

897
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,320
contacts and there was an actual

898
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
question and they forgot your question

899
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
i'm sorry um yeah let me try to remember

900
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
it for a moment i swear i didn't try to

901
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,039
dodge it on purpose

902
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,440
what was my question

903
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
well actually i have a somewhat related

904
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,080
question which is

905
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
you know there's some things which are

906
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,919
easy for third parties like people in

907
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,519
the audience to detect and some things

908
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,760
that are not and really the only people

909
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
who can find it are people who work

910
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,760
internally on facebook which from what

911
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
you've told us sounds like is currently

912
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,919
nobody because you were fired you were

913
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,240
the only person doing it before

914
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,399
it's things like looking at you know

915
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,960
comments or likes on a politician's

916
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
facebook post and seeing if those are

917
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,760
coming from pages if i'm not mistaken of

918
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,080
something that like anyone can do yeah

919
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
it's just facebook has rate limits they

920
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
have probably like anti-scraping yeah i

921
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,279
put measures i put up with the rate

922
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,440
limits myself okay not very effective i

923
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
tried to make i try to make them

924
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
narrower but they didn't but there was

925
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,399
pushback people were like it would

926
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,039
affect our performance okay so i guess

927
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,120
my question is is there

928
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
anything people who don't work at

929
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,559
facebook can do

930
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,919
to help detect this kind of activity to

931
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,600
bring attention to the fact that this is

932
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
happening and put more

933
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
external pressure on facebook to close

934
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,519
these loopholes dedicate more internal

935
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,320
resources to fixing them and so forth

936
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
yeah so i'm going to decompress that

937
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,559
into several parts first is can people

938
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,480
outside detect these

939
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
and the answer is frankly it's really

940
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,559
hard in the same way that

941
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,080
that it's that

942
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,519
i mean because

943
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,799
um

944
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,320
at least

945
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
so i'm not going to go into exactly how

946
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,120
i

947
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,559
caught faker constant governments

948
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,320
because for instance those people will

949
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
also listen to that talk and they tell

950
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,519
them i call them through xyz they will

951
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,240
know not to do x-rays in the future

952
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
but

953
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,679
but very broadly i used metadata on

954
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,519
large levels i know it's unpopular but i

955
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
mean

956
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,679
but ultimately it's in to actually

957
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,000
associate this account with that person

958
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,679
basically this user is based in this

959
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,519
area i mean you have to use metadata on

960
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,760
some level if you want to do any sort of

961
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
attribution

962
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,240
and

963
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
there are things that you can look at as

964
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
as an external researcher but none but

965
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,120
most of them tend to be imperfect

966
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
because in the same way that if if

967
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,200
people in this audience go out and start

968
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
playing it's someone

969
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,399
are there any spies in this audience

970
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,760
let's do a survey

971
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,440
i mean this will not be very effective

972
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
because the goal is to those people is

973
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
to hide and pretend they're not a spy

974
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
and so you see this person's behaving

975
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,799
very unusually actually they're just

976
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,720
sleep deprived because they spent last

977
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,919
night doing hacker karaoke this

978
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
this person is dressed up as a spy

979
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,159
actually they're about on their way to

980
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,120
haku dress-up party i'm

981
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
i don't know

982
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,200
and and so

983
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
it's hard it's it's it's it's almost

984
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,480
impossible to reliably distinguish

985
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
the fake accounts from the real people

986
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,200
that that without internal data

987
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
and that's a lot of the issue at hand

988
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
here that only facebook has its data and

989
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,800
we and and they're not going to give it

990
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,079
up

991
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,960
so in terms of actual paths forward i

992
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,399
mean

993
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,918
i've tried to put public pressure on

994
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
facebook around i have to say by now

995
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,560
it's not very successful i'm aware of

996
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,719
only one change facebook has made since

997
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,199
i left that might be related to me that

998
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,960
change is that they have cracked down an

999
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,320
internal conversation that isn't

1000
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
directly related to work which is

1001
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,440
certainly a change but not one that i

1002
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,879
would necessarily

1003
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,800
recommend or

1004
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
i mean it's not too different from say

1005
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,159
what but the roots did too

1006
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,040
it's to the to to the mass protests with

1007
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
synchronous gaia coming forward and all

1008
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,760
that

1009
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
and so

1010
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,520
and and and so

1011
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,839
like i've testified to a number of

1012
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,320
governments and and

1013
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,720
and and what i and what i advised to try

1014
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,119
and and to type to that gap is to

1015
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
essentially do sort of red team style

1016
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,359
penetration testing that is

1017
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
because because right now you you don't

1018
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,200
even have a good idea it's how does

1019
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,720
facebook do with spots how does

1020
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
traditional response i mean you know so

1021
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,839
but so little about that we can have

1022
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,440
giant arguments about it on twitter's

1023
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
elon musk

1024
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,720
and

1025
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,320
like no one has a knowledge right now

1026
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
besides the social media companies who

1027
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,880
are not going to give that up and so the

1028
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
only effective way i can see it to do it

1029
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,359
is to do red himself penetration tests

1030
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,079
with ideally governments or trusted

1031
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,960
right height organizations that would do

1032
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,839
with two penetration tests you set up

1033
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,920
you set up ten figure 10 networks fake

1034
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,240
accounts on reddit social reddit twitter

1035
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
facebook and then you say facebook

1036
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,760
called 1 out of 10 ready to cut 0.

1037
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
traditional 0. they're all terrible

1038
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
facebook is at least terrible these are

1039
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
made-up numbers of course and you could

1040
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,560
do the same thing with any any other

1041
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
problem on social media in theory

1042
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
for instance p if people you worried

1043
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,760
that my my political philosophy is

1044
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,599
getting censored incorrectly then you

1045
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,760
can make posts that are perfectly fine

1046
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,359
and report them and see how many of them

1047
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,599
are incorrectly taken down same with

1048
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,839
other political philosophies you think

1049
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,359
facebook is not cracking down on hate

1050
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,640
speech that validates its terms of

1051
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,680
service

1052
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
you make hate speech you report it you

1053
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
don't report it you see how much it gets

1054
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,800
taken down i mean same process applies

1055
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
for

1056
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
for terror for terrorism child

1057
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,839
pornography anything though some of

1058
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,599
these would be

1059
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,480
very hard to do in a non-harmful way and

1060
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
because right now the fundamental

1061
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,680
problem is that you can't solve a

1062
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,240
problem that you don't understand and

1063
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,839
because of this information gap we don't

1064
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,200
really understand what's going on on

1065
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
social media

1066
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
you brought up a really interesting

1067
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,200
point earlier which is i assume we're in

1068
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
an audience of people who are generally

1069
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
pretty hateful towards mark zuckerberg's

1070
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,119
products

1071
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,359
and i know we will eventually get to a

1072
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,520
point in this talk where people will ask

1073
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,599
why do we still use facebook why don't

1074
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,560
we just

1075
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
get rid of it make a decentralized

1076
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
service like mastodon and move

1077
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
everything to there you mentioned that

1078
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
in some regimes there's

1079
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,240
really no alternative to facebook and

1080
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,800
for people to express their opinions

1081
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
openly as an alternative to state

1082
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,119
controlled media

1083
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,920
so but it seems that if we have an

1084
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,200
alternative

1085
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
like mastodon

1086
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
there will still be this problem right

1087
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,480
of like fake accounts and

1088
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,640
and service providers needing to detect

1089
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,079
that activity

1090
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,599
and figure that out so how do you kind

1091
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,720
of square this need for moderation and

1092
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,400
control by the platform versus like our

1093
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,839
you know love of decentralization

1094
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,800
like

1095
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
i don't it's so i want to be clear i am

1096
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
not an expert on master down

1097
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
decentralized social media etc

1098
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,640
my general big impression is

1099
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,480
it's from decentralized systems and for

1100
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,400
instance decentralized financial systems

1101
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,040
is that it is that it's very hard for

1102
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,520
the centralized system to crack down on

1103
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,920
very broadly fraud and bad actors you

1104
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,880
need some

1105
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
and i think crypto is discovering that

1106
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
right now quite frankly

1107
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
i hope that's not too controversial for

1108
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,240
me to say

1109
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
and

1110
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,119
like

1111
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,920
it but but it's definitely true that

1112
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,880
finances are much more interesting to

1113
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,839
bad actors and fraud than say a tiny a

1114
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,000
tiny mastodon server i do think that

1115
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,079
master domingo might have growing pains

1116
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,920
if people are adopted on mass but i

1117
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,839
don't

1118
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:32,640
and

1119
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,359
but but going but go and

1120
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,720
going back you were talking you were

1121
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,800
talking about

1122
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
centralized

1123
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,440
regulation well not regulation just

1124
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,119
moderation really

1125
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,960
i do want to break moderation into

1126
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,040
separate into into

1127
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,720
identity based categories and

1128
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,640
content-based categories though because

1129
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
i think it's important and often gets

1130
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
confused people say fake accounts that's

1131
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
like misinformation right

1132
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
they're actually completely separate

1133
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,880
problems misinformation hate speech etc

1134
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,040
this is a this is a content-based

1135
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
problem it doesn't matter who you are if

1136
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,359
you see if you say

1137
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,359
rabbits are the same species as cats

1138
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,839
this is a lie it's misinformation you

1139
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,280
could be a pet store owner you could be

1140
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,800
a 10 year old kid it's you could be a

1141
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,880
politician do different species

1142
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
i like how you're laughing

1143
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,160
i would never say that exactly it's

1144
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,839
sorry i hope you're not offended i know

1145
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,440
you love bunnies

1146
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
i hope suzuki is doing okay anyways um

1147
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,520
and

1148
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
if you if you say

1149
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
if you set up ten thousand fake accounts

1150
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,880
on social media to say rabbits are

1151
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,040
different species from cats

1152
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,160
there's nothing wrong with this

1153
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,200
statement

1154
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
except for the fact that i'm using fake

1155
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
accounts to say it and then this becomes

1156
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,560
a new trending scene on twitter and then

1157
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,599
drawing other voices of actual people

1158
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,320
and

1159
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,480
and i can yell afterwards okay if

1160
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,720
facebook twitter is taking down my

1161
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,640
correct factual statement that cats and

1162
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,000
rabbits are different but this has

1163
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
nothing to do with accountant it has

1164
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
everything to do with the fact that i'm

1165
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,720
pretending to be a giant crowd when i'm

1166
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,880
a single person

1167
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,760
and

1168
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,480
and

1169
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,760
and and and so i mean

1170
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,079
content moderation is it's deeply

1171
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,079
controversial because i mean

1172
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,240
because people just disagree i'm very

1173
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,000
draw the line how much control to give

1174
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,240
people over what we can talk about and i

1175
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,359
mean

1176
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,359
and and i think that reasonably people

1177
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,960
can have different conclusions over

1178
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,920
virtual draw that's nine but there's

1179
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,480
i have personally seen very few people

1180
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,880
disagreeing with the idea that this idea

1181
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,200
that that that fake accounts taking over

1182
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
the ecosystem should be taken down and

1183
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,720
that that governments should be allowed

1184
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,160
to create tens of thousands of fake

1185
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
accounts to destroy voices and pretend

1186
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,520
to be real people

1187
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,240
and

1188
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
it because they strands out the voices

1189
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
of the regular people just like allowing

1190
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,079
ballot boxes to be stuffed with fake

1191
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,960
votes and it i mean it's important to

1192
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
stop that to protect the sanctity of the

1193
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
ballot it isn't

1194
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,599
it isn't stopping the right to vote to

1195
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,119
remove the fake ballots it's actually

1196
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,079
necessary to to do it

1197
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,839
and i hope this is making sense as an

1198
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,280
analogy

1199
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
and so

1200
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
and and so

1201
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,880
with regard to count in moderation

1202
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
because i think you were heading in that

1203
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,000
direction

1204
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,319
i i mean which

1205
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,839
there has been a lot of debate over

1206
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,880
censorship versus protecting people

1207
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,240
lately

1208
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,560
my personal belief i didn't want to

1209
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
really make this personal belief i did

1210
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,560
not personally work on distribution

1211
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,960
content moderation etc but my personal

1212
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,319
belief is that this is sort of a

1213
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,720
distraction from the actual issue which

1214
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,040
isn't that bad content is being posted

1215
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
is that bad content it's been it's that

1216
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
misinformation conspiracy theories have

1217
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,640
been distributed when they would not

1218
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,240
have been previously

1219
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,599
i mean they were always conspiracy

1220
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,319
theories like 60 years ago

1221
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,520
here in the united states there was a

1222
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,440
conspiracy theory that fluoride was the

1223
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
commonest conspiracy to sappy bodily

1224
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
fluids

1225
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
but no i mean no one would give them the

1226
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
time of the day i mean i think it showed

1227
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,560
up in the drum bridge society a bit but

1228
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,079
i mean it did not show up on cnn they

1229
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,040
did not what's in a new round then sorry

1230
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
well that's why i didn't show up on cnn

1231
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,400
he didn't show up in the new york times

1232
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
he didn't show up in the washington post

1233
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,160
and if it did it would only be to

1234
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
ridicule it really

1235
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,960
and

1236
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
because essentially

1237
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,680
back 60 years ago so

1238
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,839
large media organizations served as

1239
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,680
gatekeepers

1240
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,640
if if if your message wasn't deemed fit

1241
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,599
for publication in the mit it would be

1242
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,400
much harder to get an audience

1243
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,319
and social media has disrupted all of

1244
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,680
that and

1245
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
i was very optimistic about this when it

1246
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,240
started happening like 10 20 years ago

1247
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,000
and it has had a lot of positive impacts

1248
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,160
like for instance i mean it's helped

1249
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,760
it's it's it's up to i mean

1250
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
counter-cultural people find each other

1251
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,560
it's helped the queer community find

1252
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,319
each other but it's also true that i

1253
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,520
mean

1254
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
with the end of with the end of

1255
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
gatekeepers i mean anytime you make

1256
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,720
changes there's going to be consequences

1257
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,200
some of them that aren't positive and i

1258
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
think

1259
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,400
it's over and good to talk about let's

1260
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,319
get rid of the gatekeepers everyone can

1261
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,319
it can do whatever and but but i think

1262
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,280
we're still grappling with the

1263
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,680
consequences of that today

1264
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,440
like i was very optimistic about getting

1265
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,760
rid of gatekeepers when it started but

1266
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,839
back 20 years ago and

1267
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,560
and

1268
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
now now i'm wondering if it would be

1269
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,079
worth it to try and stuff the genie back

1270
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,440
in the bottle quite frankly

1271
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,640
i had a thought i think somewhere around

1272
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,560
2016 or so and especially that

1273
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,880
compounded with the rise of

1274
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,680
technology like gpg3 where it became

1275
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,319
very easy for people to make

1276
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,280
a lot of fake content that looked real

1277
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
without having to actually actually do a

1278
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,599
lot of manual effort

1279
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
that maybe the solution is for people

1280
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,839
just to never trust anything they see

1281
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,000
online except from a very small number

1282
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
of sources for instance i assume the

1283
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,040
reason governments buy fake lot or not

1284
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,440
buy but generate these fake likes and

1285
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,520
posts and

1286
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,040
reshares and so forth is to make

1287
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,480
themselves look more popular to

1288
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,960
their their populace but

1289
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,680
if

1290
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,119
on the other side of that the people

1291
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,720
looking at that just didn't believe it

1292
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
you know if everyone just looked at a

1293
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
post and said all those likes could be

1294
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,839
fake all those comments could be fake

1295
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,839
i'm going to disregard that because it's

1296
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,319
not from a trusted source then perhaps

1297
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,839
we wouldn't have this problem to begin

1298
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,200
with do you think we're headed in that

1299
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,280
direction where

1300
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,800
everything online is just becoming

1301
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,280
fundamentally untrustworthy

1302
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
i think we are headed somewhat in that

1303
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,960
direction and i don't think and i

1304
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,800
wouldn't call it a positive change

1305
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
because society does rely on trust to

1306
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
some degree i mean i can trust that they

1307
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,880
can go on stage and no one mobs me i can

1308
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,400
trust that they go to a starbucks and

1309
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
buy a sandwich and the waitress isn't

1310
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,319
going to poison my food she's not going

1311
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,839
to steal my money

1312
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,599
i can trust that i'm spent using my

1313
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,359
credit card and people always i don't

1314
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,200
have a skimmer set up to steal that to

1315
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
steal it

1316
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,839
and and

1317
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,640
and

1318
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
if you distrust everything then it

1319
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,160
loses a lot of society it loses

1320
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,680
the ability to make friends online to

1321
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,839
talk to one another it loses a lot of

1322
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,240
what made it valuable in the first place

1323
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,880
and and not only that when that managing

1324
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,079
is trusted

1325
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,920
what that really benefits is the people

1326
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
who and trustworthy to begin with

1327
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
a society in which everyone is assumed

1328
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,680
to be a criminal the only people who

1329
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,520
haven't lost anything are the people who

1330
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,640
were already criminals a society a

1331
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,040
society in which no one is trusted the

1332
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,800
the people who benefit the most are the

1333
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,960
people who are the least trustworthy

1334
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,400
because now you're dragging everyone

1335
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,720
down to their level

1336
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,680
like a lot of a lot of why authoritarian

1337
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,280
governments feel the need to do this

1338
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,520
sort of thing in the first place

1339
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,560
is that

1340
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
is that in dictatorships the appearance

1341
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,640
of popularity can be more important than

1342
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
the pop than actual popularity because i

1343
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,880
mean if you're going to be arrested for

1344
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,040
saying you post putin and if you're

1345
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,079
going to be arrested for saying you

1346
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,280
oppose the war

1347
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,319
then you're not going to say that you

1348
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,119
pose a war but how do you overthrow the

1349
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,480
the government if

1350
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,079
everyone else is saying oh yeah i

1351
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,359
support the government regardless of

1352
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,280
what the others actually think it's

1353
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
really hard to go and find other people

1354
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,280
who think similarly who

1355
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,640
to find people who

1356
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,920
to know that you're actually in the

1357
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
majority to know that maybe that

1358
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,599
everyone believes like like you do

1359
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,040
everyone is being like

1360
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,560
i hate the government but i'm going to

1361
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,920
go along with it because everyone else

1362
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,119
does and they're all thinking the same

1363
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,400
thing because they don't know they all

1364
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,079
hate the government

1365
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,880
and i mean

1366
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,480
with the commonest regimes in the

1367
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,200
eastern dock like for instance

1368
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,119
a lot of the region the governments

1369
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,119
thought the native business protesters

1370
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,520
sorry to bust in supporters on mass

1371
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,680
in rallies was that they needed an

1372
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,760
appearance of support if they held a

1373
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,200
rounding and no one showed up that would

1374
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
be a sign of weakness

1375
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,920
but that had its risks like the before

1376
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,680
the father of nikolay chashkin in

1377
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
romania that happened he best he passed

1378
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,839
in the giant crowd of 100 000 people and

1379
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,280
that crowd turned on him in the middle

1380
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,200
of the speech and and that started a

1381
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
revolution then i may turn on him the

1382
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,560
next that's not the next day

1383
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,000
within a few more days he was given a

1384
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,319
show trial and executed

1385
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,560
but that requires people to trust that

1386
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,559
when people are opposing the dictator

1387
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,319
they are actual people and not the

1388
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,960
opposition making the these are by

1389
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,559
people who agree with me like if no one

1390
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,319
trusts anyone like that's also the

1391
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,319
dictator's jobs accomplished no one will

1392
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,880
trust anyone enough to rise up

1393
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,800
and i hope this analogy is making sort

1394
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
of sense

1395
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,359
so i think i want to step back a bit and

1396
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,160
talk about your experience leading up to

1397
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,040
this

1398
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,480
um this act of whistleblowing so

1399
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,400
let's so i know many people here are

1400
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
critical of people who make the decision

1401
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,520
to work at facebook in the first place

1402
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,160
uh what brought you to work work there

1403
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,079
what was your initial motivation well

1404
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,240
the frank reason is that i needed a job

1405
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,960
because i needed money to live and

1406
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,480
eat food and pay rent but

1407
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,359
i mean

1408
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,599
i mean

1409
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,280
i was applying to a number of places

1410
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,880
facebook and a month

1411
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,920
among them this was back in 2017 to 2017

1412
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,680
or so

1413
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,359
it was actually very silly how i got

1414
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,559
recruited

1415
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,839
i

1416
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,559
i

1417
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,640
i had an acquaintance who i met through

1418
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,119
a group of ex-astrophysicists

1419
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,839
in the a area in data science which is

1420
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,440
specific enough that it tells you all

1421
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,640
you need to know about the academic

1422
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,720
diaspora

1423
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,559
and so one of these people worked at

1424
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,960
facebook he randomly recommended me he

1425
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,319
never told me anything i'm assuming he

1426
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,760
got a bonus for

1427
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,440
recommending people and just recommended

1428
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,960
everyone he knew

1429
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,720
and so they tried to recruit they sent

1430
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,559
me a bunch of recruitment letters and

1431
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,720
eventually i mean i got some of my

1432
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,040
downsides from my last job so

1433
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,119
i started every and so i responded to

1434
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,520
one of them i told them hey i told them

1435
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,960
hey that set up an interview and they

1436
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,400
said okay let's do it at this time when

1437
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,839
i got to that time i was ready with my

1438
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,440
phone i waited and they waited and they

1439
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,720
waited and they

1440
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,240
caught me back a few days later and was

1441
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,000
like i'm so sorry let me send you to

1442
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,359
this other person who is really want to

1443
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,200
do this the same thing

1444
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,720
except they did

1445
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
and so and so at that point i gave up on

1446
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,960
them but a few months later they

1447
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,599
messaged me hello we see that we have

1448
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,680
tried to recruit you many times and it

1449
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,079
has not worked out is there anything

1450
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,240
just anything we can do to convince your

1451
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,119
mind otherwise

1452
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,559
i told them that they could get better

1453
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,800
recruiters

1454
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,119
i'm glad you're laughing i

1455
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,280
i'm glad that my deadpan is actually

1456
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,040
effective

1457
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,280
and so anyway and so anyways i mean i'm

1458
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,960
really looking back at it this was a

1459
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,319
dodge ball that we shouldn't have sent

1460
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,319
all the last email

1461
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,160
but anyways um

1462
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,400
anyways the the interviews went well i

1463
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
mean once they actually made the job

1464
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,079
offer i was once they actually made the

1465
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,680
drop off where it was up friends that i

1466
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,040
didn't think facebook was good for

1467
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,400
society

1468
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,559
i told them that's why i was joining if

1469
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,079
there's something that's perfect there's

1470
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,520
nothing to improve anything you change

1471
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,240
would make it worse

1472
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,640
which is still sort of my philosophy to

1473
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,960
a large extent

1474
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,280
i was i was not fond of facebook when i

1475
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,960
joined it and they certainly never

1476
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,520
expected it to get to this level if i

1477
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,359
did i might have run away screaming i

1478
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,599
mean i i mean i'm not a social person

1479
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,280
i'm not an extrovert i i hide i i i hide

1480
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,720
him i would prefer to hide in my room

1481
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,319
with my cats they're good cats

1482
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,839
but

1483
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,680
and but anyway she told me something

1484
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,280
like you'd be surprised how many people

1485
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,599
at facebook say that

1486
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,839
and like

1487
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,119
i mean

1488
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,440
like historically facebook was a fairly

1489
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,760
open company in the sense that people

1490
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,280
were people were allowed to express

1491
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,559
through this content to the entire

1492
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,400
company people could say i think

1493
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,319
facebook should do this better they had

1494
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
regular surveys about how about to their

1495
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
employees of do you think facebook is

1496
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,280
good for society or not

1497
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,200
the number of people responding yes to

1498
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
that was generally in the 50 to 70

1499
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,280
percent range it was around 70 when i

1500
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,839
joined it was 50 when i left my guess is

1501
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,079
that it's about 50 no but i obviously

1502
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,160
don't know i mean there's there's a

1503
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,520
bunch of factories that go into it

1504
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,079
because of self seduction if you if you

1505
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,680
think facebook is the devil you're not

1506
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,440
likely to join facebook if you think

1507
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,800
that facebook is the greatest sense in

1508
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
sliced bread you are more likely to join

1509
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,240
facebook the same thing goes for

1510
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,079
everything else i mean black hat hackers

1511
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,680
tend to be think people who think black

1512
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,480
hat is great or something

1513
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,240
and and so and and so any and so but

1514
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,480
i i mean taking a step back and looking

1515
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
back i do i do still stand by my

1516
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,839
decision

1517
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,440
in the sense that

1518
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,720
i mean it's nice

1519
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
it's nice to say everyone should create

1520
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,119
facebook but people have said that many

1521
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,960
times over the past

1522
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,400
decade

1523
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,520
more than a decade and

1524
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,760
in practice facebook is part of society

1525
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
going forward at least

1526
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,079
at least in the short-term future

1527
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,920
i mean it i mean it's hard to look at

1528
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,760
the long-term facebook hasn't died yet

1529
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
but you could say but i haven't died yet

1530
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,960
myself and i don't think i'm immortal

1531
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,160
and so

1532
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,520
but and

1533
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,680
and ultimately

1534
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,960
like there are some there are some

1535
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,800
positions that i would not join like i

1536
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,880
went in from the start being being sure

1537
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,440
that i wanted to join to go to a place

1538
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,040
where i was focused on improving the

1539
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
company where i thought that i would

1540
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,280
have some sort of net positive impact

1541
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,480
over generic facebook employees 354 who

1542
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,680
would otherwise be in that spot

1543
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,480
and

1544
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,640
but

1545
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,079
i'm not sure i would be comfortable in

1546
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,319
an actual leadership role at a company

1547
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
like facebook because it would be so

1548
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,400
much more political etc but

1549
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
i stand by my decision i had i was able

1550
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,400
to do a lot more that would not have

1551
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,760
been done if i hadn't been there and i

1552
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,960
and and i

1553
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,040
and i would like to and i mean it's too

1554
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,880
it's ultimately up to the historians to

1555
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,720
decide my impact but i would like to say

1556
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,839
that i had a decent impact on the world

1557
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,000
so how long did you work there before

1558
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,839
you started getting the idea that there

1559
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,760
was something you might eventually want

1560
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,119
to blow the whistle on

1561
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,359
it's hard to say because there was never

1562
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,920
any specific moment like if you're

1563
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,359
reading a book you're looking at a movie

1564
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,520
there's some dramatic moment of tension

1565
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,280
in which everyone's like oh this is the

1566
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,680
same moments epiphany that changes my

1567
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,520
life it doesn't work that way in real

1568
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,880
life

1569
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,680
and so like the first time i seriously

1570
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,359
considered but

1571
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,359
considered going out and going with the

1572
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,920
vessel was i mean i think that was

1573
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,319
probably like the late 20 late 2018.

1574
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,559
i mean i it was not i i mean i was

1575
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,160
concerned i was concerned i was

1576
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,640
concerned about uh about activity i was

1577
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,160
fighting in the brazilian in the

1578
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,920
brazilian elections brazil had no

1579
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,880
elections in 2018 that i was that i

1580
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,559
eventually was able to get facebook to

1581
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,559
actually act and take down which

1582
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,680
which is the reason that they're not

1583
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,000
talking about it right now

1584
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,520
and and

1585
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,960
but

1586
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,800
i mean it was in the back of my head it

1587
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,480
was in the back of my head for a long

1588
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,640
time

1589
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,800
at the start i was hopeful that i was

1590
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,640
making a difference and i think i did

1591
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,319
make a difference in some regards in

1592
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,240
terms of concrete difference i had more

1593
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,480
impact on facebook's actions from within

1594
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,680
the company than everything i've done

1595
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,920
since speaking out i mean i might have

1596
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,240
had some indirect impacts but in the

1597
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,920
long term but i

1598
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,760
that's too soon to say at this point

1599
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,240
like at the start i was hopeful because

1600
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,599
i was i was hopeful that okay i had just

1601
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,119
found this now i need to yard people to

1602
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,480
try and get this changed maybe

1603
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,920
eventually they've changed it it's true

1604
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,119
i'm doing this all in my spare time

1605
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,480
right now but they can't keep it up

1606
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,680
forever spoiler alert they did

1607
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,319
and so and like i thought i was building

1608
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,079
political capitals and stuff i was

1609
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,520
talking to a lot of leadership people

1610
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,599
who i should not have been talking to

1611
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,359
like i was briefing the vice president

1612
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,680
on a facebook on of integrity at

1613
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,920
facebook on an issue which like i was

1614
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,359
super low level this is like the

1615
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,359
equivalent of i don't know

1616
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,440
i i don't know usually you don't get

1617
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,960
usually if you're super level you don't

1618
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,240
get caught up to brief the vice

1619
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,359
president when you've been at the job

1620
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,720
for a year

1621
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,119
but i don't know about other companies

1622
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,799
and and it's not a giant company like

1623
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,119
facebook i mean my first job my first

1624
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,280
job was a tiny startup and i reported to

1625
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,119
the ceo somehow marked into on the same

1626
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,319
relationship i don't know why

1627
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,319
so something i don't realize until i've

1628
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,400
read one of the stories about you is

1629
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,240
that you re you

1630
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,960
met with a reporter from the guardian 18

1631
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,280
months before the actual

1632
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,880
leaks came out

1633
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,000
right so

1634
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,079
in that meeting what did you hope to

1635
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,920
accomplish and was there ever the

1636
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,160
possibility of providing this

1637
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,920
information without your identity

1638
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,559
attached to it essentially blowing the

1639
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,599
whistle anonymously yeah absolutely so

1640
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,680
so this meeting was so this meeting was

1641
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,640
in like

1642
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,200
i think november 2019 it was in late

1643
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,400
2019 i don't remember the exact day

1644
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,599
and

1645
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,960
it was in it was in oakland in

1646
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,559
california i live in the bay area i'm

1647
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,640
just visiting here

1648
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,440
yeah yeah i was super paranoid about it

1649
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
i made sure to i made sure to drop off

1650
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,280
all my electronics with a friend

1651
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,280
beforehand who served who agreed to

1652
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
serve as an alibi if anyone asked i was

1653
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,200
putting cats to their place and taking a

1654
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,640
nap which i do plenty

1655
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,920
and

1656
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,160
i put on i put on a cute dress which i

1657
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,799
do not usually wear i mean

1658
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,559
because the idea was because the idea

1659
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,640
was that if anyone noticed hey this

1660
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
person is sneaking around they set up an

1661
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,680
alibi they're dressed up unusually cute

1662
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,359
what is the thought that comes into your

1663
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,240
their your head you're having an affair

1664
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,599
and so that was my that was the

1665
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,599
antibiotic to my antibiotic which did

1666
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,079
not end up

1667
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,760
which

1668
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,920
oh thank you it did not end up being

1669
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,520
necessary i mean

1670
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,960
no one asked what are you what the heck

1671
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,400
are you doing there i i got you

1672
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,480
perfectly fine and the reason i set it

1673
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,799
up in the first place was that

1674
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,440
like i was that basically it occurred to

1675
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,640
me that

1676
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,640
i was basically what you call is it you

1677
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,640
carry the bus problem or something if

1678
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,559
this person gets run over by a bus

1679
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,319
everything is toast and so basically

1680
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,880
i made her i i i i

1681
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,799
basically i told her don't use any of

1682
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,720
this unless i die

1683
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,440
she

1684
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,400
we

1685
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,160
we joked about it a bit i think she said

1686
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,000
i promise i promise i won't assassinate

1687
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,920
you that would be a silly little poem or

1688
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,480
something

1689
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,400
it was something like that i don't

1690
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,559
remember it it's been a while

1691
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,319
and and

1692
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,280
and

1693
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,799
and like

1694
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,559
i i told you it's basically i was

1695
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,480
setting up a contingency time for what

1696
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,400
happened if i suddenly got run over by a

1697
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,280
bus it did not end up being necessary

1698
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,839
and end even and eventually um

1699
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,960
yeah i

1700
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,040
i decided about half a year later that i

1701
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,799
didn't want to that i did want to come

1702
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,079
forward but i thought it was my

1703
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,839
responsibility to

1704
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,599
stay out through 2020 through the

1705
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,119
elections and the reason i didn't know

1706
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,760
how valued they were going to get

1707
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,880
and

1708
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,359
anyways and about keeping my identity

1709
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,520
anonymous i mean in principle that was

1710
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,400
obvious always an option but in practice

1711
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,760
it would never have been anonymous from

1712
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,000
the company and my co-workers because i

1713
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,440
was the only person who worked on this

1714
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,280
and the only person who cared about this

1715
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,200
so it would be super obvious to everyone

1716
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,880
inside the company if anonymous

1717
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,720
whisperer comes

1718
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,319
forward with this and so the question is

1719
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,920
really am i going to be anonymous to the

1720
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,480
public and i mean

1721
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,599
i mean that was an option i had i mean

1722
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,280
i had that option too

1723
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,720
when buzzfeed published over my

1724
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
objections i told them to go ahead with

1725
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,680
my name because i believe in

1726
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,839
accountability and everything

1727
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,760
but i mean that's me there are plenty of

1728
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,359
people who have made different decisions

1729
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,240
i don't begrudge than that

1730
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,000
so i'm really fascinated by the

1731
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,599
mechanics of whistleblowing and the

1732
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,640
steps people take to protect their

1733
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,480
anonymity throughout the process at

1734
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,599
least up to the point where they

1735
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,280
actually leak the documents and i think

1736
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,119
from what i've read your process was one

1737
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,160
of the more

1738
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,079
uh careful ones that i've seen people do

1739
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,160
yeah could you talk a little about like

1740
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,319
how you went around went about finding a

1741
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,319
trustworthy reporter that you want you

1742
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,480
actually wanted to talk to and believed

1743
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,720
what you know take the necessary steps

1744
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,720
to protect you and

1745
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,480
what you did to protect yourself from

1746
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,720
your employer finding out that you were

1747
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,200
doing this

1748
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
so so it was on the very careful side

1749
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,640
but it's hard to say how i compared to

1750
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,880
other people because again

1751
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
once if you're trying to be anonymous

1752
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,319
then if everyone knows about you then

1753
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,520
you failed

1754
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,520
so i'm sure there are people who have

1755
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,359
done great who we don't know about

1756
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,079
because they did great

1757
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,960
so anyways going back i mean

1758
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,480
i mean when i met with junior that was

1759
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,640
half sorting her out for potentially in

1760
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,640
the future i mean i guess i built up a

1761
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,960
relationship with her over the course of

1762
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,480
a year a year and a half or so that made

1763
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,839
me decide to go forward with her

1764
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:02,960
eventually

1765
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,480
like

1766
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,000
like there are a lot of different like

1767
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,839
there are a lot of different approaches

1768
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,000
and steps you can take them

1769
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,720
down in the vessel and it's the end

1770
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,799
and whispering is a vague term it's used

1771
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,480
for everything from

1772
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,240
going waste documents to the government

1773
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,839
to leaking something to the press or et

1774
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,599
cetera

1775
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,319
and anyways

1776
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,040
and anyways i mean it was obvious to me

1777
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,640
from the start that

1778
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,559
i could not come forward

1779
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,160
completely anonymously and that was

1780
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,839
frankly not of too much interest to me

1781
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,960
either

1782
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,720
though i don't know i don't know i'm not

1783
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,400
superior used by the idea of living

1784
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,920
forever but maybe i wouldn't say that if

1785
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,160
i were immortal

1786
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,040
and like

1787
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,599
like facebook was like facebook was

1788
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,280
going to find out eventually the

1789
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,200
question was how how do i prevent them

1790
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,880
from finding out until i'm actually at

1791
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,799
until my pace and so

1792
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,400
i mean in my case

1793
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,599
i mean different people have different

1794
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,280
approaches to whistleblowing and leaking

1795
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,920
and etc like i chose to focus on coming

1796
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
forward with materials that i was a

1797
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,000
personal expert on that my work was

1798
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,319
integral to that i could be absolutely

1799
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,400
certain that i had interpreted correctly

1800
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,920
that i wasn't taking them out of context

1801
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,280
to etc

1802
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,280
that i could be through that while they

1803
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,040
could answer any questions about them

1804
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,079
different people have different

1805
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
approaches like i don't begrudge francis

1806
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,000
her choice i don't regret chelsea her

1807
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,559
choice for for that matter

1808
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,599
and so

1809
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,760
because of that because because of that

1810
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,440
it was probably that's

1811
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,960
that's suspicious i mean i was very

1812
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,480
worried about facebook security people

1813
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,520
when i started this like for instance

1814
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,119
like for instance when i talk

1815
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,799
when i document these things first i

1816
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,480
would make up an excuse to you to cover

1817
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,000
up the webcam i would go into the

1818
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,839
bathroom with my laptop and cover up the

1819
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,280
webcam

1820
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,720
then

1821
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,720
so i had an excuse as to why i would do

1822
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,040
it then i would take pictures then keep

1823
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,400
it covered

1824
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,319
take pictures of the of the laptop with

1825
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,319
my it's my personal phone so that i mean

1826
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,160
because if you take screenshots and send

1827
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,000
them the email obviously

1828
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,079
that's not good and

1829
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,559
yeah and i used under used vpns and

1830
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,240
didn't do anything on work networks and

1831
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,160
et cetera

1832
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,079
and they and they and they only and i

1833
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,039
was very careful i only opened like even

1834
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,319
even though all these were documents

1835
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,760
that i worked on and conversations that

1836
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
i was having i only worked on them when

1837
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,400
i had an excuse and the excuse was that

1838
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,079
i was looking was that i was looking

1839
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,319
through them for for uh performance

1840
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,920
review seasoning which i needed to tidy

1841
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,599
up what i did and everything so that was

1842
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,799
a community excuse to look through

1843
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,079
everything but

1844
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:30,960
i mean

1845
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,680
it frankly i mean if what francis did

1846
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,160
was she went she got a lot of documents

1847
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,680
francis hogan a different whistleblower

1848
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,039
who you probably have heard of who is a

1849
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,200
lot more famous than me

1850
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
and so what francis did is that she she

1851
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,280
she looked up a lot a lot of

1852
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,039
documents that were that were public

1853
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,640
face in within the company that she

1854
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,400
didn't work on and that was much more

1855
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,240
sketchy than what i was doing and it was

1856
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
frankly very surprised that facebook

1857
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,400
didn't catch her because i i was

1858
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,039
terrified the whole time

1859
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,280
but anyways

1860
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,480
like i

1861
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,079
i don't know i i was very careful i but

1862
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,440
it's impossible to say how much is

1863
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,760
paranoia and how much it's justified

1864
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,760
because which i'm sure it's a experience

1865
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,520
very familiar to two people in this room

1866
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,760
who work on that sort of thing

1867
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,799
you only know that you haven't been

1868
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:20,240
paranoid enough when it's too late

1869
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,000
so as far as i can tell facebook's

1870
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,960
official response to all of these things

1871
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,720
that you've come out with is we don't

1872
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,599
know about that that's uh

1873
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,799
and it's just sort of this denial and

1874
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,720
are you worried at all about legal

1875
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,440
action from them against you yeah so so

1876
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,280
let's break this down first but how do

1877
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,640
they respond secondly legal action so

1878
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,359
so facebook has had two general types of

1879
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,640
response to me

1880
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,599
the first is that it's a very i don't

1881
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,839
know what it called standard cooperates

1882
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,359
they gave they gave something that looks

1883
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,520
like a denial that is not actually a

1884
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,760
denial that is close enough that they

1885
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,680
look like this green but does not

1886
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,319
actually engage on the substance i'm

1887
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,960
going to use an analogy so my girlfriend

1888
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,520
lisa is in the audience and suppose that

1889
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
suppose that tomorrow she asks me

1890
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,839
well when we're back home in california

1891
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,920
she asked me hey sophie did you watch

1892
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,760
the districts and they look at her and

1893
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,720
say

1894
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,520
i always prioritize washing the dishes i

1895
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,440
have washed the dishes

1896
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,760
50 times in the past year i have

1897
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,079
invested over a hundred dollars in

1898
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,920
cleaning supplies over the course of my

1899
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,160
life washing the dishes is a deeply

1900
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,000
difficult problem and it will never be

1901
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,480
fully solved

1902
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,079
and i do want to be clear i did not make

1903
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,920
up this analogy i bought i stole it from

1904
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,920
izzy lepovsky who i think is a reporter

1905
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,599
for wired she gave me permission like a

1906
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,079
year ago

1907
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:53,920
and

1908
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,839
and and so that's the first type of

1909
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,720
facebook denial in which they look like

1910
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,400
they disagree but they're not actually

1911
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,319
engaging on the substance because they

1912
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,920
refuse to engage on the substance

1913
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,039
because they don't want to actually

1914
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,200
answer the actual question like if i

1915
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
said that to my girlfriend which she

1916
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,119
would be very justified in being upset

1917
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,640
at me but somehow when this company

1918
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,000
doing it everyone's like oh yeah that's

1919
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,720
a totally fine answer

1920
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
the second response is they've only

1921
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,960
given this in one case which is in which

1922
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,640
is india a very non-star restored trdr

1923
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,039
in india in india i called it i caught a

1924
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,480
lot of people across the political

1925
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,240
spectrum facebook agreed to take down

1926
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,240
all of them up until we discovered that

1927
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,920
whenever that one of these networks was

1928
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,640
being run with little obfuscation

1929
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,640
out of the account of the sitting indian

1930
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,200
chairperson of parliamentary chairperson

1931
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,920
of ethics quite ironically

1932
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,400
and so as soon as that was discovered i

1933
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,160
got got the stonewall couldn't get an

1934
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,760
answer from anyone even though they had

1935
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,079
already agreed to take it down

1936
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,880
and and so anyways on that specific case

1937
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,400
they've done something very different

1938
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,640
which is they changed

1939
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,319
they seem to have changed their response

1940
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,839
so quickly that they hope no one can

1941
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,599
keep up with it

1942
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,359
they gave the guardians three different

1943
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,480
responses that you can see in the

1944
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,000
guardians original article they said

1945
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,240
first this is a lie didn't happen then

1946
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,680
we showed them the actual documents they

1947
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,920
were like okay okay that happened but we

1948
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,760
took it but we took it down

1949
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,280
no you didn't

1950
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,960
yes we took it down with a different

1951
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,799
team that did not interact with sophie

1952
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,240
and did not tell her anything and was

1953
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,880
not recorded in the documentation which

1954
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,119
okay sure maybe you did it we took it

1955
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,520
down in and according to them they took

1956
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,760
it down this way six months later and

1957
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,000
i'm like well i can't deny they they say

1958
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,119
that they took it down without telling

1959
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,359
me without letting me myself know i mean

1960
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,880
why am i to deny that and so and so and

1961
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,200
so i was like okay i'll be charitable

1962
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,799
when i talk to people i'll say according

1963
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,000
to because they took it down but they

1964
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
still waited half a year except that

1965
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,119
when i told them to them they were like

1966
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,640
no we didn't we didn't take any time i'm

1967
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,359
like that's exactly what he said but and

1968
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,280
and the headlines like

1969
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,520
sophie john and facebook disagree on

1970
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,839
what happened for etc because

1971
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,920
and

1972
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,359
and anyways i got so i got so fed up

1973
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,760
with this and and going back and forth

1974
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,359
on testifying to the indian government

1975
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,240
that

1976
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,079
i eventually released the actual

1977
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,720
documents in question

1978
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,880
about about uh i don't i don't remember

1979
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,720
like 60 pages it it was i released them

1980
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,039
with this i tried i tried to get 30

1981
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,039
indian news on the same one boy 22 a

1982
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,839
grade 15 if the 15 actually published

1983
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:28,880
but

1984
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,599
it was it it was major news in india for

1985
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,200
one day before they forgot about it and

1986
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,359
went to the next news in and anyways

1987
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,359
facebook's official response to my

1988
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,960
publicly releasing the documents to the

1989
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,799
entire world could see them was we

1990
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,559
cannot comment on this because we have

1991
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,680
not yet seen the documents

1992
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,160
and so that's where we are right now and

1993
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,240
so that's the second type of response

1994
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,960
from facebook and they see

1995
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,359
it's both sad that it's most funny how

1996
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,720
often they've changed their story and

1997
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,400
said that no one's held them to account

1998
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,440
on it

1999
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,599
and so anyways that's that's facebook's

2000
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,799
responses and in terms of lawsuits

2001
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,400
facebook could see me for any for every

2002
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,640
penny if they wanted to i'm protected by

2003
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,319
that more by the stress and effect than

2004
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,920
anything

2005
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,079
frankly though before i came forward i

2006
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,319
was much more the

2007
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,238
i was much more worried about

2008
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,679
about about

2009
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,679
governmental action both from the fact

2010
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,679
that that i've made enemies with two

2011
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,120
world governments that have a track

2012
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,479
record of their political enemies

2013
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,319
meeting with and with

2014
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,960
suspicious accidents

2015
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,719
and from the fact that what i did could

2016
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,679
other could allegedly be violating the

2017
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,120
us federal law

2018
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,719
well i know you wouldn't want to say

2019
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,640
this but i had conversations with my

2020
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,759
girlfriend

2021
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,359
before coming forward about what would

2022
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,960
happen if she would compel to testify

2023
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,880
against me for instance

2024
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,399
because i mean it could be a dutch that

2025
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,040
i volunteered the trade secret act which

2026
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,600
uh i think it was anthony lewandowski

2027
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,719
the uber

2028
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,238
the google way more person who was

2029
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,920
convicted on because it could be a dutch

2030
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,120
that they took straight secrets from

2031
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,640
facebook and

2032
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,120
and and they could also and and and it

2033
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,799
could have also been alleged that they

2034
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,439
validated the cfa before the vampire and

2035
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,198
versus us case

2036
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,040
and so that was something my daughter

2037
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,158
was very concerned about i was like

2038
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:16,000
if it comes to that i'll be i'll be i'll

2039
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,080
do civil disobedience so i'm fine with

2040
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,920
that but i mean thankfully facebook is

2041
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,880
not that popular on capitol hill and so

2042
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,520
and so and so i'm not and so and so i'm

2043
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,279
not being arrested but i mean that was

2044
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,520
something we discussed in dubs and it's

2045
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,359
an example of why if you want to be a

2046
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,719
whistleblower you should talk to a

2047
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,719
lawyer

2048
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,640
so i want to leave a lot of time for

2049
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,359
questions so just a few more here about

2050
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,759
the consequences that have happened

2051
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,839
since you did the leaks what has the

2052
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,920
impact been on your personal life what

2053
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,600
do you do now and what what are you

2054
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,439
planning to do in the future

2055
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,679
right now i stay home and pet my cats

2056
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,040
they get cats

2057
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,280
i also go i also go to conferences and

2058
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,280
do interviews and talk to people i mean

2059
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,520
i i don't like doing that i would much

2060
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,280
rather stay home and put my cats i'm

2061
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,199
totally not a crazy cat lady i swear

2062
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
and but any but

2063
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,560
i mean i don't like doing it but someone

2064
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,239
has to do it i mean no one likes waking

2065
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,080
up at 7am to go into the office but you

2066
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,000
still do it so i mean this

2067
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,800
same

2068
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,560
same way in my book

2069
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,360
like

2070
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,280
i didn't i didn't intend to be doing

2071
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,440
this for so long actually i thought

2072
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,360
people would stop caring about me after

2073
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,880
half a year but i mean apparently i'm

2074
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,560
still doing this and it just seems a bit

2075
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,880
unfair to be joining another company and

2076
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,480
being like oh yeah i have to leave next

2077
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,239
to next week for hope conference and

2078
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,520
then we need a few events to speak at

2079
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,360
this conference in india and i it's such

2080
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,159
i mean that just seems unfair you know

2081
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,480
conflicts of interest and all that

2082
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,520
and so i stay home and pet my cats i

2083
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,280
i i don't i don't take payments from

2084
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,280
from people i think i asked i think i

2085
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,360
told them to either way to either wave

2086
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,199
the paper the the honorarium for this

2087
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,960
what an idea to the eff which seemed

2088
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,719
appropriate um

2089
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,890
like that's usually like oh

2090
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:03,280
[Applause]

2091
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,199
oh thank you

2092
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:05,920
i

2093
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,360
just i mean this is something i didn't

2094
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,719
want to be clear this is something i can

2095
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,960
personally afford to do because a i have

2096
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,400
a lot of savings because i worked at

2097
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,560
facebook even if even if i'm told that i

2098
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,719
was underpaid and b i have it i have an

2099
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,560
amazing girlfriend who is happy for me

2100
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,159
to be her housewife although we aren't

2101
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,559
married

2102
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,720
and

2103
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,800
[Applause]

2104
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,640
the reason i did this it's just that i

2105
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,800
mean she's out she's out for the money

2106
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,679
it's the typical it's one of the typical

2107
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,520
criticisms of whistleblowers and they

2108
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,280
wanted to very strongly avoid that and

2109
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,040
be able to honestly say i have not taken

2110
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,120
any penny from anyone to gain from my

2111
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,040
wisdom blowing but i do want to be clear

2112
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,199
you should not necessarily expect this

2113
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,640
from other people because that is going

2114
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,480
to limit whistleblowers to people who

2115
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,959
are rich and self-sufficient

2116
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:58,080
[Applause]

2117
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,800
well i'm just so popular today

2118
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,840
i wasn't expecting that so yeah

2119
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,520
so yeah that's that's what i do with my

2120
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,480
life

2121
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,400
right now

2122
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,199
i frankly am with my cats right now

2123
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,800
they're very good

2124
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,320
i'll be taking the train home after this

2125
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
conference and i'll p and and i'll pet

2126
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,440
them a lot after this

2127
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,600
so i i just want to emphasize that what

2128
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,920
you did was really a tremendous act of

2129
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,239
bravery and of selflessness because not

2130
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,760
only are you not taking money to to

2131
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,120
you know do any conferences or

2132
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,040
interviews you actually turn down

2133
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,000
a 64 000 severance package from facebook

2134
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,679
in order to avoid signing a

2135
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,760
non-disparagement agreement

2136
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,640
um

2137
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,640
so i also wanted to ask if you did this

2138
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,040
again would you do anything differently

2139
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,600
and do you have any particular advice

2140
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,800
for future whistleblowers out here

2141
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,320
if i did this again

2142
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,880
there were two things i would have pro

2143
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,560
that i think i would have done

2144
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,880
differently that i think for certain i

2145
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,080
mean i mean

2146
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,679
i mean if i actually found myself in

2147
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,360
back in time first i would freak out

2148
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,920
then i would go to i don't know i would

2149
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,360
try to figure out if i wanted to go with

2150
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,719
to the government with all my future

2151
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,040
knowledge but i mean

2152
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,600
taking the question at its premise

2153
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,280
i mean

2154
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,239
there are two things i would do

2155
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,239
differently first i would probably have

2156
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:21,520
not published the memo that god's leaked

2157
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,960
because i mean

2158
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
as anyone who's done since an all night

2159
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,880
you can know if you write eight thousand

2160
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,120
words in eight hours in the all nighter

2161
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,199
not all of it will be perfect you will

2162
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,480
make mistakes

2163
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,159
and if someone else

2164
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,640
say a reporter decides to spend their

2165
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,480
holiday time during their own all

2166
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,719
nighter to write an article about it

2167
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,520
the result may not may have some flaws

2168
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,560
and so

2169
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,840
and and and so

2170
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,360
there were a number of cases in which

2171
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,120
this led let's lead to a lot of

2172
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,199
misleading reports and misinformation

2173
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,199
for instance let's give an example i use

2174
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,840
the word actors to refer to people

2175
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,080
acting to do something not in the

2176
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,760
hollywood sense

2177
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,960
this quote

2178
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,360
this quote was reported without context

2179
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,679
and there is still an article online if

2180
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,080
you google that's in the indian press

2181
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,600
that says i caught bollywood red-handed

2182
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
because because i mean like i did not

2183
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,600
know that this was going to i did not

2184
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,040
know that this was going to be leaked i

2185
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,400
did not know that this is google really

2186
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,800
published go viral whatever and so

2187
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,320
anyway and so

2188
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,560
but it did and so i i had written this

2189
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,920
assuming that people

2190
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,679
who read it would know what i meant and

2191
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:32,960
it turned out i was writing for a

2192
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,120
completely different different crowd

2193
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,040
and so and

2194
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,360
yeah

2195
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,800
and and so and so and so i i

2196
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,640
i did my best to i did my best to

2197
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,480
correct the record it was not very good

2198
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,239
because i mean that's that's the way

2199
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,840
fact-checking works

2200
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,040
you some

2201
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,400
someone posts something gets ten

2202
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,080
thousand likes the fact check gets a

2203
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,440
hundred

2204
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,920
and so and so anyways the other thing i

2205
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,600
would have done differently is that they

2206
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,840
would have gotten

2207
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,159
a pr agent or other support before

2208
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,920
coming forward because right now i'm

2209
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,080
doing everything myself like

2210
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,920
people send me messages i book sentences

2211
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,960
i try to interviews etc and

2212
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,199
i mean it's worked i mean it's it's it's

2213
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,360
worked out but but frankly i have not

2214
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,880
been very good at it considering that

2215
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,239
i'm an introvert who prefers to stay

2216
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,880
home and pet my cats and considering the

2217
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,360
fact that as anyone who's done something

2218
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,400
can tell you

2219
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,159
you're knowing something is not actually

2220
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,600
an effective strategy for doing

2221
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,880
something important that you've never

2222
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,800
done before

2223
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,600
and

2224
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,360
i mean i think they offer i think i do

2225
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,920
offer some i mean by now by now this has

2226
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,600
sort of be my brand

2227
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,520
i i don't i don't i don't have a pr

2228
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,400
agent i don't i don't i don't i try to

2229
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,719
keep things temporary and yes i talk to

2230
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,520
everyone who asks etc

2231
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,880
because i think it offers something

2232
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
valuable at this point for me to be in

2233
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,480
this niche because i mean there are some

2234
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,400
people who look at francis hogg and say

2235
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,320
she's too prepared she has some she

2236
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
everything she says is scripted you

2237
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,000
can't she can't trust her and then they

2238
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,600
look at me and says she's stuttering she

2239
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,120
has a bad accent she doesn't have anyone

2240
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,960
supporting her nothing she says scripted

2241
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,520
you can't trust her and i

2242
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,360
and i think it is useful to have that

2243
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,600
contrast right now but if i were doing

2244
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,440
and so that's why i keep doing this and

2245
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,040
also because this is essentially my

2246
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,640
brand and i'm fine with it and i'm fine

2247
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,840
keeping it but it has also frankly

2248
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,360
held me back in a number of ways and

2249
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,280
they were doing some this again i would

2250
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,280
probably have bet the bulletin got a pr

2251
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,280
agent i did try but i was not very

2252
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,840
successful

2253
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,960
right thank you sophie that was a

2254
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,800
fantastic interview let's give her

2255
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,800
another

2256
01:16:51,410 --> 01:17:03,199
[Applause]

2257
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,360
we do have time for some questions and

2258
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,880
uh people in the audience who would like

2259
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,560
to ask a question there's a microphone

2260
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,040
back there and we'll do questions not

2261
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,040
discussion or dialogue so please try to

2262
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,199
be concise uh we do have a question that

2263
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,520
came in from the matrix chat and others

2264
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,120
are of course welcome to send in uh

2265
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,199
questions if you're in the room on site

2266
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,440
or remote uh to the matrix chat i'm

2267
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,199
monitoring that here so a question that

2268
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,440
came in a little bit earlier in the talk

2269
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,920
was i think related to fact checking it

2270
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,400
was essentially

2271
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,000
that facebook is such a rich company

2272
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,760
such a large company

2273
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,440
do they really have an excuse or what's

2274
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,280
the problem with resourcing adequately

2275
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,199
to address the types of concerns that

2276
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,520
were identified

2277
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,520
so so this goes back to what i said

2278
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,239
before facebook is a company the goal is

2279
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,719
to make money not to save the world

2280
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,520
i mean

2281
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,679
does philippe morris the tobacco company

2282
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,280
have the resources to make the

2283
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,040
cigarettes that's addictive they

2284
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
probably do they probably have the

2285
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,199
resources to give them to give medicare

2286
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,880
a small reimbursement every time someone

2287
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,480
gets sick with lung cancer and needs to

2288
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,239
be treated by medicare but they're not

2289
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,400
going to do that because because of your

2290
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,080
company

2291
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
the goal is to make money and if you

2292
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,920
think that they're bad for that reason

2293
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,600
that's not really a criticism of them

2294
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,440
it's a criticism of capitalism which a

2295
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,760
lot of people have said and but

2296
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,120
have there have not been any great

2297
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,360
replacements for it that's far

2298
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,840
and so and so really and so i think it's

2299
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,920
important to really remember that

2300
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,320
because i mean facebook was facebook

2301
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,760
will say a lot of nice great things

2302
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,520
about how we're your friends and we're

2303
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,080
here to make you to connect the world

2304
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,520
and they might even believe some of it

2305
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,679
but at and then at the end of the day

2306
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,440
they're there to make money and so

2307
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,679
do they have the resources certainly are

2308
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,120
they going to use them

2309
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,760
why would they

2310
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,400
thank you there's a question in the room

2311
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,920
in your in your defense i think a lot of

2312
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,920
us in this room believe that ronald

2313
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,280
reagan was a bad actor

2314
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,880
but

2315
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,440
i'm actually confused why you didn't

2316
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,159
manage to organize a number of or at

2317
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,480
least people didn't clump around you who

2318
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,960
were ethical data scientists within

2319
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,040
facebook and you ended up the only

2320
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,520
person in facebook who was really

2321
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,520
concerned about this and you were

2322
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,960
expressing it in public within the

2323
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,800
company i would think people would align

2324
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,280
with you and also give you some cover

2325
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,600
and plausible deniability

2326
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,440
or is that just the fate of an introvert

2327
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,239
who tries to do this kind of thing

2328
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,239
i think part of it is that as you say

2329
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,080
i'm an introvert and terrible at

2330
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,000
organizing people i am not the right

2331
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,480
person for this

2332
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,760
i mean i'm sure there are people who

2333
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,440
would love i mean

2334
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,880
i made my first friend when i was like

2335
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,560
17. like

2336
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,640
when i was younger like

2337
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,239
when clerks would go talk to you in the

2338
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,760
store do you need any help i would run

2339
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,520
away from them i didn't i hope i didn't

2340
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,719
traumatize any of them for life

2341
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,239
so yeah like

2342
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,480
i don't know

2343
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,159
i i i like there were people who

2344
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:05,040
supported me in principle but in terms

2345
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,719
of the actual work i was doing it

2346
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,800
largely by myself because i mean people

2347
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,560
are busy there are people at work and no

2348
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,560
one likes to be given extra work and

2349
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,760
work and maybe and and

2350
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,960
and

2351
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,239
and i was never in a position of

2352
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,719
authority to tell them to do work and

2353
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:21,840
i mean

2354
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,760
everyone is at different places in their

2355
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,520
life like maybe they have a family they

2356
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,880
have to support and they can't afford to

2357
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,000
lose their job and so they're not going

2358
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,920
to spend something that's

2359
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,000
that that will cause the performance to

2360
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,480
go down in reviews because it doesn't do

2361
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,800
the work that they require to do

2362
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,199
like a lot of i knew the people who were

2363
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,040
upset with facebook but were there on

2364
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,440
h1b visas and so the

2365
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,360
residency was held hostage to their

2366
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,800
employment

2367
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,760
and so

2368
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,239
and so i mean it's easy from the outside

2369
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,320
it's easy from the outside to judge but

2370
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,639
i mean no one is obligated towards their

2371
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:55,760
life

2372
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,239
with in temporary insanity when if an

2373
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,239
ideal

2374
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,960
like like

2375
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,120
trying like the whole facebook saga was

2376
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,520
pretty disruptive i mean i lost i lost a

2377
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,719
lot of friends when i joined it i think

2378
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,080
they thought i was assad but i'm not

2379
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,280
sure because i didn't come back

2380
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,800
afterwards

2381
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,960
i mean i lost and and of course a lot of

2382
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,040
my work as a not a number of my work

2383
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,880
people ghosted me after i came forward

2384
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,880
as a whistleblower not too surprisingly

2385
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,080
and so

2386
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,120
and

2387
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,360
but i mean and but there's also been a

2388
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,280
pandemic and everything i mean you have

2389
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,719
lots of data points you can't say it's

2390
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,560
because of this this lesson as you know

2391
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,159
unless you've done a careful experiment

2392
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,840
which you can't do for this sort of

2393
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,320
thing and so i guess for them really

2394
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
trying to say it's

2395
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,199
a

2396
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,400
it might have been that it could have

2397
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,239
organized people but i was frankly very

2398
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:45,280
bad at it i'm terrible at it and so i i

2399
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,960
failed and secondly there were people

2400
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,040
who could but not enough to like

2401
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,760
actively devote time that because this

2402
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,760
was not clearly in the areas the way

2403
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,639
that it was sort of in mine and because

2404
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,320
it would take a lot of time to look into

2405
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,920
this and they would have taken a lot of

2406
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,120
time for them to

2407
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,719
essentially do the on-the-job learning

2408
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,239
that i was and i hope that's making

2409
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,559
sense

2410
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,560
another question that came in through

2411
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,000
matrix i think it relates to what you

2412
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,600
just talked about actually you talked

2413
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,679
now about some of the emotional toll and

2414
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:14,960
uh

2415
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,199
and some of the uh collegiality or lack

2416
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,639
of it in the workplace we had a question

2417
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,880
that came in about the professional toll

2418
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,639
that this took and and if you could talk

2419
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,719
about that and what some of the costs

2420
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,360
were professionally and also i think an

2421
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,320
interesting sideline to that question is

2422
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,199
if there might have been any

2423
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,400
professional benefits that you've

2424
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,120
identified already

2425
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,400
yeah

2426
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,040
it's hard for me to assess professional

2427
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,679
toe and benefits because a i have very

2428
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,920
few data points this was my second job

2429
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,800
out of graduate school and b and b i

2430
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,480
haven't been trying to follow up

2431
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,360
opportunities very currently

2432
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,880
and

2433
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,800
you can tell that i'm a data scientist

2434
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,760
anyway

2435
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,800
and and

2436
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,040
like

2437
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,679
so let's talk about professional impact

2438
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,360
both within the company while i was

2439
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,679
doing this and also after leaving since

2440
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,679
becoming a whistleblower

2441
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:08,400
so

2442
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,800
within the company like

2443
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,480
facebook has but has

2444
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,159
performance reviews

2445
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,639
every every half year and they go they

2446
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,520
go from mid snow expectations which is

2447
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,800
you're fired we don't know why we

2448
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,719
haven't done that already to to

2449
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,639
redefines expectations which is we need

2450
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,320
10 000 of you

2451
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,520
and so

2452
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,840
my reviews were all over the place

2453
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,239
my first first half i was meet some

2454
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,719
expectations which is basically

2455
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,560
shape up where you're fired second half

2456
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,480
i got greatly exceeds expectations which

2457
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,679
is oh my god so certified

2458
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,280
then i got then i got exceeds

2459
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,719
expectations which is you're doing great

2460
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,639
and then i got meets most expectations

2461
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,239
which is shape up for your fight and i

2462
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,000
was fired

2463
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,880
and so this sort of noisiness is not

2464
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,320
typical

2465
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,199
it's

2466
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:56,880
what's actually most common i'm told is

2467
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,560
that you get meets all expectations

2468
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,679
since the

2469
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,800
level uh

2470
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,719
for most of your time there

2471
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:05,600
but

2472
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,400
the

2473
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,560
i i also had three managers during my

2474
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,159
time at facebook which i think

2475
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,320
contributed to that in some regards

2476
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,159
different ones interpreted my work

2477
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,600
differently

2478
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,719
and

2479
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,159
i mean some of them like some of them

2480
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,360
liked what i was doing some of them

2481
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,080
didn't it's i don't think i don't think

2482
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,320
you'll be a spoiler to say that

2483
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,320
my last manager was not fond of me

2484
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,960
spending time doing this

2485
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,520
and and so and so it was all over the

2486
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,000
place with regards to my

2487
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,440
work at facebook

2488
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,360
at facebook it i think i think they

2489
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,120
appreciated at first when they were

2490
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,719
getting a lot of free work because i was

2491
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:42,320
essentially doing two jobs at the same

2492
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,880
time but they eventually got in but got

2493
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,199
annoyed that it was doing it

2494
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:50,080
with regards to my actual personal

2495
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,840
professional career outside of facebook

2496
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,480
and everything

2497
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,679
like i have gotten lots of people saying

2498
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,679
we would like to hire you i mean timed

2499
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,000
with media attention and all that

2500
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,679
it's hard to say how many i mean i i

2501
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,280
haven't i haven't strongly tried to

2502
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,199
follow up on any of them it was one

2503
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,560
exception

2504
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,760
i i haven't tried i haven't tried to

2505
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,440
look deeper in them because

2506
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,760
because i'm busy and there is some what

2507
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,560
you call it um sampling bias if someone

2508
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,320
thinks that i'm that i'm terrible they

2509
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,080
are not going to send me great great

2510
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,920
messages about we would like to hire you

2511
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,520
but and they're also probably polite

2512
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,920
enough to not say your return called we

2513
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,639
will never hire so i don't know so so i

2514
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,080
only hear from the people who have

2515
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,440
strong opinions which are mostly the

2516
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,120
people who like me and so i don't

2517
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,080
actually

2518
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,000
so it's hard to say because i haven't

2519
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,719
actually applied for jobs but i did get

2520
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,560
a number but i did get a number of

2521
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,880
people who saw my experience as positive

2522
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,120
and offered to hire me i mean i have

2523
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,360
heard anecdotally that other prominent

2524
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,760
whistleblowers have had similar

2525
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,560
experiences and so

2526
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,400
i would definitely not recommend mr

2527
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,120
doing as a purely selfish move to boost

2528
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,600
your career and do things but i mean i

2529
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,360
mean some people some people some people

2530
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,639
have gone that route which is

2531
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,639
unfortunately i think white recently

2532
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:07,679
covered whistleblowers whistleblowers

2533
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,280
these days

2534
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,760
like like like i think last year there

2535
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,719
was

2536
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,960
i think last year there was um a case in

2537
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,600
the which uh fox news anchor walked off

2538
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,040
on air saying that she had given a ton

2539
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,440
of stuff to project veritas and everyone

2540
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,520
was very excited up until her evidence

2541
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,280
was spawned that's unconvincing by which

2542
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,960
point she had already pocketed a lot of

2543
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
donations

2544
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,880
but

2545
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,120
like

2546
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,040
like in terms of the in terms of the per

2547
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,120
i can imagine someone who who wants to

2548
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,880
be famous finding this positive but for

2549
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,320
me this

2550
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,239
but for me the person also has to be

2551
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,000
negative when i do it because it's

2552
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,280
important

2553
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,120
but i mean it's it's less negative than

2554
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,840
working at facebook was though so

2555
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,000
so like i don't know rebound like

2556
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
because i was frank like i mean like i

2557
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,280
was serious when i wrote that i had

2558
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,960
blood on my hands like i started losing

2559
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,520
sleep at night beca because because i

2560
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,639
was

2561
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,159
because because i mean i was staying up

2562
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,560
and worrying like i stopped being able

2563
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,040
to fall asleep reliably without this as

2564
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,040
the my girlfriend sleep in the same bed

2565
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,719
with me while we went to dayton at the

2566
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,480
time like many people i started dating

2567
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,760
my housemate during the pandemic

2568
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,159
anyways i hope that well thank you yeah

2569
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,360
thank you there's uh i know um uh

2570
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,199
uh john if you wanna i don't it's hard

2571
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,719
to see people for you so i'm just

2572
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,639
helping uh there is another question in

2573
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:29,840
the room and we have one queued up in

2574
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,280
matrix as well so let's hear from the

2575
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,280
question in the room please

2576
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,679
so far as i could tell this sounds like

2577
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,440
a story of a lot of systematic things

2578
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,679
where people kind of grasp their hands

2579
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,440
and say oh no but

2580
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,199
the structure of the company and all of

2581
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,120
the environments you are in were really

2582
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,960
moving against you

2583
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,239
in your time

2584
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,920
sort of after this

2585
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,239
or even during did you have any thoughts

2586
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,120
on

2587
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,159
what larger companies could do

2588
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,120
to try to make sure that when

2589
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,440
completely unexpected hazards come up

2590
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,400
like this they have any structure to be

2591
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,360
able to deal with them reasonably

2592
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,360
if that question makes sense

2593
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,080
i think so so i would so talk so i'm

2594
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,760
going to break this down to what i

2595
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,800
personally see as a systematic failures

2596
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,639
that we could that we could reasonably

2597
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,600
expect facebook to have avoided

2598
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,199
and and

2599
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,719
and and i'm going to point to two

2600
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,639
separate categories for this

2601
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,360
the first the first of them it's just

2602
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,880
for that competitive political

2603
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,480
interference because at facebook

2604
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,719
the people making decisions about what

2605
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,520
the rules are on the platform

2606
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
are the same people as those who decide

2607
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,840
how the rules should be interpreted in

2608
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,239
in prominent cases for the same people

2609
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,159
who are charged with loving politicians

2610
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,040
and

2611
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,320
important people and keeping a good

2612
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,480
relationship with them so basically it's

2613
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,800
the legislative branch judiciary branch

2614
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,520
and lobbyists combined in to the policy

2615
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,840
people who you may have heard of

2616
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,719
and

2617
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:03,760
and

2618
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,080
so here in the united states if a judge

2619
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,080
is called upon to try a case and it

2620
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,600
turns out that they're close friends

2621
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,520
with the defendant they might be asked

2622
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,360
to recuse themselves in favor of the

2623
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,520
judge who isn't at facebook it would be

2624
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,440
the reverse a judge who didn't know the

2625
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,960
defendant would be called upon to give

2626
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,920
it over to someone who knew the

2627
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,360
defendant who was friends with him

2628
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,120
ideology who had to play golf with them

2629
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,800
every week so that they could know them

2630
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,320
better and this is very atypical as i

2631
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,719
understand it

2632
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:33,040
that facebook that has this organization

2633
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,360
i'm told that twitter doesn't do this i

2634
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,480
haven't worked at twitter so i don't

2635
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,920
know personally this is what i'm told

2636
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,760
that twitter keeps their lobbying

2637
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,440
department and they will decide whether

2638
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,520
the rules department are separate like

2639
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,360
facebook is a company but so is for

2640
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,800
instance the new york times the

2641
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,280
washington post and these genuinely do

2642
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,440
not make a common practice of killing a

2643
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,080
story because a politician complained at

2644
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,080
facebook that happens so often that

2645
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,159
happens in analogy so often that it's

2646
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,520
day to day

2647
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,679
and so i mean i'm not the only person to

2648
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,159
have pointed this out i think alex damos

2649
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,840
summit chakrabarti

2650
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
have done so as well and this and so

2651
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,760
this is a core problem in how facebook

2652
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,560
was organized it because

2653
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,719
like in some cases

2654
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:16,639
i think it was probably the key one of

2655
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,440
the key issues in my work in india

2656
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,360
in in other cases in in other cases i

2657
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,000
got pushback because i was because

2658
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
because i was accused of being

2659
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,080
because because people were like we

2660
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,600
should we should we should protect the

2661
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,000
rights of the users by not directly not

2662
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,520
cracking down on them right away and

2663
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,920
giving them warnings and etc and that

2664
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,199
it's

2665
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,360
based on a dynamic in which the police

2666
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,760
officer is expected to be friends with

2667
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,920
the person that they charged with

2668
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,760
overseeing

2669
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,120
the second point that they would point

2670
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,560
to is that

2671
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,920
for the acrobatic work facebook is too

2672
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,760
quantitatively focused they focus like

2673
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,440
money type companies they're very number

2674
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,480
driven they like to do metrics or apis

2675
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,440
and sorry the okay the kpis whatever

2676
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,120
okay

2677
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,480
you can tell it's been involved since i

2678
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,679
have actually worked as a data scientist

2679
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:10,960
and

2680
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,080
and and and and and and people and

2681
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,199
people like being able to report that by

2682
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:18,800
in my work in this company i have

2683
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,239
increased our core metric by 10.6

2684
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,159
or something like that the flip side of

2685
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,000
that is that when you focus on that you

2686
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,080
you do not focus on what cannot be

2687
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,199
measured and that is a lot of the issue

2688
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,440
that i think facebook is having that it

2689
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,000
is focused on reactivity

2690
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,560
rather than proactivity because in this

2691
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,199
analogy degrading a fire department on

2692
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,360
how many fires they put out

2693
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,880
without considering how many fires were

2694
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,040
prevented in the first place like fire

2695
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,880
departments used to be paid on how many

2696
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,880
fires they put out i think some of them

2697
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,520
started studying fires at that point

2698
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,639
and

2699
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,280
like like i was like i was i was told i

2700
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,840
mentioned that i was told that

2701
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,679
that this wasn't important to facebook

2702
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,360
because if it was it would blow up and

2703
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,719
become the news and that would cause

2704
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,560
facebook to pay attention and that

2705
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,120
reflects a fundamentally short-sighted

2706
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,520
bias that that doesn't try to focus on

2707
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,120
prevention like facebook has really

2708
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,199
stopped trying to prevent bad news

2709
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,800
cycles i mean it's gotten used to them

2710
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,480
like there's so many bad news cycles

2711
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,239
they don't even try to stop them anymore

2712
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,560
but frankly i was surprised when they

2713
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,480
came forward when she came forward that

2714
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,239
francis wasn't caught

2715
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,719
looking looking through documentation

2716
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,800
and and i think that's because facebook

2717
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,400
has a lot of very smart security people

2718
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,960
who look to and catch people who leak to

2719
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,000
the press

2720
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,239
the reason i i personally think she

2721
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,760
wasn't called is that those people like

2722
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,040
the rest of the company are not

2723
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,239
proactive they are focused on their

2724
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,400
quantitative measures and they aren't

2725
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,000
focused on preventing leaks before they

2726
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,360
happen because you can't prove them and

2727
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,159
you don't get rewarded for that and so

2728
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:53,600
the greater funding leaks after they

2729
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,520
have happened but she she just got

2730
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,719
everything and then came forward and

2731
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,400
then they're like well what can we do i

2732
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,840
mean at least that's my guess i can't

2733
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,239
read minds and so those are the two

2734
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,000
points i would point to internally

2735
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,320
within the company

2736
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,320
with the broader structural issue the

2737
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,920
one that they pointed to was the

2738
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,400
information gap that that

2739
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,080
that this is really an

2740
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,320
an economist required an externality

2741
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,159
problem coupled with information

2742
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,360
asymmetry

2743
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,840
in in layman's terms the costs of this

2744
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,159
are paid by society but not if not by

2745
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,400
facebook and society doesn't know about

2746
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,040
this only facebook does and and which is

2747
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,120
why my testimony when i testified for

2748
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,040
instance to the british parliament and

2749
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,600
etc i suggested that they focus on red

2750
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,520
team-style penetration tests so that

2751
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,679
they could try and actually hold the

2752
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,280
company accountable by knowing what's

2753
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,719
actually going on hope that makes sense

2754
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,120
yes thank you

2755
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,280
another question from matrix

2756
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,840
would like you to dwell further into the

2757
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
emotional toll here and it's asking

2758
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,360
whether you have any resources or

2759
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,280
techniques that you use to deal with

2760
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,120
facing some of these

2761
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,199
you know impacts

2762
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,280
i use the techniques and resources of

2763
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,239
petting my cats having my cat on my lap

2764
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,560
and cutting in my girlfriend she's great

2765
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,280
i mean i don't know

2766
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,239
excellent answer i mean i i mean i i

2767
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,920
used to talk i used to talk to a

2768
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,080
therapist i mean i stopped talking i

2769
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,800
stopped talking to them halfway half

2770
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,120
halfway through this started going on

2771
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,800
just because either i couldn't tell her

2772
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,280
about what was happening because

2773
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,360
boy because i would feel like i was i

2774
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,280
don't know i was afraid that she would

2775
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,480
think that it was

2776
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,920
delusional or something because it

2777
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,400
sounds a bit that way

2778
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,080
like margaret menstrual effect or

2779
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,080
something like that

2780
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,400
my my great metro was the what was the

2781
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,920
wife of a cabinet member during the

2782
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,840
nixon administration who was who was

2783
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,920
like put in a psychiatric ward after she

2784
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,040
said the president's people were

2785
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,400
following her and eve dropping on her

2786
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,119
and

2787
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,719
i i might have

2788
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,760
misforgot forgotten her name anyways

2789
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,920
and anyways i thought about getting star

2790
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,040
repressed again but i mean with risk

2791
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,840
i don't do well with i don't like

2792
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,400
video calls and etc and i'm vic and

2793
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,000
they're not super comfortable it's in

2794
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,320
person right now so i keep

2795
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,400
procrastinating i suppose

2796
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,400
and yeah like

2797
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,760
i

2798
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,280
i have talked to somebody supporter

2799
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,880
eight organizations some have been more

2800
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,280
helpful than others

2801
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,400
but

2802
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,600
every reason i do

2803
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,440
like a reason i do is basically like in

2804
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,280
terms of actual organization responding

2805
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,760
to people and doing interviews et cetera

2806
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,840
just by myself without prop without

2807
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,199
without supporting us you can't my

2808
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,400
girlfriend my cats they're great

2809
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,199
there's a question in the room also

2810
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,600
i have a technical question about your

2811
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,040
methodologies

2812
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,320
you relied on metadata uh internal

2813
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,119
metadata about i presume registrations

2814
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,480
and behavior

2815
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,840
but did you use any stylometrics

2816
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,639
on the content of the postings there was

2817
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,639
the leverage effect caused by additional

2818
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:01,600
likes

2819
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,400
and you know all of that leverage stuff

2820
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,239
but if there was

2821
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,560
actual independent content did you try

2822
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,040
to analyze it for similarity clustering

2823
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,400
or

2824
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,639
you know central sources attributing it

2825
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,880
it's okay so i'm going to try to break

2826
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,960
that down firstly

2827
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,520
so i realized i relied on metadata that

2828
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,840
did not look into content i think you

2829
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,239
asked about doing similarity analysis on

2830
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,440
content

2831
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,880
that is something that i did not

2832
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,719
personally do but people within the

2833
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,800
company have done

2834
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,280
this is like most machine learning or ai

2835
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,520
not super necessarily super effective

2836
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,840
because because i mean sure you can

2837
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
think it's obvious if everyone starts po

2838
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,600
if a lot of people start posting this

2839
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,440
string or at the same time it might be

2840
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,880
suspicious

2841
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,040
here's an example of a string that was a

2842
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,119
false positive people saying happy

2843
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,759
thanksgiving

2844
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,000
and and so like this was this was an act

2845
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,920
i mean actual example from like five

2846
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,520
years ago or something like it was

2847
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,520
before my time and and so this is

2848
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,960
something that people within the company

2849
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,400
do they do

2850
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,159
i did not work on a team will work very

2851
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,480
closely but sometimes like for instance

2852
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,880
when facebook takes takes down it takes

2853
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,719
down links that are false positives it's

2854
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:17,119
this in action

2855
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,960
because with hundreds of

2856
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,480
countries and

2857
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,280
more multiple hundreds of languages

2858
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,000
uh you'd need

2859
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,239
native language expertise in many of

2860
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,560
these languages to actually do content

2861
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,080
analysis

2862
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,400
so it's a real problem for every

2863
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,159
yeah yeah content provider every

2864
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:37,600
platform

2865
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,840
yeah so so i do want to pick too with

2866
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,320
regard to fake accounts and authenticity

2867
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,920
questions you don't actually need to

2868
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,639
know to know the content very much

2869
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,400
it's it's it's a question of is this

2870
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,920
person real are

2871
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,119
are they

2872
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,800
and and that's something you can figure

2873
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,520
out perfectly fine with metadata and

2874
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,440
looking at the profile most of the time

2875
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,840
that is content agnostic i mean you can

2876
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,520
look at the content to see what are they

2877
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,440
doing like that can be helpful for

2878
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,760
context but it is not important

2879
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,639
in the same way that in this in the same

2880
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,000
way that i don't know if you're looking

2881
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,080
for if if you're looking at balance box

2882
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,360
stuffing you don't need to know who the

2883
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,800
vote was cast for to know that it's a

2884
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,560
fake bandit

2885
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,440
and

2886
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,320
and

2887
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,239
and so this i mean i certainly don't

2888
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,480
speak azeri i can speak one phrase in

2889
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,639
spanish which is a story according to

2890
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:29,159
elgato which means i am petting my cat

2891
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,960
[Applause]

2892
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,320
and

2893
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,400
and i relied upon google translate and

2894
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,719
wikipedia at times i actually considered

2895
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:41,119
this an advantage because i was because

2896
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,880
i was certain that i was not being

2897
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,400
politically biased

2898
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,159
because i did not need to know who this

2899
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,639
person was i had no clue who they were

2900
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,320
and i was making my decisions regardless

2901
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,000
of that it was

2902
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,840
and all i needed to know was are these

2903
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,360
accounts fake are the people they're

2904
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,719
supporting politicians yes good done

2905
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,800
and i hope that makes sense yeah but my

2906
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,040
related question has to do with the page

2907
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,679
concept of page

2908
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,239
so so the so the way that pages work on

2909
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,600
facebook is that a user controls that

2910
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,920
page so for instance i don't have a

2911
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,360
facebook account anymore but suppose i

2912
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,400
do i'm sophie john i can control page

2913
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,239
young very graciously gives me control

2914
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,480
of the public page i i am not young but

2915
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,920
they have given me permission to post

2916
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,840
things with yandhru it's public page and

2917
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,600
they also do things with i don't know

2918
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,600
someone else who does it and that's fine

2919
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,280
a single person can control a lot of

2920
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,719
pages

2921
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,960
i mean oftentimes like maybe maybe there

2922
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,760
maybe there's a page for for for hope

2923
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,560
and there's a page for new hope 2022 i

2924
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,159
mean it would be reasonable for the same

2925
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:53,199
person to control both of these pages

2926
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,920
and that's the intended purpose the side

2927
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,080
effect is that this is also a great

2928
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,800
this is also a super easy way to not to

2929
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,480
to switch between

2930
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,480
a thousand and fake assets without even

2931
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,639
needing to bother to dock in and out

2932
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,880
there's a i think a last question here

2933
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,400
and then we'll wrap up for the session

2934
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,159
you might have a few closing remarks

2935
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,600
this also came in through matrix it's a

2936
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,560
little related to what we were just

2937
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,639
talking about and it pains a dichotomy

2938
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,159
that uh first of all i'd like to see if

2939
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:21,840
you agree with this dichotomy but it

2940
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,840
says there's a

2941
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,480
tension between privacy and authenticity

2942
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,400
the idea being that you need to ask more

2943
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,320
and more potentially private information

2944
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,840
which i think you just refuted but you

2945
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,960
have to ask more and more private

2946
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,280
information uh to figure out who someone

2947
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,920
is and there's this there's this tension

2948
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,040
so uh

2949
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,560
do you agree with that dichotomy and how

2950
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,960
do you see uh resolution or do you see

2951
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,719
that there's a i think the real question

2952
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,719
from matrix is what maybe is the right

2953
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,440
balance yeah absolutely so i think there

2954
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,159
is a partial level there this dichotomy

2955
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,320
because it's partially it's my personal

2956
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,880
belief because i mean

2957
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,320
like anonymity by itself does it it

2958
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,600
it isn't

2959
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,880
isn't and it isn't an issue for

2960
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,639
the classical star of fake accounts it's

2961
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,800
fine if you have one account

2962
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,080
if you have multiple accounts if they

2963
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,000
don't interact with each other if you

2964
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,679
have one account that's that that's

2965
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,440
personal things and one account that's

2966
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,440
professional things that that is in

2967
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,560
theory

2968
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,119
theoretically philosophically fine but

2969
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:22,960
where you start getting into issues is

2970
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,480
if you start having the accounts

2971
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,080
interact with each other and pretend to

2972
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,760
be separate people you have your

2973
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,679
accounts engaging in a conversation on

2974
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,119
someone else's

2975
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,800
where you pretend to convince someone

2976
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,960
who's actually just yourself if you have

2977
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,400
if you have them start sharing each

2978
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,960
other's content if you start having

2979
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,119
if you start having them

2980
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:45,199
if you start having them uh i don't know

2981
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,520
the same scene and post the same thing i

2982
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,679
mean that's i mean that does sound that

2983
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,159
does also create your anonymity because

2984
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,760
you're doing the same thing with summit

2985
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,520
but and it also

2986
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,440
but it would also make this increasingly

2987
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,239
bad the area that i would say the area

2988
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,280
that i would say is that they do bad up

2989
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,880
against each other somewhat has to do

2990
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,040
with enforcement

2991
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,679
so usually at facebook the standard

2992
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,920
response if you're pretty if you're very

2993
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,760
search for if you're almost certain that

2994
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,199
an account is fake

2995
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:18,239
it's that you send it through a bunch of

2996
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,080
checklists in which you require them to

2997
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,480
provide edit identification so when

2998
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,320
people say facebook wanted my passport

2999
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,560
facebook wanted my id this is what

3000
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,960
happens because i mean ml is not perfect

3001
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,119
it makes mistakes if if you don't have

3002
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,400
any false positives that means you're

3003
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,719
not being aggressive enough

3004
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,440
and but and and the flipped and and so

3005
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,760
the and so this does have the advantage

3006
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,600
of

3007
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,280
because facebook it has a real name

3008
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,440
policy it can afford to do this it can

3009
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,600
in a way that i i that might not quite

3010
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,520
work for 22. i don't know how to do this

3011
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,840
i'm speculating here but the point is

3012
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,320
that this allows facebook

3013
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,480
to do things with greater precision than

3014
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,639
would then would be possible if if they

3015
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,360
did not have the ability the ability to

3016
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,679
ask people for profile pic for pro for

3017
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:05,440
ids and et cetera

3018
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,679
just because otherwise there would be

3019
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:09,360
more people easier more people

3020
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,280
incorrectly swept up or they would take

3021
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,000
down fewer fake profiles

3022
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,560
and and and so and so that's an example

3023
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,360
of

3024
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,840
where the dichotomy of the dichotomy

3025
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,080
intention lies

3026
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,119
like

3027
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,800
like they have like there have been a

3028
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
lot of discussion about about about

3029
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,520
privacy like i believe elon musk has

3030
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,600
advocated for authenticating everyone on

3031
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,280
twitter

3032
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,880
my i mean

3033
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,440
a lot of this is tied to this to the to

3034
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,199
the stereotype that fake accounts are

3035
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,600
responsible for a large proportion of

3036
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,000
hate speech misinformation etc which

3037
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,760
like most stereotypes is completely

3038
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,679
incorrect

3039
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,880
like

3040
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,119
like i mean

3041
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:52,560
unfortunately

3042
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,400
most people who share hate speech and

3043
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,159
misinformation are people who genuinely

3044
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:57,920
believe it like countries have

3045
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,760
experimented with authenticating

3046
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,800
everyone if south korea did it for for a

3047
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,280
number of years it reduced the number of

3048
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,360
hateful content by like maybe five

3049
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,679
percent i think and it also resulted in

3050
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,600
the leak of most south koreans personal

3051
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,520
information when the when the companies

3052
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,719
that were storing the personal

3053
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,040
information got hacked

3054
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:17,760
and

3055
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,480
and

3056
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,600
and so

3057
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,040
requiring people to authenticate

3058
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,199
themselves and etc would solve exactly

3059
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,760
one problem which is fake accounts and

3060
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,040
which i mean i think a lot of people

3061
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,840
have one size fits all solutions

3062
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,280
there's also the notion that breaking up

3063
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,360
facebook would solve everything when it

3064
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,280
would solve precisely my problem which

3065
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,760
is that facebook is too powerful

3066
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,840
and i seem to have gone off on a bit of

3067
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,960
a segway here but i hope this made sense

3068
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,639
thank you we're at the end of our time

3069
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,800
i'd like to mention two things one is

3070
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,239
that our guests are here they're

3071
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,480
participating in in the event they're

3072
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,119
happy to speak with you uh politely and

3073
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,840
you know as time allows and also i think

3074
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,600
uh we'll be available just outside the

3075
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,639
hall if there's a little further

3076
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,400
discussion anyone would like to have i'd

3077
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,320
like to turn it over to both of you if

3078
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,080
you have any closing remarks or comments

3079
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,520
or things that you didn't get to say in

3080
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,400
the last bit of time together

3081
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,199
hack the planet

3082
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,800
all right thank you so much it's been a

3083
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,080
real pleasure having you on the hope

3084
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,080
stage

3085
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,520
and also you weren't watching

3086
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,920
[Music]

3087
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,000
