1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,760
do

2
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,279
uh

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
good morning everyone welcome back to

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
our last day of hope i know it's uh it's

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
sad that we're here the last day but

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
we've got another great talk lined up

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
for you right now the talk is using

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,399
security automation to organize your

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
cyber security threat intelligence

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
knowledge it will outline how the cti

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,440
open cti platform can be deployed scaled

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,199
for high availability using cloud data

13
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
strategies and utilized by strategic and

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
technical cyber threat analysts at any

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,719
seniority level

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
so we have a matrix chat thread for this

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,559
talk if you have questions especially

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,560
for the virtual audience go and enter it

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,159
into the matrix chat and when we get to

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
the qa section of this talk we'll

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
try and get your questions answered we

22
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,960
also have a qa section as a microphone

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
in back so when we get to the qa section

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
please audience members come back and

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
queue up and we'll we'll queue you up

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,400
for the speaker so with that let's

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
introduce andrew q for his talk thank

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,479
you

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
hello good morning everybody

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
um so right off the bat opinions on my

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,079
own and not the view of my employer and

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,720
should never be taken

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,920
seriously um my name is andrew um i'm

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
here because i love to give

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
give presentations or if you speak

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
minion bellow

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
so about my a few things about myself um

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,439
i was born and raised in queens not too

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,759
far from from st john's university

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
i'm currently a platform engineer for

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,439
the city of new york um some of the

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,000
things i do day to day um involve

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,560
kubernetes devsecops infrastructure as a

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,520
code

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
site reliability site reliability

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,479
engineering

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
and incident response

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
and this is my second hope in real life

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
so

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
let's let's identify the problem

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
cyber intelligence tooling is expensive

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
the licenses and subscriptions are not

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
cheap

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
um let's define cti so what is what is

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
cyber threat intelligence crowdstrike

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
defines it as in a very loose term the

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,959
collecting of possessing of the

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
analyzing of a threat actors motives

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,959
targets and attack behaviors to make

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,920
decisions using good judgments

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,959
gardner calls it hard facts backed by

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,560
evidence about existing or emerging

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,760
menaces or hazards to um to assets

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,959
so whether

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
it be like i.t computer security i.t

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
assets or it could be otics assets as

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,239
well

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
so in short to summarize the two

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,720
definitions together very loosely um

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
cyber threat intelligence is in which

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
third actors are tracked by what they

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
want what they do

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
what they have done and based strictly

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,599
on facts

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,159
so

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,879
uh like i had in the first slide um or

77
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
the first um the slide in the uh in the

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
section um we have too many vendors we

79
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,400
have too many feeds um some of these

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
names are maybe household friendly that

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
you've seen before anomaly that stream

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
third connect their intelligence

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
platform record a future is a is a big

84
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
name in cyber threat intelligence um and

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
we have palo alto um relatively new to

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
the space i um i um i'd say they're you

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
know maybe less than a year in um and

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
they integrated a threat intelligence

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
module in their um sort platform called

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
xor cortex xor

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
um and you know these these big brand

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
names used um in enterprise um they'll

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
charge an arm and leg um to use their

94
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,200
systems

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
not only do you need um

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,439
not only for um cyber threat

97
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,799
intelligence do you need a platform to

98
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
you know aggregate all your data you

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,238
also need and you also need

100
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
subscriptions and feeds you know

101
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,600
upstream so um here are a few that you

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
might you know you may also know like

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
crowdstrike intelligence and indicators

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
recorded future has wonderful streams

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
and threat feeds

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
msi fsisac if you're into like the

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
government space financial services

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
space

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
um mandiants bought by google and

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
previously known as or separated from

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
fireeye

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
alto's unit 42 third research group has

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
has

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
good threat feeds

115
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
and url house and um you know there may

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,479
be others

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
and each of these um each of these fees

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
each of these vendors whether or not who

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,680
you pick if you want like you know high

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
fidelity data and whatnot um you know

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
these feeds cost

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
you know thousands of dollars hundreds

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,759
of dollars in order to be a subscriber

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,759
of

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,039
and so um

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,880
knowledge is power powers knowledge you

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
can't you can't run you can't do you

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
know cyber threat intelligence if you

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,199
don't have

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
uh if you don't have the knowledge and

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
you can't have you can't uh conduct

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
cyber threat intelligence if you don't

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,758
have the power

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
so let's identify the solution right

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,639
enterprise cyber threat intelligence is

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
way too expensive so let's make it let's

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,639
make it cheaper enterprise cyber threat

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
intelligence doesn't have to be

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,320
expensive

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,880
so the the main the main topic that i'm

141
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
going to speak about today um is to

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
introduce you guys to um opencti opencti

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,320
is an open source free to use

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
cyber threat intelligence platform you

145
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
can find on github

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,520
it's

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
created by these lovely

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
individuals

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
outside

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
located in france paris

151
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,639
um

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
they operate under the um the uh the

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
non-profit organization called luitix

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
and they've been working on this product

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,919
for about

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
two to three years

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,199
um

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
and um they've just been making huge um

159
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
groundbreaking groundbreaking uh waves

160
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
in the space in order to make cyber

161
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
threat intelligence um you know open to

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
all free to use to all without the

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,039
limitations of like cost or anything

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
so about opencti

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
it's an open source comprehensive

166
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
platform that allows organizations to

167
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
manage structure store organize and

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,080
visualize their cyber threat

169
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
intelligence knowledge and observables

170
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
it uses a modern text stack

171
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
front end is written in reactant node

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
used back in python use graphql for

173
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
or it's api

174
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
um it's database you can use

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,520
elasticsearch or open search if you'd

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
like um

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
it uses a rabbitmq for its messaging

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
queue to um

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
to designate work and tasks

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,840
and use redis as a cache

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,880
for

182
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
you know non-persistent um

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,359
non-persistent stor storage

184
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
and um to reiterate it's open source

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
community empowered and free so you know

186
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
if you if there's a

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
you know develop the developers lunatics

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
um that make the program or that make

189
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,680
the platform um they have this policy

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
where if there is a you know if there's

191
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,240
a bug in the general release they'll try

192
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
to fix it within 24 hours

193
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,879
communities community suggestions um are

194
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,520
welcomed um if you if you use the

195
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
platform and you realize that you know

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
there there could be a like a you know

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
great idea that you know that would work

198
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
really well in the ecosystem you could

199
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,639
just submit like a feature request

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,080
and you know they'll respond really

201
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,479
quickly

202
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,318
and most importantly it's free

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
so um the core the core functionality of

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
the platform divides into essentially

205
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
three parts um the first being the

206
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
ability to organize and manage your

207
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
knowledge so

208
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,319
you know you as

209
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
you know uh an info an infosec team may

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
have you know intelligence people

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
working under you and you know your

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,599
intelligence team will have to you know

213
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
save their work do their work conduct

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
their research be able to you know

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
deliver deliverables in in you know one

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,640
sense or another

217
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
uh the platform the second core

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,519
functionality of the platform is to

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,120
visualize and graph um the knowledge

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
that you accumulate so the ability to

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,279
you know draw pretty pictures make

222
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,440
pretty relationships between you know um

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
your threat actors you

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
the threat tools that your threat actors

225
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,399
use and the targets the targeted

226
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
entities that your threat actors

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
target

228
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
and the third functionality is to

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
aggregate what you know what others know

230
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,040
and what you want to share to others so

231
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
the ability to essentially you know pull

232
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
upstream from crowdstrike from record a

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
future from mandiant from palo alto and

234
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
be able to

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
um you know save it um you know

236
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,200
on your premise um and have and also

237
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,519
have the ability you know to share the

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,160
data that you collect harvest ingest

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
analyze uh validate um to

240
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
downstream clients whether it be other

241
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
infosec teams within your organization

242
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,519
organizations whether it be other

243
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,160
infosec teams or cti teams and other

244
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
organizations or parent organizations

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
partner organizations and things like

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
that

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
um so we'll talk about

248
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
the first core functionality which is

249
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
organizing your knowledge um

250
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,839
cti for cyber threat intelligence you

251
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
can say that you can break it down into

252
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,880
two

253
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
two components two schools of thought

254
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
essentially

255
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
strategic versus

256
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,160
technical

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,279
where um first

258
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
for strategic cti right it's mainly

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,079
about knowledge about your threats um

260
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
the threat tools that your threats use

261
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,680
and related entities that are targeted

262
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,959
by your um

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
by your threat actors

264
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
so um so your threats could come in you

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,320
know

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600
a variety of you know come in a variety

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
of forms right whether they be like

268
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,279
threat actors meaning

269
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,640
um you know russian fsb iranian military

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,600
um

271
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
korean korean peoples

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
the korean the kpa um you know the

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,839
chinese army and things like that

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
intrusion sets are more along the lines

275
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
of like

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
um your apts your worms your spiders

277
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
your bears

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
um things like things of that nature

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,839
not necessarily tied to you know an

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
organized real world um

281
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
uh entity

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
um and campaigns meaning you know things

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
like uh real world events like you know

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
upright government uprisings government

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
elections

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,079
um

287
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,120
big events in nature like solar winds um

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
things like that

289
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,519
threat tools

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
so um

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
strategic cti

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
threat tools fall under the strategic

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
cti through the use of you know keeping

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,959
track of the malware which is which are

295
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,640
you know the motion software that your

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
their actors are deploying whether it be

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
ransomware trojans worms etc

298
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
um the attack patterns which correspond

299
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,760
to

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,920
your miter attack framework um and

301
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,040
things like that

302
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
um courses of action which is minor

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,360
attack which is like you know minor

304
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
attack techniques and patterns but

305
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
without the miter attack

306
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
you know

307
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
identifying schema

308
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,320
tools so you know your cobalt strikes

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
your metasploit

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
your your empire your bloodhound tools

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
that your threat actors use um you know

312
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
in order to conduct their business

313
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
and of course you can't forget about

314
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,600
vulnerabilities right you have your

315
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
after all your throat actors are um

316
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
are um

317
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
are uh you know using are uh hitting

318
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
your um

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
or using vulnerability or using

320
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
vulnerabilities to their advantage um

321
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
and they're tracked by you know the cves

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,639
and things like that

323
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
so targeted entities targeted entities

324
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,240
falls under um countries cities

325
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
organizations and individuals pretty

326
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
self-explanatory usually um these would

327
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
be the you call it the victimology the

328
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
victims of of attacks and of threat

329
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
actors and and things of that nature

330
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
um and so we'll move on to the technical

331
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
cyber threat or cyber

332
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
technical the technical component of

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
cyber threat intelligence which is um i

334
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
guess probably what most people would

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
would allude to when you think about you

336
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,519
know cyber threat intelligence and

337
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
things like that which were just

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
observables artifacts and indicators you

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
know your ips domains url hashes email

340
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,639
email addresses

341
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,160
file names and things like that

342
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
so

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
um opencti the opencti platform will

344
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
aggravate all your strategic knowledge

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,639
as well as your as well as your

346
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
technical knowledge and kind of like you

347
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
know put it all in a single pot and for

348
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
you to draw relationships or

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
automatically have the platform draw

350
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
relationships for you in order to

351
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
organize your data

352
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
but how can it be done right

353
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,399
and this is where

354
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,839
um

355
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
we we take you know devops into the mix

356
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
how can we deploy um

357
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
opencti you know whether it be you on

358
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
your home lab for your organization

359
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,199
um for your own use for that matter

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
so score ecosystem like i mentioned

361
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
before um you know uses open source

362
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
tools and technologies

363
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
we have elasticsearch or open search for

364
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
your um for your persistent database you

365
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,639
know everything everything gets uh

366
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
written and read into it

367
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
um

368
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
redis keeps track of your um your

369
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,959
your cash your non-persistent storage

370
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
stores that you know

371
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,199
that doesn't need to be saved

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
um we have uh min io um

373
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,399
which essentially is just like a front

374
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,199
end for for s3 buckets um but anything

375
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
with like uh you know xml s3 xml api can

376
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
work as well so you could use google

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,760
cloud storage you could use azure

378
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
we have rabbitmq

379
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
you know open source amqp platform

380
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
to handle events

381
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,079
and we have a few openctac components um

382
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
which are made of

383
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,399
the react front end um graphql back end

384
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
um python connectors and python workers

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,519
so um for the last few bits you know

386
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,639
everything is

387
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,040
um strives to be like a micro service

388
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,719
oriented environment

389
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
but wait how can it be scaled how well

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,120
does the scale

391
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,040
so yes everything that you just saw in

392
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
the in the graph um in the graph in the

393
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
previous in the previous slide um could

394
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
be scaled for high availability for high

395
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
availability for example um

396
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
elasticsearch you could use a multi-node

397
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,399
cluster multi-regional cluster you know

398
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
to prevent outages you know

399
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
pump up as many replicas primaries as

400
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
you want rollovers and things like set

401
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
up index rollovers um uh

402
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,399
uh you know snapshots hot and cold hot

403
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
warm and cold indexes in order to keep

404
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
your you know the most frequently

405
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,519
accessed data um you know in hot

406
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
and keep your you know less used data in

407
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,279
cold so that you aren't you know using

408
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,480
crazy amounts of resources for

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
elasticsearch

410
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,199
redis can be also configured for high

411
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,440
availability high availability you can

412
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
use a multi multi-node redis instance um

413
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
that's perfectly fine it'll be resilient

414
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
to you know regional

415
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
regional downtime or zonal downtime if

416
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,240
you're in the cloud

417
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
grab mq like like i said before you

418
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
could you know you could also set up a

419
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
multi-null cluster for rabbitmq in the

420
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
events you don't want you know just

421
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
because your rabbitmq goes down doesn't

422
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,519
mean that your platform would stop you

423
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
know without processing tasks and things

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
like that

425
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
and min io which you can you know if you

426
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,600
have the ability to um uh

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
you know have access to an s3 buckets

428
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,519
whether it be like aws gcp or azure um

429
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
you'd have you know the

430
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,240
the cloud platforms um

431
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,120
word of like you know

432
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,519
99.9999 percent availability uptime um

433
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,959
which translates to about like you know

434
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,639
a handful of hours of downtime every

435
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,639
year

436
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
and the opencti ecosystem itself meaning

437
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
the platform the workers

438
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
the connectors

439
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,199
they're all stateless in nature they

440
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,360
don't hold any states if they

441
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
they go down your data won't you know

442
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
disappear as long as you know

443
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,400
everything's being written into

444
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
elasticsearch as long as you're

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
saving it to a persistent a persistent

446
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
disk um

447
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
you won't have to worry

448
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,400
um the opencti ecosystem is essentially

449
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
built off of like container technology

450
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
um so that you know everything is

451
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
micro serviced

452
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
everything is partitioned um you can

453
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,319
spin up whatever you want however you

454
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
want um you could configure you know how

455
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,679
you need

456
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,720
you know

457
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
100 front ends to service your clients

458
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
you're sure why not it's fine because

459
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
you know the data is being um uh written

460
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,280
and read and written into alaska search

461
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
anyways if you need you know if you see

462
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
a spike in

463
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,000
um

464
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
in the demand of your of your cti team

465
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
you know if they need to do you know

466
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
something um resource intensive you can

467
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,120
spin up more workers more consumers in

468
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
order to um get their work done um

469
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,240
during you know the rush

470
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,280
so adoption right um i talked about how

471
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
to what our um what the problem was what

472
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,880
the solution is

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,520
um gave you guys a little bit of of a

474
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,559
brief

475
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,880
a brief introduction about the um open

476
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
cci platform

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
um and i also you know describe to you

478
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
guys how to briefly you know deploy it

479
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
in your home labs um

480
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
you know organization workspace

481
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,400
environments and things of that nature

482
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
let's talk about you know if you even if

483
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,760
you didn't have a cti team in your

484
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
organization or you're thinking about

485
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
you know um spinning up a

486
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,120
cti team um

487
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,559
how would you

488
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
operationalize opencti

489
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,039
within your cti teams or infosec teams

490
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,960
if you don't already have a cti team

491
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,760
so

492
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
um

493
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
this is what

494
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
essentially what the platform would look

495
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,919
like the moment you know from a clean

496
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
slate you essentially have nothing right

497
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,760
um

498
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
how would you

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,120
the main question would be like you know

500
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,559
um how would you

501
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
um

502
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
uh pull data from upstream from your

503
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
vendors from your subscriptions from

504
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
your thread feeds have it all you know

505
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
pumped into the platform and then have

506
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
your um you know technical analyst

507
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
strategic analysts um you know go on the

508
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
platform and be able to you know conduct

509
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
their work

510
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
because at the end of the day right you

511
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
want your platform to look something

512
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
like this where you know you have you

513
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,760
know pretty graphs pretty lines um big

514
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
numbers things to show you know upper

515
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
management um you know

516
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
uh prove the proof of upper management

517
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
you know you're keeping track of like

518
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
you know you know thousands of thread

519
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,840
actors thousands of threats um and you

520
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
know have a running database of like all

521
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,919
the tools that um that you've seen that

522
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
you know that your

523
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,200
partners know and things of that nature

524
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
so um

525
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
you can't have a home without any

526
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
furniture right you can have a bare

527
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
metal shell um but if you don't have

528
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
your you know if you don't have like

529
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,320
connectors or enrichment or

530
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,360
um

531
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
ingestion um you won't be able to

532
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
um function really

533
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,559
um so a few instruction injection

534
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,120
connectors break into three parts which

535
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
are internal enrichment internal import

536
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
external import so internal enrichment

537
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,039
essentially just means that you know you

538
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
have a

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
ip or domain or a url you're unsure you

540
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
know you're unsure if it's like benign

541
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
or malicious or not yeah you can you

542
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
know go on virustotal you could type it

543
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,159
in whatever um but you know we we want

544
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,840
to try to like automate the process so

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,080
like if the ipv the url of the domain is

546
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
already on your platform you know from

547
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,039
somewhere whether it be like you know

548
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
uploaded um from somewhere um or you

549
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
know manually put in um

550
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,280
you'd be able to you know

551
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
uh run like a virus like a virus total

552
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,400
query lookup you'd be able to query

553
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
any any service that you have that you

554
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
have an api key for for the most part

555
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,799
you know to learn about you're more

556
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,799
about your entity

557
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,039
we have internal imports um which means

558
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
that you know in the event um

559
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
your team is not as super technical like

560
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,360
the way that you guys receive

561
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,520
information is through like newsletters

562
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
or like email or something like that or

563
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
maybe you have like pdfs or documents

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
that people send you about threat

565
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,520
reports and things like that internal

566
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
import just means that you can take you

567
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
know

568
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,240
knowledge and reports um manually and

569
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,480
you can upload them onto the platform

570
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,240
for the platform to like you know ingest

571
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
break down and parse

572
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
we have the external import

573
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
which

574
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
as it implies we'll

575
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,039
communicate upstream you know to your

576
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
vendors um

577
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,080
you know it'll constantly pull um for

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,039
uh

579
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,480
pull your vendors like threat fees and

580
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
subscriptions in order for you to get

581
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,919
the most recent indicators the most

582
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
recent um

583
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,240
threat actors and relationships and how

584
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
and even reports as well

585
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
and for e-justin

586
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
because you know you have you know open

587
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
cci shouldn't be your shouldn't be the

588
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
you know last station of the of the

589
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
routes in which your data flows from

590
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
upstream to downstream open cci could be

591
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,000
in the middle ground where um other um

592
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
other instances other clients it doesn't

593
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
have to be open cti you can use you know

594
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,640
any of the other vendor um

595
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
you know vendor paid paid programs um

596
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
products to hook into opencc open cti

597
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
has like a cool functionality where you

598
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
can essentially just like spin up like a

599
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
taxi you know uh threat feed and be able

600
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
to like whatever whatever data that

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
matches whatever filter um that hits

602
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,799
your platform you can just like ship it

603
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
off you know export it you know put it

604
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
in your put it in the feed um to be

605
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,120
consumed downstream

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,080
so

607
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,120
um

608
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,000
this

609
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,679
this um

610
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,520
this diagram here just kind of

611
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,240
breaks it down even further where um

612
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
starting with on the left side we have

613
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
the external input connectors so these

614
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
are the connectors that will listen from

615
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,679
upstream so if you need you know an

616
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
updated you know uh you know they put up

617
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
they put out like a new miter attack

618
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,159
technique and you need you know you need

619
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,520
you need your platform to like run the

620
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
update your platform will automatically

621
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
be able to pull the miter attack

622
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
techniques um uh

623
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,159
the csvs the jsons you know hosted by

624
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,080
miter um from their github you know

625
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
every day or something so you get the

626
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
most up-to-date information if you need

627
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,799
like

628
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,679
um

629
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,679
you know whatever taxi servers that you

630
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,919
have subscriptions to whatever taxi

631
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,559
servers that um that you that you pull

632
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,919
information out of currently you can

633
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,600
hook that into as well as an external

634
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,840
input

635
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,000
connector um

636
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
if you need an uh updated list of

637
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,480
running list of like your cves um you

638
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,279
know

639
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,600
cv 2022

640
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,760
whatever um

641
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
you can also hook that in into the into

642
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
the platform so that your platform gets

643
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
updated vulnerabilities and knowledge

644
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
about them

645
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,120
we have on the very top we have the

646
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
internal import file connector

647
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
which essentially allows you to what i

648
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
just described before the ability to

649
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,760
import um your pdfs that you receive

650
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
from you know partners over email or

651
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,360
stuff like that you could receive you

652
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,080
know

653
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,159
the you know you could turn the latest

654
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
like bleeping computer article or

655
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,279
something and adjust that into the

656
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,400
platform if it is uh relevant to you

657
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
and they'll be able to parse out your

658
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,440
your pdfs into sticks to json um you'll

659
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,159
be able to parse out your csvs into 60

660
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
json in order for it to be ingested by

661
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,120
the

662
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,480
platform um

663
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,919
right underneath we have the internal

664
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
enrichment connector um and essentially

665
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,080
it just you know it calls out to

666
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
whatever vendor solutions that you have

667
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,039
whether you have like a you know virus

668
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,279
total api key or something or if you

669
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,760
have like a you know palo alto api palo

670
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
alto auto focus wildfire api or or

671
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,039
something um and be able to you know uh

672
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,320
ask your vendor you know what do you

673
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,000
know about this ioc and they'll come

674
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
back to you with all sorts of data and

675
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
for that you can you know uh with a

676
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,799
click of a button you'd be able to like

677
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,240
save all that information onto opencti

678
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
on the right side we have the um

679
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
internal export connector um which just

680
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
parses which just parses like you know

681
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,200
csvs and um pdfs

682
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,039
into you know 62 friendly json

683
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,600
and of course you know if you have an

684
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,000
in-house like dev team you know

685
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
um to to to aid your um you know to

686
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
assist your your cti team your in-person

687
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,679
dev team would be able to you know write

688
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,279
any custom code write any custom

689
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,520
configurations took into your like

690
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
firewalls to hook into your store your

691
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
sims um in order to you know

692
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
fetch whatever data your sort and sims

693
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,039
are you know whatever is like sitting on

694
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
there and be able to like you know

695
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,760
respond back and forth like hey like you

696
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
know the sim found something let's look

697
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,799
it up on opencti opencti if opencs if

698
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,640
your opencti platform doesn't know about

699
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
it you can just you know write a

700
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,120
connector

701
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,840
to constantly pull your um you know your

702
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,080
aggregators from elsewhere um about like

703
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
new entities iocs threats and things

704
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
like that

705
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
so external import open the floodgates

706
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,240
essentially you know you'll get a ton of

707
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
data from threat feeds um from upstream

708
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
you know hundreds of thousand indicators

709
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
every hour depending on you know um what

710
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,559
you're tapping into and you have to you

711
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,279
know you don't want your your your cci

712
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,520
team to go through each indicator figure

713
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
out you know what is useful what isn't

714
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
useful you want to make sure that's you

715
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
know the indicators they stay

716
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
fresh they aren't stale you know they're

717
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,840
not they're not very useful if they if

718
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,559
they

719
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,200
um have came in like you know a year ago

720
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
you need something to you know

721
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,159
auto off-board them off your platform

722
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
just because you know indicators get

723
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,720
stale over time

724
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,279
um

725
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,480
you could get

726
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,960
external threat reports so whether you

727
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
get like a cisa advisory or like a

728
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,960
weekly report

729
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
from

730
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,960
you know from whatever government entity

731
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
that's that's giving out reports for

732
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
free um whatever roll ups whatever white

733
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,559
papers use letters and things like that

734
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
you know if it comes in pdf form you

735
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
know just pump it into the into platform

736
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,440
have the platform you know be able to

737
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,320
like you know pull out the the relevant

738
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
entities thread actors

739
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,039
indicators and save it all

740
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
and if you have data sets um you know

741
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,399
right because like the platform is just

742
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
a shell by itself without any data um if

743
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,200
you need you know uh references to your

744
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,919
miter attack techniques your cv database

745
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,520
um you could pull that from github as

746
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
well

747
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,360
so internal imports um

748
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
it's just like the importance of the

749
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,159
import

750
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,360
of reports

751
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
from your vendors from your government

752
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,919
entities from partnerships if

753
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,159
crowdstrike if mandiants if fireeye if

754
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,399
they're sending you you know

755
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,240
uh reports about threat actors and

756
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,279
things like that and you want to keep

757
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
track of it you know you don't want it

758
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
you know you know you don't want to like

759
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,279
print it out or whatever and just like

760
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,720
leave it to the side or like file it in

761
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
their file cabinets just put on open cci

762
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
it'll be your like um it'll be your file

763
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
cabinet for you

764
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,440
and you know whether it be from a taxi

765
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,200
feed or like a newsletter or a white

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
paper it'd be able to store it

767
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,240
um and the way that it would it would

768
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,320
essentially work is that um it'll parse

769
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,279
through the pdf it'll grab you know

770
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,840
they'll be able to grab

771
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,480
all the domains the urls the entities

772
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,840
and be able to save it

773
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,480
so let's take an example right let's say

774
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,440
um

775
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,399
let's say

776
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,240
uh you got this report right crosstrek

777
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
every year they'll give out for free if

778
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
you like give them like your name your

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
house number your email or stuff like

780
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,320
that they'll give you um like a global

781
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,080
threat report every year and usually

782
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,360
these these threat reports they're rich

783
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
in nature you know they're like 50 pages

784
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
long you know they've got you know the

785
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
crowdstrike stamp on it so you have you

786
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,840
know you know that it has to be

787
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
good but you don't want your cci team to

788
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
like you know you don't want them to

789
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
you know they could read it from cover

790
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
to cover but

791
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,279
you know unless they're like taking

792
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,200
notes or whatever you probably want to

793
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
you probably want to automate this

794
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
process

795
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,520
better right so

796
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,919
uh fairly simple you just like once you

797
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,840
get your pdf uh you just like upload it

798
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,720
to the platform the platform will have

799
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,200
um it will be constantly waiting for um

800
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,919
waiting for new work essentially once it

801
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,840
receives that that upload pdf which you

802
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,159
store it in your s3 buckets or min io

803
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,279
gateway um to be able to like

804
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
parse through the pdf and be able to

805
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
give you

806
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,840
um

807
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
a be able to give you like entities that

808
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,279
it found throughout your report so the

809
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
crowdstrike report um that i just

810
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,679
uploaded um will give you you know this

811
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,200
kind of uh breakdown

812
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,320
and the breakdown could sometimes be i

813
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
don't know

814
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
it doesn't show here but you know out of

815
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
that 52 page reports you know there

816
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,159
could be you know 500 entities 500

817
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
relationships about how entities relate

818
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,840
to each other and things like that

819
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,000
um uh you don't want to take

820
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
crowdstrike's word for granted and have

821
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,279
the platform just like you know create

822
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
your entities and relationships um in

823
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
which um

824
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,320
you don't want it to like what if uh you

825
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
know what if you need somebody to hold

826
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
your um hold its hand and um walk it

827
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,279
through for a little bit you want to you

828
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,120
want to be sure to validate whatever

829
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,880
findings that crosstrek is sending over

830
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
because after all you know there are

831
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,399
ones that are um writing the reports but

832
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,679
you're the ones that are ingesting it

833
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,960
and you don't want your you know your

834
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
ingestion to be you don't want your data

835
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,799
set to um

836
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,320
to go bad just because you're ingesting

837
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,559
it the wrong way so opencti it gives you

838
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,320
the functionality of pre-validating

839
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,159
anything you ingest into it whether it

840
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,120
be from the newsletter or pdf um you

841
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,360
know it'll give you it'll give you some

842
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,720
um

843
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
some drop downs and things like that and

844
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
you can um always

845
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,399
have the option to to choose not to

846
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,240
import something in just something to

847
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
choose not to build a relationship

848
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
between two entities if you do not want

849
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
to

850
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
so

851
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
after you adjust something after it runs

852
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
through the pre after you upload

853
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,760
something after you ingest it um after

854
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
you pre-validate it and validate it um

855
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
you'll end up having you know a huge

856
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,519
list of um entities you know typed to

857
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
their um

858
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,120
entity type which matches corresponding

859
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
to their sticks to um

860
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
sticks to type

861
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
and using your api calls um

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,919
uh you know if crowdstrike tells you you

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
know here are five urls that are known

864
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,159
to

865
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,000
um uh

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,399
be bad or malicious you can have your

867
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,080
security tools you know

868
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,519
uh re uh you know re-verify the data

869
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,679
that crosstrek is sending you um you

870
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,679
know upload your your urls upload your

871
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
ips and domains to virustotal you know

872
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,320
check your sandboxes hey have our um

873
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,559
have our malware analysts have our

874
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,679
reverse engineers seen this before um

875
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,320
you know if so like let us know um and

876
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,679
you'd be able to make the community you

877
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,480
know you'd be able to have open cti on

878
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,600
the platform be able to make the

879
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,919
callouts for you um in order to

880
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
do the enrichment

881
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
you can also uh use like showdown if you

882
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
want um you know look up your uh your

883
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
url see what showdown knows about you

884
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,240
from from the outs from its lens and eye

885
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,880
and

886
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
viewpoint and have it come back with

887
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
whatever data that um that it knows that

888
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,760
you think is relevant to you

889
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,440
so

890
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,159
for the ejection the ejection portion um

891
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,679
it's mainly catered towards like you

892
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,760
know other teams uh partners that you

893
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
have that you work with um or like other

894
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,799
um other event or even even vendors if

895
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,880
they want as well um so if you partner

896
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
with like industry partners or like

897
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,519
segmented segmented it teams you know if

898
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,600
they have their own instance of opencci

899
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,679
or if they have their um you know if

900
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
they use another vendor product or

901
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,159
whatever um that accepts like um

902
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,080
taxi feed streamings they could hook up

903
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
into your your platform

904
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,279
and if you ever um in the event that you

905
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,039
know in the event that there's a high

906
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,960
level high severity incident you need

907
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,799
something done quick and you need to be

908
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,039
able to give to um you know give a

909
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,200
deliverable give a presentable um to

910
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
your c-suite to your upper management in

911
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
to your upper management folks um you'd

912
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,200
be able to like ad hoc on the fly be

913
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
able to export everything you know about

914
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,720
you know an entity or threat

915
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,120
a threat group a threat actor a threat

916
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,320
tool

917
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,679
in order to you know write a report

918
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
about it

919
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,760
and the one thing that i want to um

920
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,679
uh you know emphasizes that you know

921
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,519
you'll be able to like freely share and

922
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,600
export um anything that you have on the

923
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,039
platform as long as it's like on the

924
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
platform or um already and without like

925
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,600
you know well without limitations and if

926
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,760
you run run into you know if you

927
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,840
encountered the issue of you know

928
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,079
of like resource restraints or resource

929
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,159
construction restraints then of course

930
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,119
you just like scale out

931
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,599
so after you have you know after you

932
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
have all these streams that are being

933
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
tapped into your your platform you're

934
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,000
getting all this data from upstream um

935
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,159
uh what you know what should your cci

936
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,399
team what should your cti team do with

937
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,879
it right so they could run analysis

938
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,280
right as as the

939
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,000
as a threat analyst um ideally their you

940
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
know their job description would be to

941
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,839
you know keep track of emerging threats

942
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,599
keep track of threats that are

943
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,079
persistent or have been um hitting you

944
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,320
know relevant uh sectors and um

945
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
uh relevant sectors and things like that

946
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,239
that might that may be harmful for you

947
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,000
for your organization for your parent

948
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
organization and things like that

949
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
um you can integrate um

950
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,040
you know in the event of you know of a

951
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,599
high severity incident you know uh your

952
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
incident response plan hopefully would

953
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
would um

954
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,359
there would be a section in it to engage

955
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,839
your cti team to have them threat hunt

956
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,359
about any um any uh bad actors in your

957
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,839
environment

958
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,599
a popular thing to do is to use multico

959
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,520
transforms so you know you can use

960
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
multigo

961
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,119
hook it into your you know hook it into

962
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,680
into every environment that your infosec

963
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
you know every environment that your

964
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,400
infosec team uses um including opencti

965
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
to draw the relationships between you

966
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,800
know between your source your sim um and

967
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
of course your tip now um

968
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,520
in order to enrich whatever that your

969
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,119
cci team is trying to investigate or

970
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,599
threat hunt

971
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
and of course um at the end you know you

972
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,880
write a you can have the option to like

973
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
write a report to share findings within

974
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,440
your community and you know on a you

975
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,720
know on a

976
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,800
on a granular basis be able to share it

977
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
as like a data stream um to your uh

978
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,400
to whoever is hooked into your platform

979
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,400
and what's most important um

980
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,640
that is a is a big proponent of the

981
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,839
which is a core functionality of

982
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
platform um which is to visualize your

983
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,720
knowledge graph

984
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
so this is what a knowledge graph looks

985
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,920
like from a report right we have

986
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,880
we have you know we have a ton of

987
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
clusters we have a lot of relationships

988
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,200
um the clusters you know

989
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,400
should be pretty easy to tell what a

990
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
cluster is and you also have like you

991
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,599
know these these long blue lines that

992
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,920
connect cluster to cluster um and things

993
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,359
like that

994
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,359
right but you know it's way too it's way

995
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,480
too complex um and so the the platform

996
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
makes it really easy for you to you know

997
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,880
uh uh adjust the graph adjust the view

998
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
of the graph whether you know if you're

999
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,480
not like a

1000
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,119
visual thinker or visual learner if you

1001
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
want like the hardcore you know the hard

1002
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,200
facts the hard ips

1003
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,680
the hard the hard data you can obviously

1004
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,400
choose not to use the graph

1005
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,119
but zoomed in we can see that you know i

1006
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,800
don't know if you guys could see

1007
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
um

1008
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,520
but you know we have using color

1009
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,880
coordination we have uh malware

1010
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,839
related to different

1011
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,200
file file hashes and things like that

1012
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,720
and how different malware relates to

1013
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
other malware how how it references

1014
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,720
other malware or how it targets other

1015
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
other entities so you'd be able to zoom

1016
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
in and out of the graph and play around

1017
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,720
with it to see you know on the grand on

1018
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,640
the grand scale you know what does

1019
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
crowdstrike know you know from their

1020
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,480
2021 you know global threat report or

1021
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
whatever and be able to draw a graph

1022
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,359
from their pdf reports um to to

1023
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,640
understand what they're talking about in

1024
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,040
a visual way

1025
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,079
so usage

1026
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,839
um let's run through like a demo use

1027
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,200
case um let's say um

1028
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
you want to learn more about like the

1029
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,920
cac bot the quack bot um malware which

1030
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,079
is like uh like a banking trojan that

1031
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,359
targeted like financial services

1032
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,640
companies and things like that in order

1033
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
to like harvest like user credentials

1034
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,440
and you know um

1035
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,880
uh do malicious things

1036
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
so you'd look up you probably just you

1037
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,520
know go into your platform you see hey

1038
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,960
like you know i want to learn you know

1039
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
what has crackbot done um so far so you

1040
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
look it up in your platform and you see

1041
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,640
what your platform has to say about

1042
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,839
quackbots um you know all this data

1043
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,680
the platform itself isn't making it up

1044
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,440
but it's getting from upstream from your

1045
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
um you know from your threat intel fees

1046
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,400
and things like that and your enrichment

1047
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,760
you'd be able to see you know um how

1048
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,119
often has has crackbots been seen

1049
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,359
by our by your partners from upstream

1050
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,800
you know how how often has it um been

1051
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
referenced in the reports that you have

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,800
ingested you know how often has it's

1053
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
been you know how many indicators

1054
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,000
um

1055
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
has it come from like like a like a

1056
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
threat feed um that has drawn the

1057
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
relationship between that indicator and

1058
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,119
crackbots

1059
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,079
um

1060
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,520
and things like that and you can see

1061
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,000
like you know which vendors are the ones

1062
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,320
that are mainly supplying you the data

1063
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
about what you um about what the

1064
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,200
platform rules about crackbots

1065
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
we got a few more you know a few more

1066
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
bar graphs some pretty charts

1067
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,800
for you to you know enjoy

1068
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,680
you can see you know which which uh uh

1069
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
based on the knowledge found on the

1070
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,119
platform the platform would be able to

1071
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,359
graph it graph it to you um in a visual

1072
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,960
way to indicate to you the you know

1073
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,359
which countries are being targeted by

1074
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,920
crackbots which countries are

1075
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
are related to crackbots

1076
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,440
based on all your findings that you have

1077
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,079
on the platform

1078
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,520
and again no if you choose not to you

1079
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
know if you're not a visual visual

1080
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,560
thinker if you're not a visual learner

1081
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,119
you can always just use you know

1082
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,000
plain text in order to figure out um how

1083
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
crackbot relates to like any of the

1084
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
other pieces of entities on your

1085
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
platform

1086
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
but wait you know like i said before i

1087
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
think the first couple words of my uh in

1088
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,480
my title my presentations um say

1089
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,400
security automation so um how does

1090
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,079
security automation um fit in

1091
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,920
whether or not your um you know your

1092
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
team has a sore platform or whatever for

1093
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,400
your for your sock um security

1094
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
automation you know fits in very well

1095
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
with with opencti so you know your stock

1096
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
can if your stock identifies like an ioc

1097
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,800
um that that they believe

1098
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
is malicious they'll have the ability to

1099
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
look it up and open cti and run through

1100
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
you know all the cti related tasks in

1101
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,079
order to make a determination

1102
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,079
um if you have a sandbox and your

1103
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,760
sandbox you know spits out some um

1104
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
uh you know spits out some entities that

1105
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,480
have found some hashes that had found

1106
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
you wanted to you know look it up

1107
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,160
internally on your open cci platform to

1108
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,800
see what opencci knows about the um

1109
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,119
about your uh about your hashes and

1110
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,680
things like that from upstream

1111
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,720
if you have a sim you know you can uh

1112
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
you know write a custom connection you

1113
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,599
could use a custom you could use an

1114
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,040
existing connection if they're if

1115
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,960
someone has written it out already um

1116
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
you know whatever your sim sees just

1117
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,319
look it up in your opencti platform to

1118
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,000
see you know what does openct i know

1119
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,359
about it

1120
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,640
um and one cool thing um that

1121
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
i use day to day is that like you know

1122
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,720
um in the event um there's like some hot

1123
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,160
topic whether it be like solar winds

1124
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,640
whether it be like you know ot ics um

1125
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
whether it be you know

1126
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,079
whatever uh uh log4j or um spring for

1127
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,839
shell or whatever you know if those

1128
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,960
keywords appear in the reports if any of

1129
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,560
those keywords appear um uh from uh

1130
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,720
if any new relationships are being

1131
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
created from up street from uh from a

1132
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,400
threat feed on the platform you want to

1133
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
be sure to you know alert um alert your

1134
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
your um alert your security teams like

1135
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,760
via like slack or something or like um

1136
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
microsoft teams chat or whatever and

1137
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
that would be a pretty cool way to like

1138
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,079
you know get that 24x7 eyes on glass

1139
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
without actually having someone 24 7

1140
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,240
eyes on glass you know refreshing on

1141
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,759
refreshing the ui of the platform

1142
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,200
oh whoops

1143
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
and um just because i'm like a platform

1144
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,400
engineer so i have to like you know show

1145
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,240
this portion you know use infrastructure

1146
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,079
as a code for everything right you could

1147
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,440
use deployment tooling to automate the

1148
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,960
deployment if you're on a home lab you

1149
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,160
could use like docker compose you could

1150
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,720
use like ansible puppet chef um things

1151
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
like that um i mainly operate in the

1152
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,560
cloud so i'm a huge proponent for like

1153
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,240
you know container technologies like

1154
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,319
docker podman and using kubernetes in

1155
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,160
order to orchestrate your deployment you

1156
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,280
know you'll be able to use like you know

1157
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,800
cloud technologies in order to make a

1158
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,359
really robust open source um straight

1159
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,440
from the ground up um cyber threat

1160
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,960
intelligence platform for like your

1161
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,119
infosec teams to to utilize

1162
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,599
um and of course you know like anything

1163
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,200
implement guardrails and your ci cd

1164
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
pipelines and your deployment pipelines

1165
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,839
to make sure that you aren't like

1166
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,480
deploying like bad code bad builds um

1167
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
and things like that for deployments

1168
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,960
because you don't want you don't want to

1169
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,800
purposely you know fat finger something

1170
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,960
and like you know disrupt your um your

1171
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,079
uh your your service

1172
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,119
cool so

1173
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,040
wrapping wrapping it up you know if you

1174
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,839
if

1175
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,599
if you didn't if you

1176
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,440
lost um attention um opencti is an open

1177
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,720
source community supported um platform

1178
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,319
um bustling community they have like a

1179
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,520
you know a very robust highly um highly

1180
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,800
active slack chat um many people are um

1181
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,560
are on it many newcomers are asking

1182
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,000
questions and many veterans are

1183
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
responding back

1184
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
you know it's a community supported

1185
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,839
environment

1186
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,720
and made by lutex

1187
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,240
opencta organizes your cyberthreat

1188
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,400
intelligence knowledge

1189
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,920
it connects upstream to vendors and

1190
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,960
feeds

1191
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,599
for your cti team to like uh to parse

1192
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,440
and ingest and correlate on the platform

1193
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,680
and can be connected as like uh um it

1194
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
can be connected downstream to your sims

1195
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,800
and source

1196
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,480
in order to um get to uh enable alerts

1197
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
and um and logs um uh for whoever has

1198
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,160
that 24i 247 eyes on glass stock team

1199
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,960
uh and opencti can be used um

1200
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,560
to track relationships between entities

1201
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,480
you know has crackbots

1202
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,440
um targeted france has crackbot targeted

1203
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,839
you know canada um has it has it

1204
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,000
targeted has it taught has it targeted

1205
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,480
like your um you know your it

1206
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,480
organization or whatever um and things

1207
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,960
like that

1208
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
and most importantly you know opencti is

1209
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,359
used to allow your cci team and allow

1210
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,280
your infosec teams in order to make good

1211
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,200
decisions um using good judgments

1212
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,839
so thanks that's all i have

1213
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
questions

1214
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
hi uh great talk i appreciated the

1215
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
narrative structure of the whole thing

1216
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,599
you started with a clear description of

1217
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,119
the problem and it looks like you've

1218
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,880
engineered a pretty robust solution for

1219
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,240
it for your team

1220
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
i was curious you had a lot of different

1221
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
stuff in your tech stack what were the

1222
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,920
guiding principles that you kind of

1223
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,480
followed in making those selections

1224
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,680
so on those selections um you

1225
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,359
you're kind of locked into them you have

1226
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,319
to use a lot you have to use

1227
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,640
elasticsearch you have to use um you

1228
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,119
know rabbitmq

1229
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,880
if you choose to you can you can use

1230
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,680
their um uh publicly built images of the

1231
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,960
platform and workers and things like

1232
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
that you also have the uh you know you

1233
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,839
have the options to like you know fork

1234
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,520
your own and build your own images and

1235
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,160
things like that but um uh you aren't

1236
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,000
you know if you wanted to if you choose

1237
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,200
not to use elasticsearch you can use

1238
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,040
open search if you choose not to use min

1239
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,720
io you can use your own s3 bucket you

1240
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
can use google cloud storage you can use

1241
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,200
as your

1242
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,680
azure storage as well

1243
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,078
great thanks

1244
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,160
uh thanks for the talk um

1245
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,920
so the platform seems really interesting

1246
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,000
and it's nice that it's open source

1247
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,680
but it seems to me it's going to be a

1248
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,359
limited usefulness

1249
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,000
unless you have the upstream feeds

1250
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,720
so

1251
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,560
what would you suggest for someone who

1252
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,440
was not in a you know in an enterprise

1253
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
um which

1254
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,359
which feeds should they subscribe to to

1255
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,319
sort of play with this and like how much

1256
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,920
would that cost

1257
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,480
um off the top of my head um there are

1258
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
you know there are open source um uh you

1259
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,200
know open free to use like reports that

1260
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,280
you can find on the internet you can you

1261
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,560
know always use like you know pdfs uh

1262
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,760
you could use like

1263
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,200
let me try to think

1264
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,880
i think alien vaults

1265
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,119
alienvault might be free

1266
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,079
um

1267
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,000
there are definitely some like tlp white

1268
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
sources that you can use um that pull

1269
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,800
from upstream i know miter has a miter

1270
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
has a good um

1271
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,280
good good feed um and its connection is

1272
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,359
already built into open cti

1273
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,960
um for you to pull like minor reports

1274
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,560
about threat actors and intrusion sets

1275
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,160
that mitre knows about

1276
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,079
um

1277
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,560
but other than that um you know you can

1278
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,920
always just you know generate a pdf from

1279
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
from like a from a report like maybe

1280
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
bleeping computer or something or

1281
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,079
um i don't know what another

1282
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,160
good news source is but you just pull a

1283
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,559
pdf if you see if you like it you know

1284
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,920
you just pull the pdf and just import it

1285
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,119
and just into your platform and see what

1286
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,240
your platform thinks about it

1287
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,160
all right we've got two questions from

1288
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,640
our matrix chat so we've got a number of

1289
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,319
them but we'll start with two if you

1290
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,839
have a threat actor taking actions in

1291
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,920
your environment and you take action can

1292
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,160
you record that in open cti or do you

1293
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,599
just have to use a separate ticketing

1294
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,000
system

1295
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,520
um so you know opencti unless you

1296
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,800
explicitly tell it that hey like you

1297
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,720
know a threat actor you know conducted

1298
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,880
some kind of you know operation against

1299
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
your your you know your organization's

1300
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
assets your own personal assets unless

1301
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
you explicitly tell that to open cci

1302
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,960
opencc i want to know about it

1303
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,200
um if you had like if you integrate it

1304
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,920
with like your store or sim um you know

1305
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,280
obviously if you get on a security

1306
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,119
alerts and a security alert tells you

1307
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,160
that you know

1308
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,040
some

1309
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,839
some

1310
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,640
tool is is was was used in the past like

1311
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
you know you know hour

1312
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,800
to hit like you know one of your systems

1313
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,640
you know opencti would be smart enough

1314
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,400
to be able to draw the relationships and

1315
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,319
say like hey we've seen this hash before

1316
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,119
we've seen the we've seen uh this uh

1317
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,440
signature before and it's been you know

1318
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,599
and recorded future or like crowdstrike

1319
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,359
or mitre um

1320
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,800
attributes this hash um to this threat

1321
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,559
actor like hey like you might be in some

1322
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,640
deep trouble

1323
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,839
but other than that like you know unless

1324
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,839
you explicitly tell open cci like hey

1325
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,160
like i've been hit by

1326
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,640
you know the fsb or like by an apt group

1327
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,720
or whatever um open cc i wouldn't be

1328
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,880
smart enough in order to like um make

1329
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,640
that decision the determination for you

1330
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,119
but you can

1331
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,839
all right and last question i think have

1332
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,760
you done sharing with industry partners

1333
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,280
and what challenges have you faced in

1334
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,200
doing so

1335
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
um so definitely i think

1336
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,880
um

1337
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,400
generally like people

1338
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
people don't like on unsolicited i don't

1339
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,119
know

1340
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,480
people outside of organization or like

1341
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,440
people that you don't work with day to

1342
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,240
day they might not be uh receptive of

1343
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
like unso unsolicited data like they

1344
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,839
don't care about like you know what's

1345
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,599
happening in in your neck of the voids

1346
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,079
or whatever um but i think that um

1347
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,960
because you know cti um the whole

1348
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,000
industry of like counter-threat

1349
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,960
intelligence is all about like

1350
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,040
information sharing sometimes like you

1351
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,760
know

1352
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,200
uh someone

1353
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,480
says something

1354
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,319
um and it's listen and it's heard by

1355
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,079
someone else and that person

1356
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,839
quotes the original author and someone

1357
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
quotes the original the author that that

1358
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,359
quoted the original author you get like

1359
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,680
this loop um so that's not always good

1360
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,280
um but

1361
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,520
um definitely um

1362
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,440
i think one of the big proponents of

1363
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,800
like cyber threat intelligence just like

1364
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,240
you know just be open be able to like

1365
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,880
share amongst like those you trust

1366
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,119
um and if they if you know if they want

1367
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:01,920
it

1368
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,280
they can have it but if they don't want

1369
