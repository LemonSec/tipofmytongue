29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
good evening thanks for coming

30
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079

31
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
to uh drop in here instead of hackers

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920

first off question for you and we'll

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
dive right in so i thought it was

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
appropriate for a conversation around

40
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,519
people are familiar with the superman

54
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,200
pose

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,840

goes

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
okay so um let me start off by saying

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
that this is not going to be a deeply

60
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,120
technical talk i'm not going to be

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,800
introducing new code

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
showing you

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
new exploits

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,239
or popping shells i'd love to

65
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
but i'm not going to be doing that um

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
i want to talk a little bit about how i

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,599
got to this talk and then we'll dive in

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,519
just some quick background on me again

69
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,879
my name is george

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
um

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
i've been

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
pretty much

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
unprofessionally at an amateur level

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
breaking things since

75
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
ironically enough a movie came out by

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
the same title as the conference

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
if that helps anybody date that a new

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640
hope

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
so beyond that professionally i've been

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
working in i.t and information security

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
for

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,519
over 20-25 years give or take in a

83
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
variety of different roles at a variety

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,840
of different

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,519
enterprises i did a little consulting

86
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
did a little this did a little that

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
so

88
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
um

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,319
i came to a crossroads a few years back

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
and it really came down to this it's

91
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,319
either get

92
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,599
much better

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,319
on the hands-on keyboard functions

94
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,439
or

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
start working and dealing with the

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
managerial and leadership the the team

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
building aspects of that and i spent a

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,080
lot of time thinking about what did i

99
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
really like

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,799
you know what drove me what got me

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
excited and woke up in the morning and

102
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,238
thrilled the good work and it was some

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
of the team building aspects of it

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
and

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
have had the opportunity to lead a bunch

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
of different teams i currently am

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
leading the

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
customer success

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
technical success team

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
security team at gigamont

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
and

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
really driven by what does it take to

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
build an excellent team

114
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,560
what does it take to build exceptional

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
practitioners in information security

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
and as i started thinking about it i

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
realized that

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,440
uh something had kind of gotten stuck in

119
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
my head and and there were some pretty

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
critical challenges that were we're

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
looking at we're going to talk a little

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,039
bit tonight about the scarcity the

123
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
number of empty analyst chairs

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
that has been reported so i think job

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
security but we'll talk about those

126
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
empty chairs and how we start thinking

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
about filling them and why those chairs

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
are empty

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
because that number hasn't changed in a

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
couple of years

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
so something got stuck in my head

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
at a talk at defcon

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,160
probably uh

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
six years ago seven years ago um so i'm

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
a little fuzzy on some of the

136
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,479
particulars if those of you that have

137
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
attended defcon may be familiar with

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
that mindset um it was either ddtect or

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
kenshoto during a talk about

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
what made good ctf teams and went into

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
the talk thinking it's going to be

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
different skill sets

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
on you know you need to have python you

144
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
need to have ruby you need to have

145
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
people that can do this and that

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
the thing that stuck in my head as they

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
started breaking down what made

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
successful teams was this comment that

149
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
you needed to have someone that was

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
willing to go get pizza

151
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,880
and of course

152
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
everybody kind of laughed but i started

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,919
really thinking about it and it's like

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,960
you know as a as a practitioner and as a

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
leader oftentimes if you don't have

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
someone that's willing to walk away from

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
the problem and go get food if you don't

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,479
have someone that's willing to maybe not

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,840
have the the spotlight if you will

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
so you end up sitting there and getting

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
stuck they even talked about the fact

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
that they would build things flags into

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,919
the ctf that were particularly

164
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
attractive to rock stars that would get

165
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,000
them kind of stuck

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
on that particular piece that they were

167
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
working on and basically take them out

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
of the game

169
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
so thinking a little bit about that and

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
thinking about

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
what it would take to build a

172
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,560
real world effective team a small group

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,319
within that

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
and thinking about the challenges that

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
we have the evolving threat landscape

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
the the skills gap how hard it is how

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
apparently hard it is to gain the skills

178
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
that you need to become proficient in

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
the in the role

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
um

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
i started looking around and people that

182
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
were obviously crushing it people that

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
were leading people that were doing

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
really really well on a technical level

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
on a professional level and asking

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
myself and then starting to ask them how

187
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
did you get there

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,919
what did you do how do you how do you

189
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,800
know evil when you see it and what do

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
you think the the most popular answer

191
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
that i got back was

192
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,280
that's

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
can you give her

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,280
give her a coin that's a good answer

195
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,800
so

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,840
nice

197
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
so beyond i am eagle which is a

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,719
phenomenal answer so

199
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
yeah i know it when i see it

200
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
so which is well okay how do we train

201
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,400
for that how do

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
we pass that along to next people

203
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
without

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
that huge wealth of experience

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
so

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
it really kind of started begging that

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
question to me what's the secret sauce

208
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,080
how do we build this how do i drive them

209
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
into teams

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,878
so around this time

211
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,639
sorry

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
technical glitch

213
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
around this time

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
also had the opportunity at a different

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,479
conference

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,280
to listen to a leader a literally uh

217
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
individual that was part of the team

218
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
that wrote the book on incident response

219
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,759
and their conversation on stage at this

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
this conference and i think

221
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,800
they were

222
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
thinking about business use cases and

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
not so much thinking

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
expansively about the response but they

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
half-jokingly said they measured success

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
by the number of analysts that were

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
sleeping on data center floors

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
now i was a leader in this company as a

229
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
manager in this company and i was

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
thinking about the fact that if i had my

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
people sleeping on data center floors

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
overnight that this is in some ways a

233
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
reflection on me and a reflection of

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
failure on my part now i know this

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
individual is probably joking and i mean

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
this is an individual that's often

237
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
rolled up their sleeves and really you

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
know committed to doing the work but at

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,760
a point i started thinking about about

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
the culture in the environment that i

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
was working in and all the different

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
things uh that were there so

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
um

244
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
that comment

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
was meant to be funny

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,480
in some ways

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
but it for me started me thinking down

248
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,880
this path

249
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
of

250
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
what does the culture look like that

251
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
says it's acceptable for someone to be

252
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
sleeping on a data center for now i

253
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
think you know anybody has anybody done

254
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
that has anybody worked overnight

255
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,720
on a project not walked away

256
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,959
so more than a couple of nights

257
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
so giving up weekends

258
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
etc

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
so did you feel that that was part of

260
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,519
success in that role

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,600
yeah so i had the same conclusion

262
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,760
success in this role is me giving up all

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,279
of these other things in order to be

264
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,560
successful

265
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,839
in this role and i started thinking

266
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
about where does that come from

267
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
where does that where does that drive

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
come from and more so where is that

269
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,800
being reinforced from

270
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
so i started kind of noodling on that

271
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
and that's where this part of this talk

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,000
comes from

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
so

274
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
we're going to be talking about hero

275
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
culture and i want to make some some

276
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
clear distinctions here i'm not talking

277
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
about heroism

278
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
okay

279
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
did everybody see sophie's talk earlier

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
today did anybody miss that so if you

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
haven't seen it

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,000
phenomenal talk i encourage you to go

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
back and look look at that talk and

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
listen to it because there's a lot of

285
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
really great stuff there that's heroic

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
action that's heroism in my mind you may

287
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
disagree with me but

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,320
there is a necessity for heroism and

289
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,519
that's not what we're talking about

290
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,120
we're going to be talking about the

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
culture heroic culture not heroic action

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
when

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
the culture itself becomes standard

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
operating procedure and necessitates

295
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
heroic action over and over and over

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,519
again

297
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
okay there certainly is a role for

298
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
heroism there certainly is a

299
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,000
opposition there certainly is evil in

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
the world

301
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
that we are more than aware of

302
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
right

303
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
so there's a need for that kind of thing

304
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
but as a culture

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
working within this industry

306
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
so i think oftentimes we've adopted this

307
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,760
culture without really questioning why

308
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
so for example um and again i'm going to

309
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
apologize and i i

310
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,720
apologize in advance i'm going to poke a

311
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,920
couple of bears

312
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
this evening

313
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
i am not singling anybody out i don't

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
want to step on anybody's work but since

315
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
we live in

316
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,279
social media since we live in spaces

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
together i've done a little archaeology

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
a little anthropology and pulled some of

319
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,600
these together as examples

320
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,160
so i'm going to ask you to take these

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
just as references but not use these to

322
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,639
action anything in particular not stop

323
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
using people not stop using vendors

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
but

325
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,639
so just some examples this is just a

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,560
real quick example of some of the

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,880
advertising some of the media for not

328
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
only um

329
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,600
consumer consumer programs or different

330
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,519
enterprises or training courses or

331
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
um professional development

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
within here so

333
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
does hero culture lend itself

334
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
to our industry absolutely when we think

335
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
hero culture we think late nights we

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,519
think

337
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,959
insane development what do we think

338
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,120
about what what type of

339
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,279
development cycle are we looking at

340
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
we're talking about startups right we're

341
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
talking about that that in a garage

342
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,959
moment

343
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,760
so

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
long hours

345
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
lots of effort et cetera so of course it

346
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
lends itself to it and marketing has

347
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
done a great job and we've embraced some

348
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
of that in a lot of ways

349
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
so i kind of want to do like a just a

350
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,959
real quick pulse and tell me if any of

351
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,399
these resonate for you so who here has

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,480
unlimited time off through their their

353
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
organization through their professional

354
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,200
organization

355
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
through pto just show of hands

356
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
okay we've got a couple

357
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,040
how many of these phrases have you heard

358
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
in the last week or two in your

359
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
organization working around the clock

360
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
so and so went above and beyond

361
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
uh last minute firefighting we have a

362
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
crisis blah blah blah

363
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
so how many of you work for

364
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,600
organizations that when they recognize

365
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
and bonus people that these are the type

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
of things that you see called out in

367
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
those bonus structures

368
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
this team worked all weekend on this

369
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
project to get this in under the wire

370
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,279
quest good awesome so

371
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,160
um

372
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,519
how many of you think of that as a

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
management failure

374
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
absolutely

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
excellent so we're on the same page so

376
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
these are the sort of things that i

377
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
started hearing and i started seeing in

378
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,839
lots of these bonus structures and lots

379
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
of reviews

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
lots of uh nine box lots of different

381
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,720
ways that we evaluate our teams in who's

382
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
willing to go the extra mile

383
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
not just doing the job

384
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
so we're going to play a little game

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
we're going to call it spot the

386
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
superhero and here i'm going to tie back

387
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,079
into

388
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,040
kind of the superhero imagery

389
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,199
that we're used to right

390
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,360
so what do superheroes have typically

391
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,040
extraordinary powers

392
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
so in some cases maybe they worked hard

393
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
to get them maybe they fell into a vat

394
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
maybe they got bit by a spider maybe

395
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,440
they were born with them and shot

396
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,519
in a satellite from another planet

397
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
etcetera but typically extraordinary

398
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
powers that go what above and beyond

399
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
almost everybody else

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
so what do they use those powers for

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
well they get done

402
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,000
right

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
so often unapologetically they just are

404
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
taking action there's definitely a bias

405
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,079
to action they're not sitting there

406
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,600
waiting for things they don't have to do

407
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
a whole lot of evaluation of what their

408
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
impacts are they just go and get

409
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
done

410
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,160
often cases they have limited

411
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
vulnerability which is to say you can

412
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
only take them out with what

413
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
kryptonite silver silver bullet

414
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,480
water

415
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,680
stuff like that

416
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
so limited vulnerability we'll get into

417
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
why that's a problem they're often

418
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
bigger than life when i say bigger than

419
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
life they're often bigger than life

420
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,600
personalities

421
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
they're often personalities that in

422
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
other places would stand out so much

423
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
that you can't possibly turn away from

424
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
that person

425
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
so they're often worshiped and adored

426
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
they're often elevated above everybody

427
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,920
else there are statues created for them

428
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
so they're often masked they often

429
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
operate in obscurity we don't get to see

430
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
their other identity within there they

431
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
operate in a secret lair

432
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,959
so they don't go into an office

433
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
typically as their

434
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
hero self

435
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
right and there's often a traumatic

436
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,480
origin story there's often something

437
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
that is compelling them and driving them

438
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,040
now

439
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,720
extraordinary powers there's also

440
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
different rules

441
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,440
so if if again let's think about any of

442
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
the cinematic universes that you

443
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
choose to exist in

444
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
think about if you went and tore down

445
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
buildings trying to take out a bad

446
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
person taking out evil

447
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,759
so this is not the sort of thing that

448
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,160
would typically be acceptable right

449
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
so there's typically a lack of

450
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
accountability why because you're

451
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,279
getting done somebody had to do it

452
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,160
right

453
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
the ben the the benefit of their action

454
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
typically outweighs the means to them

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
doing the action

456
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
with limited vulnerability there's

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
limited risk there's no need for risk

458
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
evaluation some of these superheroes

459
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
don't think about oh my god what happens

460
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
if i don't come home from work

461
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,480
they just walk in

462
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
that bigger than life personality can

463
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,920
also in some cases be a toxic

464
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
personality

465
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,639
so

466
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,279
that worshiped adored mindset often we

467
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,279
idealize the behavior of these people

468
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,079
and we do what we ignore some of the

469
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
things that they do that we may not

470
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
agree with again because

471
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
they get done

472
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
think about the amount of time

473
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,839
that

474
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,399
superheroes and again we're talking

475
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,919
spend on their secret identity

476
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
and their true identity what i'm saying

477
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,799
is the for example uh mild matter

478
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,359
reporter

479
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,240
world beater

480
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,119
okay

481
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,799
costume is mild-mannered reporter

482
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,359
haircut and glasses

483
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,400
right

484
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
not the cape and boots and the whole bit

485
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
so secret layer isolated from the

486
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,039
community where do they operate they

487
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
typically operate on an edge

488
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
so shadow i.t to the nth degree

489
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
and that traumatic origin story often

490
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
helps us exclude them from the norms we

491
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
forgive them

492
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
in lots of ways

493
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,840
so why is this a

494
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,440
problem well first off

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
who wouldn't want to be a hero

496
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
so it's kind of great you get to do

497
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,200
pretty much whatever you want whenever

498
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,679
you want to to whomever you want without

499
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
any kind of accountability and you get

500
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
praised for it

501
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
so what happens with that praise

502
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
who doesn't like praise raise your hand

503
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
who doesn't like recognition anybody

504
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
so it's no accident and this is where we

505
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
get into the social media piece of this

506
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,919
so um it's no accident that as human

507
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
beings we enjoy praise

508
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,240
so anybody familiar with uh

509
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,720
the olds and milner experience

510
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
with rats

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
so old milner did an experiment somewhat

512
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,799
controversial now where they wired rats

513
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,360
pleasure centers and put a lever in a

514
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
box

515
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,559
okay where the rat had the opportunity

516
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
to hit the lever

517
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,120
for its pleasure center or to get food

518
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
and sleep and drink anybody want to

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
guess what happened to the rats for a

520
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
coin

521
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
there you go

522
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
exactly they kept pressing the button

523
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,679
until they killed themselves that

524
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,919
pleasure center believe it or not as

525
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,000
social animals as human beings we do a

526
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
lot of the same that heroic action that

527
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,400
heroic response that cultural elevation

528
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
in many ways lights up the same centers

529
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,000
of our brain as those pleasure centers

530
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
so who wouldn't want to be a hero

531
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
so

532
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
we're going to dig in a little bit and i

533
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,720
want to break these down into a couple

534
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,919
of things and really i'm going to try to

535
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,520
get you to think about some of this and

536
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
then i'm going to give you hopefully

537
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
some strategies that are going to work

538
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
to help us move beyond this

539
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
so so first

540
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
essentially heroes need villains

541
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,200
so here's the trick question here's the

542
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,160
trap

543
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
you ready for it

544
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,918
who's the villain

545
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
management

546
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,080
good so point for that gentleman yeah

547
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
most cases you'd think

548
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,600
it's apt it's fin groups it's it's evil

549
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
but it's not it's management it's our

550
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
users

551
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
the people that we are we are

552
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,280
asked to protect and to educate and

553
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,120
defend

554
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
are the people that actually become the

555
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
villains for our arguments and our

556
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
conversations we set ourselves against

557
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
them and by doing so

558
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,159
we isolate ourselves we set ourselves

559
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
apart in fact

560
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
i'll ask you to be honest here who

561
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,840
thinks you're smarter than the people

562
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,720
that you work for

563
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,039
here you go well done so in many cases

564
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,480
i'm not saying intellectually maybe

565
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
we're not maybe we are

566
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
but we separate ourselves from the

567
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,919
essential business processes

568
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
so what do we do become

569
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,960
people that

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
don't typically get invited to the table

571
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
unless it's a really uncomfortable

572
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,480
moment we separate ourselves from the

573
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
people that we need to work with that we

574
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
actually are trying to drive positive

575
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,559
change for

576
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,559
so

577
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,440
it not only makes us makes us in some

578
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
ways feel superior again think of the

579
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
rats in the lever

580
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,640
okay but it belittles those that we're

581
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
protecting

582
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
and does what

583
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
drives a degree of resentment for them

584
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
further causing us to separate ourselves

585
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,240
to crawl back into our layers

586
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,199
and it's pretty pervasive

587
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
which takes us to

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
we crawl back into our layers and we do

589
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
what we build silos

590
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
what i'm talking about silos i'm talking

591
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
about knowledge silos i'm talking about

592
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,880
control silos in order to maintain

593
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,159
our

594
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,200
superior superiority our elevation our

595
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
different part we build silos of

596
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
knowledge we build silos of control of

597
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
these systems we don't let that control

598
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
go now look this is really easy in

599
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
security because essentially we do have

600
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
to protect people from themselves and we

601
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
do have to protect these systems but in

602
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
a lot of cases we do it

603
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
almost unconsciously

604
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
so here's the question how many of you

605
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
have ever struggled with documentation

606
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,840
after an incident

607
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
how many of you have picked up after

608
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
somebody else has done work and said

609
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
what the hell happened here it's like oh

610
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
i got it all up here

611
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
there you go so we build silos we

612
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,400
separate ourselves and we convince

613
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
ourselves

614
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
that we're the only ones that can do a

615
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,039
job

616
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
when in fact what are we doing we're

617
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
making it impossible for anybody else to

618
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
do our job to help us

619
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,039
and again build that resentment

620
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
which then helps us mask deeper problems

621
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,919
and what are we talking about here

622
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,720
so

623
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,679
we get the recognition

624
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
for diving in at the last minute

625
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,320
solving the crisis

626
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,039
putting out fires okay i'd like you to

627
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
think about something so we'll take that

628
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
that same caped superhero from another

629
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
planet

630
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
so i'm trying to avoid anybody suing me

631
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
here um that superhero from another

632
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
planet well imagine you live in a city

633
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
where that superhero is working all the

634
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
time

635
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
how much budget do you think the fire

636
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
department gets in that city

637
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
what's your expectation when your

638
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
building catches fire oh xyz will come

639
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
in and save me not the fire department

640
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
what happens when that person

641
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
that superhero stops responding

642
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,360
people die

643
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
things get broken

644
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
we spend our time in many cases going

645
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,799
crisis to crisis to crisis

646
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
and we convince ourselves that the

647
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
essential reason that happens is we are

648
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,600
handling crises we're dealing with

649
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
software we're dealing with zero days

650
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
we're dealing with breaches and and

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,159
complexity

652
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,520
when really what we're doing is we're

653
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
not spending time

654
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
solving for those problems that we know

655
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
is there we talk about ransomware a lot

656
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
lately and what are most of the fixes

657
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
for ransomware basic blocking and

658
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
tackling things we've been talking about

659
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,440
for years

660
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
so have we been effective at driving

661
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
that change no why because in one case

662
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
we dive in and we save the day which is

663
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
somewhat self-serving

664
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
and then say well we can't do all the

665
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,640
basic stuff we can't do network

666
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
segmentation we can't do patching and

667
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
updating and that kind of stuff

668
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
because we're busy saving the day

669
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,840
we build this

670
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,279
self-replicating defeating system for

671
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
our organizations

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,919
all right with me so far

673
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,000
okay here's the really scary and nasty

674
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,360
stuff that's this kind of the systematic

675
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,240
systemic problems that we're seeing this

676
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
is the stuff that really kind of bugs me

677
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,039
not everybody can be a hero

678
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
so just show of hands who's new to

679
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
information security who's like less

680
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,159

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,679
these five pages

697
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,840
in detail still wanting to answer the

698
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,000
question

699
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,279
excellent

700
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,039

thank you ward

702
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
excellent i'm not actually going to ask

703
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,720
you the question but i'm going to tell

704
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,559
you what the question would be how many

705
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
people got asked what happens when you

706
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
google

707
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
anybody

708
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
familiar with this

709
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,640
excellent did everybody feel comfortable

710
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
in their answer

711
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
excellent here's an interesting thing

712
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,559
and i'm going to posit this and a lot of

713
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,760
people use this question and there's a

714
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
lot of debate on and there are a couple

715
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
of threats

716
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,279
for me the only real positive answer to

717
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,559
that is how much detail do you want

718
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,559
but really what am i asking when i'm

719
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,000
asking

720
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
what happens when you google so i'm not

721
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,240
asking what you know i'm asking you to

722
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
tell me

723
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,720
what you think i know

724
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,200
i'm looking for you to pair it back to

725
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
me an answer that i find acceptable

726
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
because look you may know you know from

727
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,400
pressing the key electrical signal back

728
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,159
to the motherboard back to the you may

729
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,760
have it at that level of detail but

730
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
unless i hear what i want to hear what i

731
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
expect to hear from that do you think

732
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,760
you're getting the job

733
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
so for my

734
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,400
way of thinking

735
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,159
that kind of open-ended broad question

736
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
doesn't really help you understand

737
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
someone's technical ability or their

738
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,600
potential success in a job

739
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
thank you for volunteering

740
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
so i know that can be scary okay so

741
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,159
for this can you guys see this

742
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,640
pretty clearly i hope

743
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,679
not really

744
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,200
all right you may have to squint i

745
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
apologize and i forgot my magnifier

746
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
all right so for those of you that can

747
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,720
see this okay i want you to think in

748
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,840
your heads

749
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,279
what level

750
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,880
of a position

751
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,120
is this posting for or i'm sorry this

752
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,279
these questions would pertain to and i'm

753
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,120
going to come back

754
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
how about this a little bit easier to

755
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
read

756
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
anybody want to tell me like

757
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
organizationally l3

758
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
senior manager

759
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,559
director

760
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,039
ic what level this is looking for

761
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,159
entry level really you think so

762
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,039
really everybody agree with entry level

763
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
all of these

764
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,399
defined cryptography

765
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,919
okay

766
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
i was a little shocked so these are

767
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
questions for an internship

768
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,640
now i read that and i feel that's free

769
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
work and if this is what we're

770
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
accustomed to as entry level now i think

771
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,039
what

772
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
you know

773
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,000
all right

774
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
but i'll let you read through this

775
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,480
so i think having a good technical

776
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
background i think having a great

777
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
understanding of some of the basics is

778
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
probably really solid but for an

779
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,399
internship my understanding of

780
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,679
internship is

781
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,799
you're coming to me coming to us for us

782
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,039
to kind of teach you how things work

783
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,840
now we've got to have a place to start

784
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
but some of the questions on there are a

785
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
little bit more advanced

786
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,000
so

787
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
this guy is looking for

788
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
candidates with master's degrees

789
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
there are three million empty seats

790
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
according to pontimon

791
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,679
you think we're doing a little

792
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
gatekeeping maybe

793
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
how about this

794
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,919
also an internship job

795
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
get system in cobalt strike okay now

796
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,279
what not it not the worst question but

797
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,600
look at the depth of answer

798
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
pipes impersonation tokens a lot of

799
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
removing principles escalation is this a

800
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
45 minute one hour two hour six hour

801
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,799
interview

802
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
at an internal level

803
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
so as we start cutting our teeth on this

804
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
i'm asking myself i'm like why is it

805
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,159
hard to get people why is it hard to

806
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,120
fill those three million empty chairs

807
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
where do we gather that experience how

808
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
do we start bringing more people into

809
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,559
this

810
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,559
into this fight into this this

811
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,200
profession so and i look at it and i go

812
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,360
okay even coming out compsci

813
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,039
doesn't make you as me

814
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
so you're coming out with a degree

815
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
maybe you can answer those questions

816
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,520
maybe you can't but that doesn't make

817
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,320
you a subject matter expert well i mean

818
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
seems a little defeatist to me

819
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,399
so limiting value without a solid i.t

820
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
background

821
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
infosec not an entry-level field

822
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
now look i've worked in a lot of

823
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,640
different roles in a lot of different

824
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
industries i've worked in a lot of

825
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
kitchens i've prepared food for

826
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
thousands and thousands of people

827
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,399
so there's an entry level role that you

828
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,960
can get to that builds you up for all

829
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
those levels

830
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
many roles you can come into and know

831
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
very little and have what just a desire

832
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,840
to learn what are we doing we're setting

833
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
this bar this high

834
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
this high

835
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,799
by the time some people get through

836
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,559
those interviews they're probably not

837
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,000
interested anymore because what are we

838
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
doing we're icing them out we're gate

839
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
keeping and in a lot of cases we're

840
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,240
gatekeeping in ways

841
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,360
that

842
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,158
is pretty uh

843
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,880
pretty terrible for anybody that's not

844
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,240
coming from the same kind of backgrounds

845
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,600
that we're coming for we'll talk a

846
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,760
little bit about that in a second

847
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,480
so

848
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,279
or

849
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,440
we're isolating people that are

850
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
you got to really be into it maybe

851
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,919
you're not just looking for the money

852
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,240
i'm sorry does anybody work for not the

853
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
money i know it's not always about the

854
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,840
money i'm pretty mission oriented myself

855
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,399
but money is kind of necessary for

856
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,520
adults

857
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,679
right

858
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
so even if you get the job even if you

859
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,240
get a role

860
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
so

861
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
suck it up if it's a toxic environment

862
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,559
yeah it's going to be terrible you're

863
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,760
going to hate it you're gonna burn it

864
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,120
out you're gonna you're just gonna hate

865
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320
your life but you know what suck it up

866
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,159
to get the experience so you can move on

867
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,279
and this is the kind of advice that

868
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,640
we're giving people coming into the

869
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,880
field

870
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,919
so this one

871
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,159
this one kind of bugs me and i'm going

872
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,000
to call it out and i apologize to the

873
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,519
individual that's called out in this

874
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
particular uh hot take if you will

875
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,919
but i wanted to kind of use it to

876
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
illustrate a point um

877
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,559
does anybody know what

878
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,399
peter zachko studied in college is

879
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
peter's echo in the room

880
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,240
peter is not a friend of mine although i

881
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,159
admire peter

882
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,519
anybody tell me what peter studied in

883
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
college

884
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,120
peter

885
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
sorry did he drop out no didn't uh peter

886
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,000
went on to

887
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,120
work with loft and cult of the dead cow

888
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,799
and darpa

889
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,720
so some pretty slacker

890
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
non-stellar organizations peter is

891
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,960
better known as mudge

892
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,120
peter was a music major at the berkeley

893
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,840
college of music

894
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,080
so

895
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,399
um

896
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,399
thinking about this that anybody

897
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,799
familiar with the and forgive me if

898
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,440
you've learned different pronunciation

899
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,519
there is a

900
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,600
tendency when we interview when we try

901
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
to look at people called

902
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
homophily

903
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,799
basically we're looking and interviewing

904
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,640
for someone that looks sounds a lot like

905
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,360
us we're looking for that validation

906
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
for that individual

907
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,159
there were a lot of studies that were

908
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
done post 911 both in the fbi and the

909
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,919
cia that identified a lot of what got in

910
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,840
their way of being responsive

911
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,279
organizations that maybe could have had

912
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,120
different impacts on some of the things

913
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
that we're seeing some of the crime that

914
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,600
we're seeing

915
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,039
if they had expanded beyond that hiring

916
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,559
the same person over and over again

917
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,519
basically looking in the mirror and

918
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,279
trying to hire that same person and this

919
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,799
really speaks to

920
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,440
in lots of ways

921
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,360
the lack of diversity the lack of

922
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,799
diversity of thought the lack of

923
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,840
shall we say gatekeeping and lack of

924
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,440
appreciation for people trying to come

925
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
into the field

926
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,679
so heroes undermine teams

927
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,519
so and i'm going to try to be cognizant

928
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,120
of time so we got some time

929
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
for questions

930
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,000
who here has worked with a brilliant

931
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
jerk

932
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,120
who's

933
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,039
excellent so how did you how did they

934
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
make you feel

935
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,000
everybody know what i mean when i say

936
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,760
brilliant jerk

937
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
excellent how did they make you feel did

938
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
you enjoy working with them

939
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,159
so what was their general impact on any

940
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,840
project they were working on

941
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,919
yeah they take credit for everything and

942
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,600
what do they do to the rest of the team

943
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,879
ignore them

944
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,120
yeah turn into a martyr they tear down

945
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
teams brilliant jerks so in a lot of

946
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,159
cases um who who who are some of these

947
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,399
people

948
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,640
there you go they become

949
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
they become these icons

950
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,120
again think back to the traits of the

951
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,480
superhero they become these icons that

952
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,960
eventually have to rely on who they rely

953
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
on teams to accomplish their goals and

954
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,120
then basically piss all over their teams

955
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
take the credit

956
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
demoralize their teams and kind of move

957
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
on there's something there though when

958
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
you think about they need teams in order

959
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,239
to accomplish accomplish to grow right

960
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,359
but

961
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,960
they don't work well with teams and

962
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
we've done a great job of protecting

963
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
these individuals in our in information

964
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
security in fact a lot of times we laud

965
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
them and people are just like uh that's

966
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
fine they're okay

967
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:28,719
so

968
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,440
the more that we embrace that the more

969
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
that we allow that to happen so i think

970
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,359
we've probably all worked with somebody

971
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,399
that's like hey i can't put them in

972
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,918
front of customers or no please don't

973
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,760
invite them to this meeting or certainly

974
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
don't let them sit down with the c-suite

975
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,399
or the board

976
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,000
right but they're brilliant we build

977
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,159
around them they're essential they have

978
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,199
knowledge that only that only they have

979
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
they have a problem that only they can

980
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,199
fix

981
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,040
so this is pretty recent so pardon if

982
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,599
this smarts for anybody so they put

983
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,760
themselves what further apart and

984
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,480
further above even us so even within

985
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
information even within the community we

986
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
see these brilliant jerks these people

987
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,839
elevating themselves well above

988
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
even us

989
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,160
so we're going to talk about

990
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,640
the natural extension to the brilliant

991
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,920
jerk and we're going to talk about

992
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,720
really bad behavior and and

993
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,800
this is kind of a razor's edge here so

994
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
regardless of how you feel about some of

995
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,920
these incidents and i think you're

996
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,599
probably maybe tuning into what i'm

997
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,320
talking about some highly

998
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
public some

999
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
incidents that have happened in the last

1000
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,359
couple of years where people have acted

1001
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,839
out in very very bad

1002
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,119
criminal

1003
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,200
type of ways

1004
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,440
hero culture makes it very hard to

1005
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,520
identify someone and then hold them

1006
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
accountable and call them to task for

1007
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,359
what they've done

1008
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,240
okay this is when we have

1009
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
predators among us that are look

1010
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,480
everybody knows this person's doing bad

1011
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
but nobody wants to say anything because

1012
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
they wrote a couple of really good books

1013
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,599
and they've done a lot for the community

1014
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
they've done a lot for charities they've

1015
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,760
done a lot for whatever

1016
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,920
okay people that exceed our even our

1017
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
personal code of conduct

1018
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,200
so

1019
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
this is really kind of uh

1020
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,320
problematic because it's very hard to

1021
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,359
then attack that person because

1022
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,960
we raise them up they're statues to

1023
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,359
these individuals what's worse is they

1024
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,359
take that in many cases they can take

1025
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,680
that status and do what create new

1026
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,359
victims

1027
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,440
and this becomes what this is acceptable

1028
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,520
behavior within the community so i'm not

1029
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,560
going to dive in and i'm not going to

1030
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,720
give you any examples of that

1031
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,560
but i wanted to kind of tee it up and i

1032
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,960
thought we had to mention it because

1033
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,599
hero culture in organizations makes it

1034
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,240
very very very hard

1035
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,920
for us to hold these people accountable

1036
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,480
and do anything with them and and really

1037
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,359
you know

1038
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,040
make them

1039
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
either aware of what they're doing

1040
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,880
taking care of the victims of those

1041
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,400
behaviors

1042
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
and sets us

1043
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
sets us in a bad state

1044
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
we're going to talk about other bad

1045
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,000
behaviors and this is not kind of

1046
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
criminal behavior this is not really

1047
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,400
hurting people in a lot of cases uh this

1048
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
is hurting ourselves

1049
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
everybody's familiar with this

1050
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
so how much sleep

1051
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
how much sleep did everybody got last

1052
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
night

1053
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,320
anybody get eight hours

1054
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
not a lot

1055
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,400
so

1056
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,320
so does anybody on your teams in slack

1057
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
or or discord any other chat like talk

1058
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,720
about the little bit of sleep that you

1059
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,040
get the little bit of rest that you get

1060
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
so anybody not think that sleep's

1061
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
essential

1062
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,320
what about uh you know all-night ctfs

1063
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,640
no sleep until i get this understanding

1064
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
we're constantly driving ourselves the

1065
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
expectation that's set i do this myself

1066
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,040
i'm really bad with us we're working all

1067
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
the time

1068
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,880
all the time

1069
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
what kind of spare time do you have how

1070
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
do you take care of your mental health

1071
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,079
what do you do to get away from this we

1072
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,680
work in exceptionally high pressure

1073
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,440
situations what do we do

1074
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
so

1075
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,359
we're irreplaceable i can't take time

1076
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,720
off i can't take

1077
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
time off

1078
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
so back to the uto question uto is a

1079
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,599
trap

1080
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,119
so companies know that we're not going

1081
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,400
to take the time

1082
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,760
so we're just going to keep working

1083
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
beyond that so we don't rest we don't

1084
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,839
take time off we don't do things that

1085
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,880
are good for our mental health what do

1086
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,240
we do

1087
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,160
we drink

1088
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,359
we imbibe we work hard we play hard we

1089
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,960
play harder

1090
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,680
so this constant glorification of i just

1091
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,440
need to numb myself i need to unplug

1092
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,280
myself and we accept this and we

1093
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,160
encourage this in lots of ways so there

1094
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,599
are still talks and i think most of them

1095
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,640
gotten beyond this but there's still

1096
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
talks that if it's your first talk you

1097
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
do what when you give the talk

1098
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,359
you got to do a shot

1099
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
so now there is the reality that hey

1100
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
when something happens we've got to come

1101
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,359
in but

1102
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,040
with hero culture as soon as somebody

1103
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
sees something in the news

1104
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,160
my cfo sees something in the news and

1105
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,400
goes what's this log4j thing everybody's

1106
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
got to come in and work all weekend

1107
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
we create this mythology

1108
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,640
that sometimes is real but most of the

1109
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
time is

1110
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,359
so that we've got to come in we've got

1111
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,800
to be essential we've got to get called

1112
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,079
we've got to rally around these

1113
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,480
community community production events

1114
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,599
and we reinforce this for ourselves

1115
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,680
as this is how you make your bones this

1116
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
is how you gain experience

1117
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,440
these are the stories that we we tell

1118
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,280
each other when we get together and

1119
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
drink

1120
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,960
so which leads to burnout

1121
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
so

1122
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,640
moving right along sorry

1123
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,440
so

1124
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,119
i just want to juxtapose these two

1125
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,480
surveys that were done

1126
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,560
before pandemic surveys that were done

1127
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,599
after

1128
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,520
balance of power towards threat actors i

1129
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
mean that's pretty understandable

1130
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,680
so most organizations

1131
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
most people feel and this is a mon i'm

1132
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
sorry threat connect

1133
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
survey

1134
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
most organizations fall behind in

1135
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
providing training so you've got to kind

1136
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
of do it on your own which means less

1137
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,119
sleep

1138
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,640
very few people feel they've got a

1139
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,319
defined career path

1140
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,839
and

1141
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,680
high pressure environment causes burnout

1142
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,280
that's in 2018.

1143
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,720
so fast forward 2022

1144
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,800
out of the the survey group

1145
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,119
depression anger anger anxiety not

1146
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,960
enough talent on teams can't find enough

1147
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
professionals

1148
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,359
increased staff turnover 67 increased

1149
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,400
staff over um turnover and most people

1150
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,760
feel like they're doing well a

1151
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,880
percentage of people feel like they're

1152
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,319
doing work of three

1153
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,720
32 and i saw a stat yesterday that said

1154
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,760
this is actually 41. uh consider people

1155
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,960
are considering changing jobs in the

1156
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
next six months

1157
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,920
that's a

1158
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
insane

1159
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,920
amount of turnover

1160
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
anybody experiencing any of these on any

1161
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,839
regular basis

1162
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,880
headaches fatigue sleeping difficult

1163
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
difficulties eye depression muscular

1164
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,079
tension

1165
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,280
feel like you're not being able to

1166
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,640
perform terribly well feeling

1167
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,480
overwhelmed and unable to cope

1168
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,720
you are not alone

1169
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,040
okay so why

1170
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
well

1171
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,480
what makes working the sock painful

1172
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
we're going to expand sock to think

1173
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,680
about security practice

1174
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,839
increased workload well that's ticking

1175
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
up this is a panaman survey from 2019

1176
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
and 2020. increased workload being on

1177
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,400
call 24 7 information overload too many

1178
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,359
risks

1179
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,599
we've got to work all the way down to 10

1180
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
before we even talk about

1181
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
the enemy

1182
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,319
here

1183
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,960
anybody look at that list and tell me

1184
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
what those top nine things

1185
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
have in common in lots of ways and who's

1186
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,079
got control over them

1187
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
anybody

1188
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,839
these are all manageable these are all

1189
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,040
things that

1190
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
leadership probably has a way of

1191
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,400
defending

1192
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,200
a way of addressing being on call 24 7

1193
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,640
if we really wanted to shift that

1194
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,880
correctly too many alerts

1195
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
lack of visibility these are all things

1196
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,160
these are all management failures as

1197
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,079
well

1198
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,079
so

1199
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
heroes need villains they build silos

1200
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,040
create exclusion

1201
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,359
mass deeper problems disempower

1202
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,400
and eventually burn out

1203
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,760
don't fear

1204
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
there is hope no pun well fun absolutely

1205
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
intended what can you do all right so

1206
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
this is real short and i'm going to have

1207
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,839
more resources and links that are out on

1208
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,079
my linkedin and across and twitter

1209
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,240
because this is kind of ongoing for me

1210
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
understanding your culture and

1211
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
work in the community so look about it

1212
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,160
off hoping that if you walk out of here

1213
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,760
with nothing else you at least look at

1214
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,520
some of the things that you see going on

1215
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,640
around you

1216
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,520
and think about how the culture is

1217
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,599
driving some of those

1218
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,520
i encourage you to update recruiting and

1219
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,480
hiring

1220
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,280
um to be a little less one

1221
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,880
confrontational

1222
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,520
it should not be a contest back and

1223
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,760
forth between you if you're interviewing

1224
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,520
and the applicant or the applicant back

1225
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,440
and forth so get to know each other you

1226
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,520
eventually have to work together and in

1227
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
a lot of ways the skills that are going

1228
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
to make a difference beyond the

1229
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,880
technical skills of course we're

1230
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,160
technical industry of course the

1231
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
technical skills are in a matter but the

1232
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
more that we move towards being an

1233
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,720
identified business process

1234
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,240
the technical skills one aren't going to

1235
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
get you there so maybe hire somebody

1236
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
that's got curiosity and integrity that

1237
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,920
you can teach the technical skills to

1238
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,680
transform heroic behavior into

1239
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,319
transformational opportunity after every

1240
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,160
time we burn something to the ground

1241
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
every after every crisis

1242
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
use that and don't let the crisis end

1243
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,200
until we've improved systems

1244
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,960
until we've looked at processes and said

1245
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,280
why was it necessary for my entire team

1246
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,880
to work all weekend on this

1247
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
so eliminate or educate or eliminate

1248
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,720
brilliant jerks take them aside i'm a

1249
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,800
big fan of radical candor if anybody's

1250
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
read the kim scott

1251
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,520
try to educate and move people along

1252
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,680
build collaborative diverse and healthy

1253
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,880
teams i believe that this alone can move

1254
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,280
the culture forward teams where you do

1255
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,599
not have one

1256
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,880
single

1257
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,319
thought process

1258
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,400
thought background a diversity of

1259
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,240
thought people where there's a little

1260
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
bit of

1261
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,520
creative conflict that you can

1262
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
effectively manage and leverage to come

1263
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
up with better answers i will tell you

1264
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,960
that the adversary is doing this

1265
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,800
okay if you've got everybody that's

1266
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,560
coming from the same background from the

1267
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,119
same training the same mindset the same

1268
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,359
certifications there's a gap in your

1269
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,599
process if i'm the adversary i'm gonna

1270
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,720
find it

1271
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,880
pretty quickly based

1272
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,520
just on who's in your organization

1273
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,640
so build social capital for everybody

1274
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,839
okay don't just allow heroes to rise

1275
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,920
rise everybody you do speaking

1276
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,280
engagements et cetera bring your whole

1277
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,960
team along

1278
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,079
implement

1279
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,839
diversity inclusion as a requirement

1280
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,920
in your hiring practices not just for

1281
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
its sake but make it a key indicator

1282
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,760
update recognition awards stop

1283
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,240
recognizing people for working

1284
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,440
crazy hours in crazy sprints

1285
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,319
so recognize things like collaboration

1286
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,960
innovation

1287
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,359
um an act in the community um there's

1288
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,720
two things and i've got a couple of

1289
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,359
books here um one insist on code of

1290
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,720
conducts

1291
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,240
for organizations

1292
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,599
for conferences for places you go

1293
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,359
so and

1294
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,520
train yourself up i'm a big fan of

1295
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,760
bystander intervention anybody

1296
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,680
previously work with hollaback or

1297
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,720
bystander intervention the 5ds

1298
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,800
okay outstanding in a lot of cases

1299
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,319
people are

1300
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,839
unsure of what they can do in a

1301
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,960
situation and this is in the the real

1302
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,680
world and digitally so how you can enter

1303
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,720
the space

1304
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,160
um

1305
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,200
links on my linkedin to the 5ds

1306
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,440
phenomenal stuff and i've got a great

1307
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,680
book by shauna potter on making spaces

1308
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,119
safer

1309
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,160
there are resources that will be

1310
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,280
available

1311
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,560
and with that any questions

1312
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,640
no questions ah where are you

1313
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,799
hit me

1314
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,119
can't build a team within it that's a

1315
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,680
great question um

1316
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,520
we we almost have to take it back and

1317
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,560
this is one of the reasons that i like

1318
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,079
the kind of the nexus of customer

1319
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,560
success and security space

1320
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,480
um understanding what drives and what

1321
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,760
those without motivators are so outline

1322
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,599
for them they're typically that's a cost

1323
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,119
cutting riffing people as a cost cutting

1324
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
measure show them what the real costs

1325
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,960
are how long does it take to train

1326
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,720
to find retain hire people show them in

1327
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,560
dollar value what the impact of not

1328
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
having this team is there

1329
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,040
okay including things like look if we

1330
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,800
cut this i'm going to lose half of my

1331
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,160
team in the next six months because

1332
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,359
they're going to go work somewhere where

1333
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,880
they're not getting buried and that's

1334
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,520
going to cost you x

1335
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,280
you know understand what their

1336
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,599
measurement is how they view the world

1337
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,000
understand their objectives

1338
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,240
and then start framing

1339
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,319
framing your answers and your arguments

1340
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,480
and the language that they're using

1341
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,960
so great question so i we can get into

1342
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,079
that a little bit more there's some

1343
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,440
there's some really good strategies on

1344
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,760
that um

1345
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,400
anybody else

1346
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,280
outstanding appreciate it thank you so

1347
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,160
much

1348
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,359
have a great night enjoy the rest of

1349
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,520
hope

1350
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,839
all right thank you for the talk and
