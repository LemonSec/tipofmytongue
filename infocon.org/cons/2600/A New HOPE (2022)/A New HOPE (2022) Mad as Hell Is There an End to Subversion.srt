that was a fast intro uh and by the way

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
this animated gif here is a summary of

20
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,720
my talk

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
so

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
so let's let's look at it one more time

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
in all the gift glory it has

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
and yeah so there we go

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
so uh hello to a new hope

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
yay

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
there's a [ __ ] umlaut in it yes

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
excellent and by the way that's the

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
cross downstairs they put a googly eye

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
on it yesterday so

31
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
i enjoyed a subversion

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
it they removed it again of course and i

33
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,200
think there has to be more googly eye

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
stuff on it by the way it is a very

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
catholic school and it looks so

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
protestant like i'm a good old catholic

37
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,200
atheist

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
and i do not approve of the

39
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,159
the non-garishness of this catholic

40
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
facility okay anyhow so my name is

41
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,920
johannes uh i'm part of an art uh and

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
theory and film collective called

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,519
monochrome uh i'm mad as hell uh let's

44
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
talk about that later uh and it is

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
actually the second part of a talk i

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,680
gave it hope in

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,200
2000 2006

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
which is a long time ago so some of you

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
weren't even born yet

50
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,200
good for you

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
so why revisit a talk i gave in 2006

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
because here's the hill i'm gonna die on

53
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,080
that's why

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
it's one of my it's one of my pet

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
projects subversion um i am from austria

56
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
that's how austria looks like uh austria

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
has has many hills and lots of mass

58
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,400
murder and stuff like that but i don't

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
want to talk about that today uh but uh

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
i want to talk about subversion and

61
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,959
there's a lot of

62
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
face palming and double face palming uh

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
if you think about counterculture and

64
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,680
subversion nowadays so i'm an artist i'm

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
a filmmaker i'm a technologist and i'm

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
also a consultant which pays some of my

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
bills uh i'm also an insultant sometimes

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
in the capacity of being a consultant so

69
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
i've insult people and they still pay me

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
money for the for that uh so that's good

71
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
uh

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
i deal a lot with the art world because

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
uh i consider myself an artist although

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
i have a very strained toxic

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
relationship

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
with art i uh well uh yeah do what you

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
love and you will work super [ __ ]

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
hard all the time with no separation or

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
any boundaries and also take everything

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
extremely personally yeah that is art uh

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
art uh it's it's from

82
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
alame whatever that is so art is a

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
special place for special people in a

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
really bad font

85
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
and that's why most of the time i refer

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
to the work i'm doing as context hacking

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
sounds a little bit nicer something

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
that's a little bit more uh compatible

89
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
with uh tick tock or something like that

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
so why context hacking so first of all

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
the context of where you put something

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,120
is extremely important you could have i

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
mean there's some of these like youtube

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
videos where like a million dollar uh

95
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
cellist is playing in the new york

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,479
subway and nobody gives a [ __ ] uh and uh

97
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,120
yeah because that person is suddenly in

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
a different context you can he can do

99
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,080
that or she can do that very performance

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
in madison square garden and in the new

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,160
york subway and it would be maybe

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
technically the same performance but of

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
course it's not because the context of

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
where you do something

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
is very important and hacking is super

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
interesting for me first of all because

107
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
i'm a nerdy person

108
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,160
but

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
the history of hacking is also related

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
to the history of pranking so

111
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,199
at mit in the 60s it was a very good

112
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
hack if you would pull off a good

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
student prank you would i don't know

114
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,240
take a volkswagen beetle and put it on

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
the roof of the biology department or

116
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
something like that that would be a good

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,960
hack and that term of hacking then got

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
adopted uh like in the 70s of course uh

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,039
in the

120
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,280
emerging markets of

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,759
of the personal computing sphere in the

122
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,600
internet sphere so uh context hacking is

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
what i define most of the work i'm doing

124
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,039
so there's always a way to get a message

125
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
across but sometimes you need a couple

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
of adapters to do that

127
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
so i'm interested in playing with the

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
absurdities of power

129
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
and i mean our world is sheer power and

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
there are people who have more power and

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
there are people who have less power but

132
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,240
power nowadays and i'm going to talk

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,919
about that a little bit is more like a

134
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,479
jellyfish sometimes so you have to know

135
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,599
how to tickle the jellyfish so uh i'm

136
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,680
interested in emotional machines let's

137
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
call it that way as a filmmaker that's

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,039
something quite obvious because a film

139
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,680
is a very why is this moving faster than

140
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,360
i talk uh okay so an emotional machine

141
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
is something where you

142
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,639
um

143
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
let's call it where you construct

144
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
something that should have an emotional

145
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,120
reaction in a person you create a film

146
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
that is uh making you cry or making you

147
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
aware of a problem or something like

148
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,599
that so

149
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
but it should make you aware of that

150
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,440
problem in a way that you can relate to

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
it that you have a good emotional

152
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
response to it a good horror film will

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,599
make you

154
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,120
scared uh or a good comedy will make you

155
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
laugh uh but but of course there's more

156
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
to it and i think that most art

157
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
and also most hacking is an emotional

158
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,800
machine of some sort so uh best of 1986

159
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
i was 11 years old and it was the year

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
that the challenger blew up and it was

161
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,240
not the timeline of for all mankind uh

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
chernobyl blew up which was a good tv

163
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,199
show on on hbo

164
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
and this strange guy eureka came to

165
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
power in the austrian freedom party and

166
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,039
of course when there's freedom in it

167
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
it's the fascists

168
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,639
so euro qaeda became pretty much the

169
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
blueprint although not many people know

170
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
of him besides uh growing up in austria

171
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
in the 1980s and 1990s

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
eurocaiden became the blueprint of what

173
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
people like that [ __ ] are doing

174
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
nowadays so jurek haider created the

175
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
blueprint of something that we now call

176
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
the old right or uh like the the

177
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
right right uh mainstreamization of of

178
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
politics and he was super good at it

179
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
until he killed himself in a car crash

180
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
uh so uh

181
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,519
what about you and the car crash but

182
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
okay let's talk about that later okay so

183
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,839
uh in 1986 that was also the the year uh

184
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,320
because of the glory of uh

185
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
late night

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,760
tv i first saw this film and it's called

187
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,000
network from 1976 so it was already a

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,959
little bit

189
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
less than 10 years old and network is

190
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
still one of the best films of the 20th

191
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
century if you have not seen network uh

192
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,720
i cannot believe how incredibly

193
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
dated the film is if you watch it and at

194
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,279
the same time how incredibly visionary

195
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
it's a film about the tv age and it's a

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,399
film about subversion in the tvh and and

197
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
how advertisement takes subversion and

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
uses it for its purpose but it's just

199
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
like an incredibly great film and you

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
should watch it also if you want to

201
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
learn about late

202
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,080
late capitalism so uh it was also the

203
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
time that i kind of grew up and became a

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
political

205
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,240
person because i was interested in in

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,079
weird science fiction stuff like

207
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
neuromancer just uh

208
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,519
was translated to german uh around 1986

209
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,040
and i read it for the first time i

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
watched robocop

211
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,079
uh just an incredibly great

212
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
satire of reaganomics and thatcherism

213
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,560
but also an interesting film

214
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
where like a european

215
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
author

216
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
cinema guy

217
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
comes to the states

218
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
and makes pretty much like the best

219
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,079
satire

220
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,959
about

221
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,600
what's wrong with 1980s capitalism and

222
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
he just

223
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,320
bluntly says you do not want this to

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
happen the world should not look like

225
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
this in 25 years

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
and of course it looks like this 25

227
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
years later yeah

228
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
and we'll talk about that a little bit

229
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
later why i think that happened it was

230
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
the year that i got my first ibm

231
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,560
computer and i uh first

232
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
got a modem and was online

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
frequented like bulletin board systems

234
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,079
uh

235
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
stuff like that weird

236
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
i looked like this

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
i downloaded my first online porn

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,600
picture from austria from a german

239
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
bulletin board systems it took seven

240
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
hours

241
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,760
it was 320 times 200 black and white you

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
couldn't see [ __ ]

243
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
uh but it was like if you converted to

244
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
nowaday currency it was like 1500 bucks

245
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
download

246
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
uh because it was a long distance call

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
from austria to germany and then and my

248
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
my dad found out and said like what the

249
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
[ __ ] i have a stack of porn in the

250
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,160
basement why did

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,399
and

252
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
and i said like well you know like uh

253
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,320
hacking is a crime of curiosity

254
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
i don't know

255
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
well okay but yeah

256
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,279
yes uh

257
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,600
so but around that time like all of that

258
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
stuff like in in a young person's life

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
kind of like shaped me and i it got me

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
interested in stuff so there uh a couple

261
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
of personal emancipation stories so like

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
actually two anecdotes about that so

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
first of all actually that's et i'm not

264
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,360
sure if you're familiar with et

265
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
anymore but i watched et with my

266
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
grandmother

267
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,240
in in the small cinema in my hometown

268
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
yeah and i was completely blown away of

269
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
course because of the special effects

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
and everything and it was scary and it

271
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
was exciting it was just like wonderful

272
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
it's a it's still a good example of an

273
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
emotional machine

274
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
et and uh and my grandmother was a

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
little bit

276
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,200
you know

277
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,680
she didn't know what to do with that so

278
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,800
she didn't really understand or

279
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,519
i think she got it and she liked it

280
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,120
but she was also kind of like what the

281
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
[ __ ] happened uh and of course i mean

282
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,399
she was like the the war generation and

283
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
and she grew up with all the nazi

284
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
propaganda and all that stuff yeah she

285
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
was never a real nazi or anything like

286
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
that and she wasn't even specifically

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
reactionary or right wing or something

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
like that but i remember that i was

289
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
there like eight nine years old

290
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,200
looking at her and she was kind of like

291
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
talking to herself ah

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
yeah yeah e.t

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
that that was interesting yeah yeah yeah

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
spielberg

295
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
a jew yes a jew

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480
and i like i look like what the [ __ ]

297
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,160
even with like eight or nine years old i

298
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
didn't know what the [ __ ] has this

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
anything to do with anything uh but for

300
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
me it was like one of these moments

301
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
where you think of like hey

302
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,959
there is something bigger going on

303
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,880
that i don't understand yet there are

304
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
kind of cultural tropes there there's

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
racism there there there are underlying

306
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
powers going on

307
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
that that burst out

308
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
and that one one of these moments where

309
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,959
one of these like things

310
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,440
burst out of my grandmother and i kind

311
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
of like saw with like nine years

312
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,399
i i would say it was almost like the

313
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,560
entire twentieth history 20th century

314
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
history like combined in like this one

315
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,199
moment of my of my my grandmother trying

316
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,040
to put the film

317
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
in in the context so the second story

318
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
that's a couple of years later when i

319
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
was like 15 or 16 or something like that

320
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
is my grand

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
parents were very catholic

322
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,279
my

323
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,040
parents

324
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,600
super fast like abandoned roman

325
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
catholicism and became super new age and

326
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,279
new uag also in the context of like

327
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,199
right-wing conspiracies and stuff like

328
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,480
that so

329
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
stuff that is now pretty much mainstream

330
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
yeah and uh

331
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
so so my parents were pretty early with

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
that stuff they had all the books in

333
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
there in their

334
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,839
little library and i remember i always

335
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
had strange conversations with them

336
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,839
because i couldn't understand what they

337
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,279
were talking about or i didn't

338
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
understand how they would put things in

339
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
their ideology or whatever in in their

340
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
in the frame in their context

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,760
and uh so my first rebellion pretty much

342
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
was uh because my parents were so new

343
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,880
agey my first rebellion was to adopt the

344
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
scientific method because it was a

345
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
strange way of like enraging them

346
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
like asking for proof or

347
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,079
stuff like that or

348
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
like peer review

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,680
which is kind of weird for a 15 year old

350
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
guy to ask for peer review when debating

351
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
with your parents but it was like that

352
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,079
and i'm showing this picture here with

353
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,480
this little pendulum because my mother

354
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
was always

355
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
like using the pendulum for example on

356
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,720
food

357
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
she would have a moldy apple and she

358
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
would use the pendulum and ask the

359
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,160
pendulum can i still eat this apple can

360
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
i still eat this apple and the pendulum

361
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
would say yes and then she would eat the

362
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
apple and i was like what the [ __ ] and

363
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,560
so at some point i said like i wanna

364
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,360
have an experiment with you mother

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
and she said like okay i'll do it so

366
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,600
what i did is i i said i want you

367
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,759
to use your pendulum to tell me the

368
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,240
first 50 digits

369
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
of pi

370
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
and she kind of knew the 3.14

371
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,680
but not the rest so she was sitting

372
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,639
there a whole afternoon with like

373
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
zero one two three four five on a piece

374
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
of paper and she would put her finger on

375
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,120
the on on a d on on zero

376
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,839
and then ask it if it's that number so

377
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,160
for a whole afternoon hours and hours

378
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
she was really like doing the first 50

379
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
uh digits of pi and not a single number

380
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,279
was right

381
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
and then i came back and said like hey

382
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
well not a single number is right so i

383
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,240
assume you now see the points that i'm

384
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
trying to make

385
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,320
you should not do that

386
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
and she said like ah

387
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,759
i was just in a bad mood i'll do it

388
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,040
tomorrow and and then it will be right

389
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
and then she she got a coke or something

390
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
and then she came back and said like

391
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,680
who tells me that your numbers are

392
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,839
actually correct maybe my numbers are

393
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,120
right yeah

394
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
and there you have anti-vexers and all

395
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,319
the other guys like condensed in this

396
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,919
one story because there is no use of to

397
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
a certain degree

398
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,400
arguing with a person like that because

399
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
it is so ingrained in their personal

400
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,679
belief system and ideology that whatever

401
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,199
you throw at them

402
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
they they will not accept it or they

403
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
will find a way around it um okay but

404
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,720
let's leave it there okay

405
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
so uh when i was 15 16 i started reading

406
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
stuff like the industrial culture

407
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
handbook by research i was interested in

408
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,480
novels by ian banks so i got

409
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
politicized in my nerdy

410
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,880
in my nerdy ways and that was very very

411
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
interesting to me and it also opened up

412
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
it i made connections uh and i've

413
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
started to understand what robocop is

414
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,520
about and what those books are about and

415
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
that they're kind of like warning

416
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
signs they're they're they're like this

417
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
cautionary tales about how the future

418
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
should be or should not be

419
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
and uh so uh i also was super interested

420
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
in like stuff like h.r giger uh who

421
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
created aliens so it was kind of like an

422
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
early way of like

423
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
being interested in underground culture

424
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
a strange culture but also mainstream

425
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
art and

426
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
out of all of that monochrome started so

427
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
monochrome was my way with also with my

428
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,760
friends to find a way and monochrome

429
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
started as a fan zine so uh and uh also

430
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
as a little bulletin board system

431
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,559
message board so i wanted to to to kind

432
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,080
of like talk about all of that stuff all

433
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
the stuff that was interesting to me uh

434
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
that people should talk about but didn't

435
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
talk about

436
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,320
uh i i wanted to find a format to talk

437
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
about that also kind of like share

438
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
experiences like my crazy parents or or

439
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
uh a book i read or something like that

440
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
so i

441
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
we started this like bulletin board

442
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
system but not many people were on there

443
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
because not many people were in bulletin

444
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
board systems in in austria in 1991 or

445
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,559
two

446
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,679
and uh and also the fanzine was a good

447
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
thing and we kind of still do it but if

448
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,280
you do an underground fanzine uh you can

449
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
be happy that 200 people read it maybe

450
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
400 if it's sitting in someone's

451
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
bathroom you know but you you can't

452
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,600
reach people if you are using a medium

453
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
that is

454
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
it's inscribed in the medium that it is

455
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
underground that you would only find

456
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,280
those uh fanzines in specific shops that

457
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
everyday regular people wouldn't go

458
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
there so and the idea was always trying

459
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
to reach people and telling them

460
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,799
something about our life and what we

461
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,679
think

462
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,640
we should make to or do to to change the

463
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
world so by the way that's a picture of

464
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
me and h.r giger when i was like 17 or

465
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,919
18. i called him on the phone because he

466
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
was still in the in the phone book back

467
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
then and i called him hey is this hr

468
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
giger can i can i drop by i would like

469
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
to do an interview with you for my crazy

470
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,410
little fan scene and he said

471
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,039
[Music]

472
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,679
and and then i went there and uh and i

473
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,440
saw his oscar and he glued a dildo onto

474
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
his oscar because

475
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
because he had some problems with some

476
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,159
u.s movie studios something like that so

477
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
i never took a picture of that and i i

478
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
i should be more like jason scott

479
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,360
sometimes okay so uh good uh i grew into

480
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
the punk and post-punk world because i

481
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,159
was definitely too young for for punk

482
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
number one but i i got into punk number

483
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
two and number three i guess in the

484
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
meantime it's punk number 12 or

485
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
something but i i don't know uh

486
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,320
looked like that and uh so what was

487
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,200
important for me is that uh that was

488
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
always the ideology of monochrome was

489
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,880
people don't want to listen to you

490
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
people don't want to be told about

491
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,559
things so you kind of have to find a way

492
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
into their brains you have to find a

493
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,559
good emotional machine to make them

494
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,120
interested in something

495
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
a thing that is more and more relevant

496
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
nowadays for example in the 90s

497
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,799
one of the hills i wanted to die on was

498
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
telling people about the internet and

499
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
especially as a leftist back then

500
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
many leftists in in austria and germany

501
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,760
were extremely

502
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,720
anti-technology they

503
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
a little bit later they wouldn't touch

504
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
cell phones or they wouldn't want to be

505
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
online there was this like ingrained

506
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,240
angst of being controlled or surveilled

507
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
or uh i guess with with the european

508
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
history of of nazi dom and all that

509
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
stuff i guess to a certain degree it's

510
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,919
true that that hey you don't want big

511
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
institutions or governments

512
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,240
know too much about you

513
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
they don't

514
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
we shouldn't be controlled by them so

515
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
but i had the feeling in the 1990s that

516
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
many many

517
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
people in the left

518
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,480
were overly uh anxious of that form of

519
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,360
communication that form of of um

520
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
reaching out to to the world

521
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,159
uh and uh the problem was that i saw is

522
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,760
that more and more

523
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,840
kind of

524
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,799
libertarian-minded people especially in

525
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,919
the us

526
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
were going online and you're like

527
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
california or ballis you know

528
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,799
that that uh many people what we now

529
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,520
call kind of like the the silicon valley

530
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
elite or whatever it is

531
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
of course that started back then it

532
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
started actually way earlier but but you

533
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,200
could see this ideology uh kind of like

534
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,760
manifest itself in the internet this

535
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,480
strange combination of hippie dom and

536
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,120
ultra capitalism that is super

537
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
represented of course by a character

538
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,440
like steve jobs uh that that just like

539
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
just took hold of the internet and i

540
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,799
just wanted my friends and people that i

541
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,600
trusted and people that had

542
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,080
similar political views online

543
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,440
to help shape that new medium and to to

544
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,799
help it

545
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
stay weird

546
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
and to a certain degree of course we all

547
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
failed

548
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,799
but uh but that was one of one of my

549
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,760
hills of the 1990s

550
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
but in general the question was also as

551
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
a group as a fanzine as an art group

552
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
what can we do

553
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
to make the world better and the

554
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
question was

555
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
to a certain degree what is the best

556
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,679
medium

557
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,320
of mass distribution the best weapon of

558
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,880
mass distribution of an id and sometimes

559
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
it's okay to make a fancy and sometimes

560
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,360
it's okay to have a 25-page essay with a

561
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,760
hundred footnotes or something like that

562
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
but but it will only reach certain

563
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,720
people in certain domains and in certain

564
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,440
spheres so you have to be open-minded

565
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
about the media that you use so so the

566
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
idea was like what is the best medium to

567
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
spread a certain message and i could

568
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
tell you like many many stories about

569
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,640
things that we did uh many of the things

570
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880
i still can't believe we did and i

571
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
probably couldn't tell you about them

572
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,159
because we would probably still go to

573
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,840
jail but uh

574
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
but the thing is that

575
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
the experimentation of my life and the

576
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,320
experimentation of my group was always

577
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
trying to figure out what works and what

578
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,880
doesn't work and

579
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,200
so talking about art and tech and

580
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,360
subversion and disruption although

581
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,760
disruption is a really bad term in the

582
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,919
meantime uh

583
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,960
there's fail yeah uh the

584
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
the question for me was always

585
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
what is

586
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,240
going on what is changing because uh i

587
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
have this image here of the stop sign

588
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
and this strange image from

589
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,159
1986 in vienna

590
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,520
which is

591
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,000
one of the early performances of the

592
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
so-called viennese actionists the

593
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
viennese actionists were super hardcore

594
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
artists in the 1960s who did extremely

595
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,440
martial and extremely brutal

596
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,200
i don't know how else to describe it

597
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
brutal performances they had

598
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
performances like this where people were

599
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,159
[ __ ] into college auditoriums and

600
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,480
stuff like that and of course they they

601
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
they were they were the talk of the

602
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
nation so everyone talked about it uh

603
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
austria was a very

604
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
uh still is but back then even more so

605
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,799
catholic country uh conservative and

606
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,480
doing something like that

607
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
uh would

608
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
bring some of those people

609
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
on the verge of going to jail for many

610
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
many years

611
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
or bring you on to the

612
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
uh

613
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
headline of like would bring you on on

614
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
the front cover of of the biggest

615
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,080
austrian newspapers of the day uh and uh

616
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
i kind of like didn't really grow up

617
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,679
with that kind of stuff but as an

618
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,440
austrian you kind of know about it you

619
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
know about oh there's this crazy crazy

620
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
niche guy who paints with blood and

621
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
there's this and then that it's somewhat

622
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,840
part of austrian popular culture that

623
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
stuff like that happened so it was

624
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
interesting to me and uh for example

625
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
that's going to bruce

626
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
who was arrested for this performance

627
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
where he was like walking around in the

628
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
white suit with white face paint and

629
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,640
just like a like kind of like fake blood

630
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
on his body and he got arrested for this

631
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
and went to jail for three weeks

632
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
i mean nowadays you can be happy uh that

633
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
something like that

634
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
happens like in the year 2000 on jackass

635
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,440
and nowadays that it's on some mom's

636
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,400
facebook so because nobody gives a [ __ ]

637
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
about that stuff anymore this is just

638
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,960
like you know this is like the attention

639
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,159
economy of everyday influencers on tech

640
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
talk so what happened between

641
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,159
1968 in austria and the same of course

642
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,880
true in in the united states we had

643
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
people here like abby hoffman etc who

644
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
did very interesting very very uh

645
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,159
to to reuse that frame uh brutal uh

646
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
performances but nowadays i mean you

647
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,640
can't really shock anyone with this [ __ ]

648
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
anymore yeah and

649
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
the thing is that of course society has

650
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,559
changed and subversion has changed so uh

651
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,679
back then

652
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,760
in the u.s also in in austria we had a

653
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
very strict disciplinary society and a

654
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
disciplinary society is a society where

655
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,520
you kind of know how the hierarchies

656
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
work you know who is the boss and who

657
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
has to obey that boss you have the

658
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
classic capitalist who is running a

659
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,840
company uh who is controlling everything

660
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
and he was

661
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,000
throwing out people uh firing people or

662
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
not uh you had factories where it was

663
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,159
quite clear who is working where in so

664
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,840
the hierarchies are super clear in a

665
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,760
disciplinary society that's why it's

666
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
called the disciplinary society because

667
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
it is clear what person can discipline

668
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,520
what person

669
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,679
and it never changes

670
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,679
you had stuff like for example

671
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,480
surveillance cameras where something

672
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,200
that people would look at in fear that

673
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,640
there is a surveillance camera they

674
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,399
could see me

675
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,520
like 1984 is like the wet dream of a

676
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,000
disciplinary society

677
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,559
but the cool thing about 1984 in a

678
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,039
disciplinary society is that it has

679
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,159
subversion embedded in that society you

680
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,039
can

681
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,600
disobey the stop sign and just cross the

682
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,679
streets you might get killed by a car

683
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,600
but there is this moment of subversion

684
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,320
where you for yourself decide i want to

685
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,120
not obey that stop sign i want to smash

686
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
that camera i want to create a union to

687
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,039
stick the finger to the man or something

688
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,960
like that so there were because it was

689
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
so clear how it's

690
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,080
created and how it's functioning the

691
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
machine

692
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
of the disciplinary society it was easy

693
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,760
to find ways to to hack it in a way

694
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,320
the gold standard was a classic form of

695
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,720
a disciplinary society in the financial

696
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
terms in a financial realm because at

697
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,840
least the world could could say like

698
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,399
there is one standard in finances and it

699
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,640
is gold and we all agreed to it but they

700
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
got rid of it in the 1970s

701
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
uh is masturbation a sin we're in a

702
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,279
catholic uh institution of course it is

703
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,200
a sin and you will go to hell

704
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
but then the [ __ ] second vaticanum

705
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
happened and everything was a little bit

706
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,559
more flubby but still okay masturbation

707
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,720
sin you do it you go to hell for all

708
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,080
eternity so even like god is a concept

709
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
of a disciplinary society because even

710
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,120
if you can prove he exists or not

711
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,640
there is still the factual

712
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
weight of that

713
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,520
strange non-existing institution of god

714
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
that makes people behave in certain ways

715
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,640
on earth

716
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,559
so yeah the stop sign

717
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
in a society of control and that's

718
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,399
what's happening right now for the last

719
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,960
20 years some people call it like like

720
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
the neoliberal reformation blah blah

721
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,799
blah doesn't matter i like the term

722
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,120
society of control because a society of

723
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,559
control

724
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,320
it's a little bit misleading

725
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
a term because it is not that someone is

726
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
controlling you but you're controlling

727
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,520
yourself uh smile you are on camera is

728
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
like a classic thing that you would see

729
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,279
like in a bar or something like that so

730
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,559
where suddenly this orwellian they're

731
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
watching us and it's bad and we should

732
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
resist it it suddenly turned into like a

733
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,720
smiley face

734
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
almost like a racist caricature of

735
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,760
something of an asian person

736
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,480
but smile you're on camera uh it's a

737
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,159
good thing that you're on camera because

738
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,559
we want to protect you and people

739
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,960
actually really feel protected by that

740
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
uh

741
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,360
your boss is your friend nowadays

742
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,760
because you know he's your buddy and if

743
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,679
he asks you well

744
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
can you stay in on the weekend because i

745
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
want to go uh on my yacht with my new

746
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,000
girlfriend or something like that and we

747
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
really need someone to to do this

748
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,919
paperwork you say like of course i'll do

749
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,399
that you're my friend harry

750
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
uh and of course harry is not your

751
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,120
friend harry is just like using the

752
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,679
mechanisms of psychological control on

753
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,640
you

754
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,799
the next week he might kick you out of

755
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,960
your job but but

756
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
but you still feel bad telling your

757
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,399
friend

758
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,600
no

759
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,240
so that that's how for example at ikea

760
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
in in austria and germany uh there is

761
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
this like formal way an informal way of

762
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,159
speaking uh so c form and do forms so do

763
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,200
is only with close friends and c is you

764
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,559
know like with uh

765
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,240
people of authority or teachers or

766
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,120
something like that so at ikea

767
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,320
shops

768
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
they forbid

769
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,720
the formal way of talking

770
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,200
to your boss so they enforce the

771
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,919
informal way they enforce the do

772
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,120
uh address because they realize that if

773
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
you're purdue if you're talking

774
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
informally with your boss

775
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
then you work better

776
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,600
and you obey your boss better so that is

777
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
classic this

778
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
classic disciplinary society is shifting

779
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,640
into a society of control of course the

780
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,080
basic

781
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,120
power lines are the same the same people

782
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,559
have the money the same the same

783
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,240
structures are still there there are

784
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,559
still hierarchies but the hierarchies

785
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,279
appear flatter and because they appear

786
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,120
flatter everything looks a little bit

787
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,679
more nicey uh of course i'm talking here

788
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,679
about western liberal societies i'm not

789
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,799
talking about

790
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
iran or something like that yeah or

791
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
north korea those are still strict

792
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,279
disciplinary societies and for example

793
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,799
with like gay gay and queer people in uh

794
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,039
in iran where they're really fearing to

795
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
to be killed uh if they're outed or

796
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,919
something like that they have of course

797
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,200
very interesting uh subversive tactics

798
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,080
to

799
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,960
to to meet or or to do their their their

800
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,840
stuff uh but uh but

801
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
let's stay with in the realm of of the

802
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,159
western liberal societies and i couldn't

803
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,200
find an

804
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
image of masturbation online so i took

805
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
this one uh

806
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,200
it uh

807
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,760
yeah even nowadays like masturbation

808
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,919
even for the catholic church uh there is

809
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,679
a difference uh you're not going

810
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,840
strictly to hell anymore but i remember

811
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,679
when i grew up

812
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,080
after the second vaticanum

813
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,399
i was learning about masturbation in my

814
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,640
in my religious class at school and they

815
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
would say like yes yes you're allowed to

816
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,360
masturbate but please be considerate

817
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
about it

818
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,240
and

819
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,320
and like and then you want to masturbate

820
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,840
and you how can i do this

821
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
in a considerable

822
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,630
way

823
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,000
[Music]

824
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,480
and then you don't want to do it anymore

825
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,399
so so that's how they get you they get

826
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,360
into your brain and and

827
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
what

828
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,559
you are doing it wrong yes maybe we can

829
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,240
learn from the catholics that you really

830
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
only masturbate in a proper way if you

831
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
feel guilt

832
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
but but um

833
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,360
who knows

834
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
but and even like the gold standard

835
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
doesn't exist anymore now we have like

836
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,200
this like 2008 what can i tell you

837
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
nobody knows [ __ ] about the financial

838
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,159
system anymore it somehow works or not

839
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,279
and uh yeah well yeah good society of

840
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,760
control and even stuff like ingress i'm

841
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
not sure how many of you have ever ever

842
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,560
played ingress yeah ingress was this

843
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,800
like interesting trap that google

844
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
created it's it's it's an augmented

845
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,960
reality game where you play on the green

846
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,879
or on the blue side and you have to

847
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,760
geolocate things you have to put like a

848
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,079
blue or green sticker digital sticker so

849
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,440
to speak on on a monument on a building

850
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
on something like that so

851
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
millions of people played and are still

852
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,960
playing ingress

853
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
because it's a fun game but they are

854
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
actually working for google and not even

855
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,599
knowing that because they are

856
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,040
uh putting

857
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,760
geo information geodata into google

858
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,960
system uh and and google of course uses

859
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,480
that but so in a society of control we

860
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,520
work for corporations they don't pay us

861
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,400
and

862
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,240
and most people don't know it they are

863
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
tricked by interesting forms of

864
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,000
gamification

865
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
to do labor-intensive data entry work

866
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,480
for free for a company okay so

867
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,680
uh

868
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
blah blah blah blah blah world's largest

869
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,760
company does known caps largest

870
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
degradation provider no real estate blah

871
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
blah blah blah blah blah blah so the

872
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,200
world somehow changed and uh

873
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
it also

874
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
is in a strange form a bad form of

875
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
disruption that's going on so who is

876
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,160
running the planet that guy uh of course

877
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,079
the white nerd

878
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
and uh well actually

879
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,320
that guy uh so

880
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,119
and why do i use this picture of [ __ ]

881
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,400
elon musk uh with a flame thrower

882
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
because i think it exemplifies

883
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,440
look at that

884
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,400
and

885
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
the fun part is

886
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,560
the fun part is so let's let's jump back

887
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,480
who is running the planet of course

888
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
nerds are running the planet it's the

889
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
same people that grew up in my

890
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,800
generation it's the people who watched

891
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
robocop it's the people who read the

892
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,599
same

893
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,000
magazines like i did who watch the same

894
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,520
films like spaceballs etc etc etc

895
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,400
and

896
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
those people decided

897
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
that it's so cool that there is robocop

898
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,040
that we actually should build a world

899
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,599
that is robocop they didn't get the

900
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,960
message

901
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
out of some like strange form of

902
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
nostalgia or something like that and

903
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
it's people really like elon musk who

904
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
said in an interview in a documentary

905
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,040
recently that he really started uh a

906
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
little company selling flamethrowers

907
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,040
because he likes baseball so much he saw

908
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,000
the spaceballs flamethrower and decided

909
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
i can do that i can actually sell

910
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
flamethrowers well elon you didn't get

911
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
the message

912
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,400
there's

913
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,920
it's a joke it's a joke about like the

914
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,960
[ __ ] up merchandise cult going on in

915
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,119
nerd culture and and mel brooks that did

916
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,599
an interesting statement here but it got

917
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,960
kind of like

918
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
misunderstood and i think a lot of that

919
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,599
stuff is happening in nerd culture

920
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,119
especially if people uh still think they

921
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
are they're underground uh

922
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
in my in my

923
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,280
uh age i got like actually really beaten

924
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,440
up in high school because i was a nerd

925
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
uh it kind of changed nerds have a lot

926
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,839
of power a lot of buying power uh

927
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,280
we are mainstream yeah at least some of

928
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
us are mainstream yeah

929
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,560
but we have to kind of like remind

930
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,520
ourselves what we do with this power and

931
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
with what we do with this

932
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
creative wonderful energy that we all

933
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
have and not start another [ __ ]

934
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
gamergate or something like that so the

935
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,960
mainstreamization of descent

936
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
i would call it is that that

937
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,400
capitalism is a very adaptive entity it

938
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
likes new stuff

939
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
and it likes to adapt that new stuff and

940
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
incorporate it in its

941
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
structure that's why most of hollywood

942
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
films out there i think in the meantime

943
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
it's 90 of all hollywood films are made

944
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,079
by marvel or something like that i'm not

945
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,079
sure about that statistics but you can

946
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,880
probably google it and find it's true uh

947
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,839
so

948
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,880
so does subversion itself need to change

949
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,839
it has to because society works

950
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,359
differently nowadays so we have people

951
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,200
who think they are subversive and they

952
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,760
are anti-mainstream on the street

953
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,599
demonstrating against vaccination

954
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,680
demonstrating against covet measures or

955
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,040
something like that

956
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,760
they all think they they are underground

957
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,240
they all think that they are sticking it

958
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
to the man

959
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,160
i somewhat agree with the whole thing

960
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,760
about that the government wants to

961
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,720
control people but not

962
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,839
because the problem is uh

963
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,760
this quote i mean this quote is not a

964
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
problem i like this quote a lot it is

965
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
not important what you want to know but

966
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,800
why you want to know it and that's by

967
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,240
michelle foucault and i think this is

968
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
exactly what i'm talking about this year

969
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,280
why are these people on the streets

970
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,200
why do they want to stop vaccination why

971
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,640
do they want

972
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,800
uh to to

973
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
storm the capital whatever it is yeah so

974
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,520
what is the agenda uh behind all of this

975
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
uh so why are they doing it it's not

976
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
important what they are doing i mean of

977
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,119
course it's also important what they are

978
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,760
doing but it is important to analyze why

979
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,599
they are doing it so why in comic sense

980
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,560
uh

981
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,720
i guess it's getting a little bit back

982
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,160
to the story that i told you about my

983
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,880
mother why is my mother so obsessed with

984
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
new age why is my mother obsessed with

985
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,800
like creating a new form of mathematics

986
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
because she failed in the test i gave

987
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,480
her about

988
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,320
the pendulum and pie

989
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,960
they are all looking for meaning

990
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,119
my my parents are the classic boomer

991
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,800
generation that got like

992
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
i don't like hit over the head by

993
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,160
popular culture and by the by the

994
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,640
by the change uh also that

995
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,359
uh disciplinary society

996
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,599
turning towards society of control

997
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,920
happened and all that kind of stuff so

998
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,640
the question is like and i try sometimes

999
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
to do that but of course i know it's

1000
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,280
hard it's hard to talk to my parents

1001
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
why they don't want to get vaccinated

1002
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
why they are still using a pendulum and

1003
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,839
stuff like that it's super hard

1004
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,560
because we're talking about ideology and

1005
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,839
at the same time we're talking about

1006
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,920
morality and at the same time we talk

1007
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,680
about agenda everyone has an agenda

1008
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,359
and the agenda might be as simple as

1009
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,359
like i want to get rich okay that's

1010
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,119
that's one of the prime agendas in

1011
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,839
capitalism yes of course yeah uh but the

1012
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,960
question is getting a little bit more

1013
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
tricky when you talk about morality so

1014
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,920
my dad for example who is anti-semitic

1015
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,839
to a certain degree and i always ask

1016
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,839
myself why

1017
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,640
and i kind of found out that he is

1018
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
actually deep in his core

1019
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,880
he doesn't like what's going on he

1020
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,079
doesn't like what's going on in the

1021
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,920
world he doesn't like that the world is

1022
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,680
polluted that that people are being

1023
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,000
killed and he always looked for an

1024
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,400
outlet he wanted to know why is that

1025
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
happening and of course it's happening

1026
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,560
for him because the jews are running the

1027
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,040
planet uh of course that's not true

1028
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
most jewish friends of mine are

1029
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,440
they don't have a dime you know there's

1030
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,359
like but there is still this strange

1031
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,960
form of racism uh this anti-semitic form

1032
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,680
of racism where it's a racism where you

1033
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
don't look down

1034
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,920
at a certain people but you look up at

1035
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,240
them and say like they are so all

1036
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
encompassing and powerful and they run

1037
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,920
everything in hollywood and blah blah

1038
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720
blah we have to fight them we don't we

1039
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
don't we don't look down on them we we

1040
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
actively need to fight them and that was

1041
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,720
pretty much like the basic core of nazi

1042
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,520
ideology try to get rid of them and and

1043
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,680
and rid the planet of of all its

1044
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,200
problems

1045
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,880
no so the question is like uh how do i

1046
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,599
deal then with a person like my dad

1047
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,400
who

1048
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,319
pray basically has

1049
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,640
the same vector he wants to make the

1050
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,960
world better but he has a completely

1051
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
different mindset applied onto why he

1052
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,440
thinks the world is bad and why he wants

1053
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,280
to change it and how he wants to change

1054
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,319
it

1055
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,240
i mean the problem is we're all little

1056
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,160
context hackers in that sense it's so

1057
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,599
hard to sit at home you know

1058
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,040
thanksgiving dinner or something like

1059
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
that you have like strange

1060
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,880
parents or strange relatives or whoever

1061
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,560
is that you're talking to or the cab

1062
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,280
driver who is racist or whatever yeah

1063
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
but i mean

1064
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,480
it's all our job to a certain degree

1065
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
to to to play with them in in in a

1066
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,400
meaningful but also powerful powerful

1067
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,119
way uh well yeah i'm not saying it's a

1068
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
lie but it's a lie so so how can you get

1069
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
that message across

1070
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,520
uh sometimes as i said uh it's good to

1071
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,680
make a film or or

1072
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,640
write a book or do a performance uh in

1073
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
the public sphere

1074
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,800
sometimes you're it's almost like having

1075
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,319
little theater place for people that you

1076
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,720
need to educate or need to play with so

1077
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,040
for example in my case with my parents

1078
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,920
i'm not fully engaging with them with

1079
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,760
what i really think i could never tell

1080
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,440
them that i'm pretty much like a marxist

1081
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,800
or something like that now they would

1082
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,359
never accept that yeah some people in

1083
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,800
the audience here will probably not

1084
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,280
accept that but but uh the question is

1085
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,040
like how what is the best way to implant

1086
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,960
the virus so

1087
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,800
freedom not fear for example was an

1088
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,280
interesting statement uh that the ccc

1089
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,040
came up with the chaos communication

1090
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
club a couple of years ago that is now

1091
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,480
used uh by the alt-right uh in uh in

1092
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,480
germany and other uh in other cities so

1093
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,200
sometimes slogans are not enough a

1094
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
slogan will be

1095
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,240
abused

1096
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,000
freedom not fear is not a statement that

1097
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,240
can be put in a category a right winger

1098
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
can say the left bringer can say it it's

1099
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,720
kind of meaningless the question is like

1100
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,240
how can we

1101
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,280
instill

1102
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,560
meaningful

1103
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,440
viral communication into the world

1104
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,280
so for example what does freedom even

1105
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
mean so

1106
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,319
in this room there where they're

1107
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
probably libertarians they're they're

1108
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,760
anarchists they're they're marxists

1109
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,920
there there's so many different forms of

1110
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
people who probably can't agree on what

1111
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,280
freedom is so for example for me freedom

1112
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,000
no i just like don't deal with this term

1113
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,760
anymore it's so laden with with uh

1114
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,640
wrongness that no i mean from my

1115
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,960
personal perspective i say that freedom

1116
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,480
in the way that we're debating it only

1117
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,400
exists because there is a nation-state

1118
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,440
and in a

1119
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,400
state grants you a freedom as a citizen

1120
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,960
if you're not a citizen of that state it

1121
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,560
doesn't grant you anything

1122
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,000
so freedom is nothing that is human or

1123
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
existed for

1124
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
thousands of years no freedom is

1125
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
something that is as a concept came up

1126
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,720
as

1127
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,119
a concept within the concept of the

1128
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,280
nation-state that is like now 300 years

1129
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
old or something like that so

1130
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
what happened to solidarity like another

1131
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,400
term so why do we have to fight with

1132
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
people about vaccination when the

1133
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,880
vaccination is helping us all of course

1134
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,800
there are counter

1135
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,359
ideologies going against the solidarity

1136
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,200
and some people would even say like it

1137
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,160
is my solidarity duty to not being

1138
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
vaccinated because

1139
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,480
because we have to fight big pharma i

1140
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,319
mean i agree that we have to fight big

1141
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,640
pharma but not because they make science

1142
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,079
they're like there are better reasons to

1143
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,240
fight big pharma not not because of

1144
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
vaccinations

1145
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,400
so what is the root cause of

1146
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,560
conspiratorial thinking so the root

1147
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,800
cause of conspiratorial thinking is that

1148
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
there are conspiracies i'm not

1149
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,240
disagreeing with that i'm not

1150
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,079
disagreeing with that there are people

1151
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,880
conspiring to do things

1152
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,839
corruption i mean

1153
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,240
corruption is a form of conspiracy if

1154
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,079
you want to call it but it's not that

1155
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,040
strange all-encompassing a couple of

1156
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,000
people

1157
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,400
on on the on the tip of the pyramid are

1158
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,319
controlling everything that's not how

1159
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,880
capitalism works uh we're all our

1160
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,200
biggest enemies ourself

1161
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,880
because the very moment you believe in

1162
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
something like the profit motive you are

1163
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,160
your own worst enemy uh uh if if if i

1164
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,839
say that like from my personal

1165
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,160
ideological background or or from my

1166
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,880
belief system uh in in german there is

1167
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
this nice term called capitalismus

1168
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
critique which is like the critique of

1169
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,520
capitalism or for kurds the capitalism

1170
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,040
which is like

1171
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,400
the shortened like it's hard to

1172
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
translate the shortened capitalism

1173
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,960
critic the short like a reduced or

1174
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,040
reductionist way of of uh of critique of

1175
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
capitalism and that would pretty much be

1176
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,560
what my my my dad does my dad does the

1177
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,480
easy way out he says like the jews are

1178
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,800
to blame we have to find a way to get

1179
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,960
rid of the jews or like deal with it or

1180
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,440
or or or curb their power or whatever it

1181
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
is yeah uh and of course that's not how

1182
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,359
the world works he takes one aspect of

1183
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,880
of the very

1184
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,520
dynamic system of capitalism

1185
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,960
uh and just finds a scapegoat for that

1186
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,839
so

1187
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,119
he gets

1188
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,400
validated

1189
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,160
because every now and then he sees

1190
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,480
things on television or reads on his

1191
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,760
telegram [ __ ] fees or whatever it is

1192
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,800
that that gives him like uh like the

1193
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,119
moment of like i was right

1194
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,960
look at that there is another person

1195
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,280
it's uh yeah it's pretty much like

1196
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,520
uh the the more toxic version of my

1197
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,160
grandmother thinking about like

1198
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,880
why this film is so weird with e.t ah

1199
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,280
jew made it something like that yeah so

1200
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,800
there's people are

1201
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
we we're pattern machines we're looking

1202
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,119
for patterns uh and if you don't have

1203
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,559
the right tool set

1204
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,079
you will find patterns where there are

1205
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,760
no patterns or you will find patterns

1206
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,119
that are completely meaningless and

1207
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,839
useless

1208
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,480
so the way how we talk about fears and

1209
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,880
problems changes everything so i think

1210
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,920
that is why it is on us to a certain

1211
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,400
degree because it's also they are out

1212
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,720
there all the anti-vexes all the people

1213
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,440
the old writers they have their agenda

1214
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
they like to talk about their stuff all

1215
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,680
the time uh and sometimes they have the

1216
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,000
feeling like we gave up we gave up on it

1217
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,920
because it's just like too much a hassle

1218
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,359
of dealing with them it's just like

1219
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,680
they're just like and i i agree

1220
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,920
sometimes it's just like not worth

1221
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,200
dealing uh and the emotional labor that

1222
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,079
you put into that stuff uh is just like

1223
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,280
too much

1224
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,800
but if we all go back into our own

1225
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,319
digital beta maya there's this like

1226
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,400
period in austria in the in the early

1227
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
1800s where there was so much

1228
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,599
uh uh oppression uh

1229
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,480
so much

1230
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,119
suppression of thought and and free

1231
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,839
speech that led up to the revolution of

1232
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,040
1848 uh but for like 20 or 30 years

1233
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,359
people didn't talk about politics in

1234
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,599
austria they didn't talk about anything

1235
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,359
uh because they were so fearful that

1236
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,680
they might be captured or they might go

1237
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,119
to jail or something like that so what

1238
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,880
happened was this

1239
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,359
bidamaya which is uh this time frame

1240
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,079
that it happened where everyone was just

1241
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,760
like at home and if there was a

1242
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,359
political debate the political debate

1243
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,640
was at home

1244
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,440
and nowhere else uh but we cannot kind

1245
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,200
of like succumb to

1246
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,119
come into this like new age of the

1247
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
digital biedermeier and the strange

1248
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,640
thing about the digital betamine

1249
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,359
nowadays is that although

1250
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,760
we're all succumbing to this

1251
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
idea of like we don't want to deal it

1252
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,359
with it anymore

1253
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,119
at the same time we're dealing with it

1254
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
all the time online

1255
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,960
on facebook on twitter everywhere there

1256
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,720
is so much

1257
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,640
opinion out there

1258
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,480
that we all kind of like being washed

1259
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,280
away by opinion so the question is like

1260
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,640
how can we

1261
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,599
in this like super fragmented

1262
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,640
uh

1263
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,839
ocean of opinion that's still out there

1264
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:10,800
uh

1265
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,119
that has a couple of influences shaping

1266
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,319
it a couple of

1267
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,880
big media players shaping it how can you

1268
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
make a change there and sometimes the

1269
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,680
answer is you can't it's not possible

1270
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,520
but then the answer is also we're all

1271
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,599
individuals we're all people who have

1272
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,119
our own lives who have our own friend

1273
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,720
circles who are going to whatever

1274
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,839
conferences that we enjoy going to

1275
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:32,800
and

1276
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,640
you have to start at some point and

1277
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,280
that's the the big difference between

1278
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
something like micro politics and macro

1279
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,440
politics there is no way for me to

1280
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
change what [ __ ] trump is thinking or

1281
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,520
trying to do

1282
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,240
but on a micro political level there's a

1283
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,079
lot you can do

1284
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,160
the micro politics i think there is this

1285
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,960
uh this idea in history that history is

1286
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,160
only changed by the big man of course

1287
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,520
most of the time in history man

1288
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,280
but it's actually not true

1289
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,880
history is an accumulation

1290
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
of many many small decisions of many

1291
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,359
many many small players and of course

1292
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,400
there are a couple of people like

1293
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,640
napoleon bonaparte or hitler or whoever

1294
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,000
it is or trump uh that have a lot of

1295
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,520
weight

1296
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
in in in the history of the world but

1297
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,319
sometimes that weight is only because it

1298
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,400
ends up in history books and people

1299
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
haven't witnessed what really happened

1300
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
200 years ago or something like that i

1301
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,680
mean i'm not saying that we should

1302
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,599
distrust history books or something that

1303
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,520
not at all yeah then you were in the

1304
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,480
same uh like you know like uh uh country

1305
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,920
conservation camp holocaust denier

1306
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,280
[ __ ] and stuff like that no no i'm

1307
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
not talking about that i'm talking about

1308
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,480
that that

1309
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,280
uh we all have a power that we kind of

1310
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,079
forgot that we have

1311
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,079
and democracy to a certain degree helps

1312
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,400
us forget that power because we all have

1313
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,160
a vote but at the same time we all feel

1314
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,520
so helpless

1315
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,839
and but yeah it's kind of by design

1316
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,319
every four years people ask you what you

1317
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,839
want to vote for and you vote for and

1318
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,440
then something happens

1319
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,680
but most of the time our world is not

1320
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,880
democratic art is not democratic uh the

1321
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,200
workplace is not democratic like

1322
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,440
hardly anything is democratic in our

1323
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,319
world but we have the strange feeling of

1324
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,040
that every four years or every two years

1325
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,599
it is important to say something no you

1326
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,359
have to say something every day

1327
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,440
and i understand as i mentioned before

1328
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,839
there is emotional labor in that and

1329
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,520
it's incredibly hard to do that but

1330
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,839
there's no way

1331
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,040
we're going to change anything if we

1332
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,880
don't if we don't do it so it's

1333
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,119
complicated yeah so

1334
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,880
and if you fight with a jellyfish like

1335
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,119
this uh it's even more complicated

1336
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,000
because

1337
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,640
how is it possible that trump

1338
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,880
who is like one of the most mainstream

1339
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,280
people you can imagine suddenly for many

1340
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
many people on the on the globe not only

1341
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,200
in the us also in austria and germany

1342
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,720
and other places

1343
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,280
is the big underdog he is the underdog

1344
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,599
he is the one who fights the powers he's

1345
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,440
the one who can really change things

1346
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,280
he's the one who fights for all of us no

1347
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,520
he doesn't of course he does not

1348
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,480
so

1349
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,400
just a couple of examples uh that i

1350
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,079
think that are super important that we

1351
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,240
should talk about but

1352
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,640
but but how do we do it for example

1353
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,400
talking about privacy

1354
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,000
i think that privacy is an important

1355
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
matter but privacy is also a very

1356
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,720
bourgeois fantasy

1357
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,800
and it's also very protestant in certain

1358
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,599
in certain elements and and so privacy

1359
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,000
is important we need privacy but there

1360
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,760
are certain ways that we have to sell

1361
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,599
the concept of privacy and the concept

1362
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,160
of privacy should not be sold with

1363
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,319
pretty much like a very conservative

1364
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,880
approach to it and most

1365
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,280
privacy advocates out there have a

1366
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,480
strange

1367
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,680
reactionary almost way of selling why we

1368
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,760
all need privacy

1369
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,119
so

1370
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,720
privacy important yes but but let's try

1371
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,880
to tell people why it's really important

1372
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,440
that you have privacy and not as an

1373
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,880
empty

1374
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,079
vehicle for for for something uh open

1375
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,480
culture yeah really or are we just

1376
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,559
remixing our despair so what can we

1377
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,319
really do to change something like the

1378
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,880
copyright system or whatever we call it

1379
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,000
uh the material side of our world is

1380
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,480
extremely horrible even if we have open

1381
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,480
source software all the [ __ ] that we're

1382
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,119
running is somewhere like dug out in the

1383
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,119
congo in horrific

1384
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,000
conditions and so what can we do of

1385
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,040
course we have to talk about the

1386
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,559
material side of things and if we talk

1387
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,400
about the material side of things then

1388
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,079
we have to talk about capitalism and how

1389
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,440
it's working

1390
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
there's no way besides that otherwise

1391
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,839
we're just like you know remixing our

1392
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,200
despair

1393
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,040
and so what does it mean to be

1394
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,440
subversive in a meaningful way that is

1395
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
pretty much like what i'm talking about

1396
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,559
i don't have an answer to many things uh

1397
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,720
uh there is a little exploit from 20

1398
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,000
years ago i'm not sure do we have some

1399
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,680
time left or is it uh

1400
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,920
we're over we're over okay then then

1401
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,240
let's let's

1402
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,119
so

1403
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,119
uh

1404
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,400
forget it uh

1405
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,240
so

1406
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,440
[Applause]

1407
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,319
so

1408
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,680
i'm not even sure

1409
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,599
it made sense what i told you it's stuff

1410
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,240
that i'm as i said struggling for many

1411
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,559
many years i gave a talk that was

1412
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,960
similar to this one in 2006 and i'm

1413
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,319
still trying to deal with it and i'm

1414
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,839
still trying to adapt my my my models of

1415
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,920
of how to apply this to the real world

1416
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,680
of course i do it in my art in my

1417
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,760
performances and and and all that stuff

1418
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,359
of course i i try

1419
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,720
in my personal

1420
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,040
life to do that i'm not sure i can give

1421
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,160
you any any any wisdom i i don't want to

1422
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
be gandhi here or something like that

1423
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,680
but uh if if i helped uh uh kind of like

1424
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,119

1425
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,839
questions in your mind then i'm totally

1426
