00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
tricks that were used to make them

happen

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
hey i'm going to get started

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
i'm a little anti-social but i'm very

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
excited to be back at hope as my fifth

26
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,759
i'm going to be talking today about the

27
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,200
evolution of online hoaxes and

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,280
propaganda while dissecting the tools

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
and tactics to become the modern weapons

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
of misinformation

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
i'm going to touch briefly on kind of

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
all these things today showing how

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
elements within them are being used

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,759
today to manufacture truth i'll then

35
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,320
show how i used these ingredients to

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
manufacture truth in the run-up to the

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
2017 inauguration i'll explore a hoax

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
that i created that convinced

39
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,080
conservative media to debunk in prime

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
time a conspiracy theory about paid

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
protesters that they themselves had

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
created and were promoting i'll share

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,239
with you the tactics i know putting

44
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
everything on the table the idea is that

45
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
hopefully you can do the same so let's

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
go

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
um so who am i i'm a hacker a software

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,000
engineer amateur animatronics and

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
electronics enthusiast and trans media

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
artist living in the bay area california

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
this is some of the stuff i build it's

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
mostly unsanctioned interactive art in

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,319
unsanctioned places usually for

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
strangers if you ever find yourself

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
going through a storm drain or an

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
abandoned building interacting with

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
robots it might be me

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
this is my first go at manufacturing

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
truth it's a battery powered box i built

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
that can be covertly hidden it makes

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
lifelike knocking sounds at random

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,879
intervals

63
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,560
ghost hunters want to believe that they

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
can communicate with spirits

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
those that have passed um and they

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
believe that some spirits will respond

67
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,560
to them via wrapping you know three

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
knocks for yes two knocks for no uh and

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,560
i wanted to give them the experience

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
that they were seeking

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
um i took my ghost box uh to a place

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
that attracts a lot of ghost hunters in

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
southern california the queen mary this

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
is a luxury cruise liner larger than the

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
titanic that was turned into a

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
stationary hotel and tourist trap and

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
museum in long beach california

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
and this is where i installed it this is

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
a watertight door where a man was

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
purportedly crushed in 1966

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
and then a week after my install i came

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
back for a paranormal conference to

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,239
covertly play with investigators um

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,000
ghost hunters believe that this area

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
specifically is a paranormal vortex

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
um so some academics have given a name

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
to this type of exploration of folklore

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,920
in the real world that these ghost

89
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
hunters are doing and they've called it

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
legend tripping and legend trips are

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
ritual quests in which people strive to

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
explore and find manifest the very

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
events described by supernatural legends

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
so if you've ever gone to a graveyard at

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,439
night like as a teenager with your

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,959
friends to see if like some ghost will

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
appear or maybe you hunted bigfoot

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,400
you're you know you're exploring a

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
legend in the real world um and that's

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,599
called legend tribute i'll come back to

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
this in a moment

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,959
um this is what got me first interested

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
in the world of hoaxes as a kid uh it's

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,480
an email that caused quite a stir

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
amongst many animal lovers

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,160
and it reads for everyone who loves

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
animals a site that we were able to shut

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
down last year has returned we have to

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
try to shut it down again a japanese man

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
in new york breeds and sells kittens

111
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,840
that are called bonsai cats this would

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
sound cute if the kittens weren't put

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
into little boxes after being given

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
muscle relaxants and then locked up for

115
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
the rest of their lives so the idea is

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
that someone is growing kittens in jars

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
and um

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,880
they say you know you got to forward

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,479
this email to 500 people and if you

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,759
click the link in the email you go to

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
this website which has way too much text

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
on it uh it's it's got like a store a

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
phone number uh has instructions on how

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
to put cats into jars um and it just

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
gets really really really silly like

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
it's it's

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
yeah you might ask yourself like who

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
would believe this a lot of people

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
actually believed it including the fbi

130
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
in 2001 the fbi launched an

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
investigation into banzai kitten no this

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
is not a hoax itself

133
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
and they subpoenaed mit to determine the

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
identity of a seemingly obvious hoax

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
website that was being run out of a

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
campus dorm

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
through a press release the article

138
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
quoted the creator

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
as saying i was surprised i really

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
thought that the fbi had better things

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
to do that's your tax dollars at work

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
this is actually one of the better

143
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
things the fbi has done

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
um so uh bonsai kitten is interesting

145
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
because you go from an email to a

146
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
website maybe you call the phone number

147
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
they have a store where you can purchase

148
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,720
jars to put your cats in there's a guest

149
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
book where you can get angry

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
and it like it encompasses all these

151
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
different forms of media to make it more

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,360
convincing and there's a there's a form

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
of art that uses these tactics called

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
trans media storytelling

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
and transmedia storytelling is the

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
practice of designing sharing

157
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
participating in a cohesive story

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
experience across multiple traditional

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,639
and digital delivery platforms for

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
entertainment advertising marketing or

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
social change participants assume the

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
role of hunters and gatherers chasing

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,319
down bits of the story across media

164
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,840
channels comparing notes with each other

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
via online discussion groups and

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,280
collaborating to ensure everybody

167
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
invests time and effort

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
in coming away with a richer experience

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
the first piece of transmedia

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
storytelling online started on bbs's in

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
the 1980s is an experience called aung's

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
hat and it centers on a real ghost town

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,560
in the new jersey pine barrens

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
and it begins with you receiving a xerox

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
catalog of rare books and maybe you

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
found it on a bbs maybe you found a

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
physical copy at one point these were

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,560
being put in visitor centers in the new

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
jersey pine barrens

180
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
and as you read this rare catalog of

181
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
books slowly a story emerges through the

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
curation of the books in this catalog in

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
the books in the catalog don't actually

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
exist

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
but you know one book might be a history

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,479
of ghost towns another one might be a

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
the history of quantum teleportation one

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
might be about a strange psychedelic

189
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,960
ashram in the the pine barrens itself

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
and kind of what emerges through the the

191
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
descriptions of each of these books is a

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,319
narrative about like these renegade

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
princeton professors who had been

194
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,240
conducting quantum physics experiments

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
and chaos theory experiments um and they

196
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
essentially built this dimensional

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,400
travel device called the egg and so

198
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
there were bbs boards of people

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
investigating this there were websites

200
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
of evidence uh people in some cases even

201
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,599
wrote the fictional books themselves um

202
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,120
and this all kind of created an

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
international kind of an interactive

204
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
legend trip in which you could kind of

205
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,720
explore this world that was presented as

206
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
real

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
and the ingredient here i wanted to like

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
really hit on is like you know building

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
an interactive complex world

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
is really important for a convincing

211
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
hoax or legend trip there's a great book

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
written about this i highly highly

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
recommend called legend tripping online

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
uh it's specifically about aung's hat

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
and kind of the birth of transmedia

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
storytelling on the internet

217
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
another early work of transmedia art is

218
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
project neurocam created by robert

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,199
henley an australian performance artist

220
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
in 2004

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
i was actually briefly a participant and

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
a briefly a producing collaborator on

223
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,160
this project

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,840
it starts with a mysterious billboard

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
that like leads you to an odd website of

226
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,000
an organization that like doesn't seem

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,479
to really say anything about itself your

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
only option is to join and if you join

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,840
you get sent on a series of assignments

230
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
that take you out into the real world

231
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,479
have you interacting with other

232
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,840
participants and learning more about

233
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
this organization uh what was

234
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
interesting about this is people who

235
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,840
kind of like played along in this story

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
eventually became producers of the story

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
and created it for other people and it

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
split off into other organizations and

239
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
projects and the ingredient here i think

240
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,440
is like inviting your audience to

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
co-create with you

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
in your kind of story there's a great

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
paper on this i highly highly highly

244
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
recommend uh called the parallaxus a

245
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
game of walking between worlds written

246
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
by jess kilby

247
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
that kind of covers the participant

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
experience the producer experience and

249
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
kind of why she left and the ethical

250
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
reasons behind it

251
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,600
so it wasn't just hoaxers and artists

252
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
who were using these techniques

253
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
companies in the early 2000s started

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
using these to create kind of commercial

255
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
variations often called alternate

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
reality games or args for short as

257
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,839
you'll sometimes hear and these are

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
typically more interactive experiences

259
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
where players are encouraged to solve

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
puzzles together to unlock additional

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,160
layers of the game

262
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
it was collaborative usually commercial

263
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
and goal oriented microsoft made one for

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
steven spielberg's ai and um a company

265
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
called 42 entertainment made one called

266
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,399
i love bees for the launch of halo 2.

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
the uh i love bees one's interesting

268
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
you're on a real like amateur beekeeping

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
website and it's taken over by this like

270
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
ai that needs your help to help like

271
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
reassemble itself and it sends you out

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,600
into the real world by giving you

273
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
coordinates and times and if you go to

274
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,200
the coordinate at that time you find a

275
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
payphone and that phone rings and the ai

276
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
gives you the instructions on how to

277
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
kind of piece it together

278
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
if this sounds familiar uh

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
conspiracy theories kind of like q and

280
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
on uh have a lot in common with

281
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
alternate reality games and transmedia

282
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
storytelling uh basically it's a series

283
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
of secret codes that participants

284
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
decipher together

285
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
participants often feel like the main

286
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,519
character in these stories is they move

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
between media chasing uh pieces of the

288
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
puzzle uh and they're typically told

289
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
across multiple uh platforms in this

290
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
chat in this case 4chan 8chan reddit

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,480
youtube there's even in-person events

292
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
conferences

293
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
it's a really rich

294
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
narrative world unfortunately it's very

295
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,959
harmful

296
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
it was not just hoaxers artists and

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
marketers that started using these

298
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,399
tactics on the internet

299
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
governments got in on the transmedia

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
story telling

301
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
band wagon 2.

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
so on september 11

303
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
2014 the internet research agency

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,160
russia's cyber warfare contractor

305
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
conducted a fascinating virtual

306
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
operation

307
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
so you imagine you're sitting on your

308
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
couch and you get this text message

309
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
toxic fume hazard warning in the area

310
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
until 1 30 pm take shelter check local

311
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
media and columbiachemical.com

312
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,519
columbiachemical.com just happens to be

313
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
the chemical plant down the street from

314
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
you that makes dangerous chemicals so

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
you get on twitter as any normal person

316
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
does

317
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,240
and uh there's like just a flood of

318
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
tweets about people tweeting about this

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
uh this fume the fumes and apparently

320
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
like it was actually an explosion and

321
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
the plant's now on fire and people on

322
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
twitter are posting videos of this

323
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
and they're even linking to cnn which is

324
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
talking about the explosion

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
and this is turning up on youtube and

326
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
then a video pops up on youtube from

327
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
isis claiming responsibility for the

328
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,079
explosion

329
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
this this series of events actually

330
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
happened although the explosion did not

331
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
um and this was kind of a dry run by the

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
internet research agency uh there's two

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,680
papers on this that are really

334
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
interesting um

335
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
they're up there on the screen um the

336
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,279
internet research agency agencies doing

337
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,959
a lot of interesting stuff probably more

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,279
than you know uh don't believe that

339
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
you're not a potential target of them uh

340
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
they're actively fanning the flames of

341
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,760
like every fire in america um so like

342
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
definitely read about them even if you

343
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,639
think you know about them read about

344
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,839
them

345
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,200
this is an interesting thing that i

346
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
found recently uh about a year ago

347
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
actually um

348
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
and it's a it's a mysterious youtube

349
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
channel uh that posts a lot of extremely

350
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,720
professional videos that are

351
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
anti-chinese communist party um and

352
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
they're just so well funded and well

353
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
produced that i was just intrigued by

354
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
this and i couldn't figure out who was

355
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
behind it there was no indication of who

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
was funding this or why they were doing

357
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,800
it

358
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
until a few months ago a donation link

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
appeared and i got really excited so i

360
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
went to donate of course

361
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
and i saw a reference to something

362
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
called the vision times and i'd never

363
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,120
heard of that so i googled it uh the

364
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
vision times is actually a newspaper run

365
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,600
by the religious spiritual movement fong

366
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
gong falun gong

367
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
who's obviously uh persecuted by the

368
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
chinese communist party and suddenly it

369
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
makes sense you know why they would have

370
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
this kind of propaganda channel

371
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,399
they're the same people who do shenyun

372
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
if you've never heard of it god bless

373
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
you that's a good thing

374
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,600
they also run a major conservative

375
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
newspaper here in the u.s called the

376
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
epic times and the epic times is very

377
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
fascinating it's very anti-chinese

378
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,040
communist party and it's very very

379
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,760
pro-trump and they employ the same level

380
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
of professionalism that china insights

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
has

382
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
very very slickly produced stuff

383
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
podcasts videos

384
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
and the most interesting thing about

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
them is they employ this really novel

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,040
tactic

387
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,519
they use farms of mass ai generated

388
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
profiles including computer generated

389
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
photos of people's faces um you know

390
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
potentially even computer generated text

391
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
to spread this content uh the content i

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
recommend uh looking into this the

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
content is incredibly well produced it

394
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
hits on like every emotion uh these guys

395
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
are masters of propaganda and it's worth

396
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
studying uh

397
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
really magical stuff here uh in a bad

398
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
way

399
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
um so we talked about early uh hoaxes

400
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
trans media art alternate reality games

401
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,639
propaganda and kind of how their

402
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,519
ingredients have been used for

403
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
manufacturing truth but i wanted to like

404
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
really concretely show you an example of

405
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
how this can be used even inadvertently

406
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
in the real world to have massive

407
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,639
impacts

408
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
so these are the georgia guidestones

409
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,720
they're built in

410
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,079
1979 they were created by a local

411
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
eccentric who wanted a monument that

412
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
would serve as a guide for humanity

413
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
after a coming great disaster that he

414
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
believed would took place uh so he

415
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
thought that the the you know humanity

416
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
would be wiped out and that they would

417
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
use these guide stones as a way to

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
rebuild it works as a compass a calendar

419
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,959
a clock it's

420
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
unnecessarily complex he's carved 10

421
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,720
commandments on it

422
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
in eight different languages and um

423
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
conspiracy theorists for the last 40

424
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
years have been really

425
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
obsessed with the first three

426
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
commandments

427
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
the first maintain humanity under 500

428
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
million in perpetual balance with nature

429
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
a little creepy guide reproduction

430
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
wisely little creepy unite humanity with

431
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
a new living language that sounds cool

432
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,959
and they believe that

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
and they've told this story through

434
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,680
books uh

435
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,279
and then through documentaries and

436
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,000
movies that this is a plan by a

437
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
luciferian cabal to establish a new

438
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,279
world order who wants to

439
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
depopulate the earth and then i guess

440
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
take control or something and alex jones

441
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,680
has gotten on the bandwagon he's

442
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
produced one of the documentaries

443
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
this thing's 40 years old so like

444
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
there's even early internet websites

445
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
about this

446
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
and most recently people are connecting

447
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,279
covid to the georgia guide stones in

448
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,079
that

449
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
they're saying that the vaccine is how

450
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,839
they're going to depopulate down to 500

451
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,800
million

452
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
and you might think this is silly who

453
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,399
would believe this

454
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,320
this is a candidate for the recent

455
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
republican

456
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
prime uh this is a candidate for

457
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
governor in the recent republican

458
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,519
primary in georgia from may 24th fun

459
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,519
fact she has a phd

460
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,199
this is her website uh her primary uh

461
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,160
her primary kind of campaign platform is

462
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,399
demolishing the guide stones uh she

463
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,639
talks about ridding uh georgia of this

464
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
satanic evil and she makes this pledge

465
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
support my uh fight by contributing as i

466
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,360
and watch as i turn the georgia

467
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
guidestones into dust so 40 years of

468
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
conspiracy have sort of like uh

469
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
culminated into this um you know

470
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,040
a

471
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
person running for governor

472
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
of georgia and this is her campaign ad i

473
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
just have to show it to you because it's

474
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
it's just so bonkers and it kind of puts

475
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
this all together

476
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,518
i'm using sound here

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,040
over 4 billion people have been injected

478
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
with something that took just nine

479
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,279
months to create

480
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
ask yourself why

481
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
back in biblical times human sacrifice

482
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
was a form of demonic worship

483
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,759
we're still doing it

484
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
in present day by killing our unborn

485
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
it's the same demons it's the same

486
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
sacrifice it's the same sin

487
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,519
it's just a different time

488
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
we've watched as people have destroyed

489
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,199
our history and monuments and in their

490
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
place they have erected statutes to

491
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
their own gods

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,399
the new world order is here

493
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,040
and they told us it was coming

494
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
it's a battle far greater than what we

495
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
see in the natural

496
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
it is a war

497
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
between good and evil

498
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
so uh that's from her campaign ad she

499
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
doesn't say what the other executive's

500
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
orders are which i think is interesting

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
on her website um and you might ask

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,839
yourself you know like what could go

503
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
wrong in this alternate reality we've

504
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
created you know this this conspiracy of

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
fiction that's been told for 40 years

506
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,039
between like books documentaries radio

507
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,080
programs

508
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
well this is what happened next also new

509
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
tonight we have our first look at the

510
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
explosion at the georgia guidestones the

511
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
gbi just releasing this video hours ago

512
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
and you can see there is a bright flash

513
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,080
and then part of the structure explodes

514
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
so uh it was like a couple months after

515
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
her failed run at governor uh the

516
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
guidestones were blown up um so you know

517
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
there's real world consequences to 40

518
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,080
years of you know this ridiculous story

519
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,679
so i'm going to talk now about something

520
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,720
that i created using these tactics

521
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,039
that was pretty effective but first i

522
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,640
want to tell you why i created it and it

523
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
starts right here so i was actually at a

524
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,039
fundraiser for a legal defense fund for

525
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
water protectors taking a stand against

526
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
the dakota access pipeline in case you

527
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,559
don't know north dakota's brought like

528
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
800 cases against mostly native peoples

529
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
who are protesting the construction of

530
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
an oil pipeline on their land

531
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,640
and

532
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
the woman running the fundraiser was

533
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
one of the mediators between tribal

534
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
people and law enforcement and she said

535
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
at the end of their first meeting

536
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
the law enforcement was like oh you know

537
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
we're so relieved to know that you're

538
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
real people you know we've been told

539
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
that you were kind of paid here

540
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
paid to be here by environmental groups

541
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,919
and just trying to cause trouble and

542
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
like that comment just like really for

543
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
some reason just like really hurt me

544
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,520
um and i just felt really really sad um

545
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,400
and

546
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,720
i i can't say that i was surprised i

547
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
read conservative media because i want

548
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
to know how to talk to conservatives and

549
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,039
a common trope is uh that you know

550
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,520
the enemies are essentially like paid

551
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,600
agitators or paid protesters this is

552
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,799
something that's like been around for a

553
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,640
while and is someone who's like

554
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,600
literally marched in the streets um

555
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
it's offensive because you know

556
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,960
tens of thousands of people aren't

557
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
marching because they're um being paid

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
they're marching because they're pissed

559
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
off uh the math just doesn't make sense

560
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
um so i asked myself like what would it

561
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
take to debunk the idea of paid

562
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,280
protesters uh and i came up with an idea

563
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
i call the credibility trap and this was

564
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
my plan i would create the thing that

565
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
people believed in a paid protesting

566
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
company i would then get the attention

567
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
and be the only real tangible proof that

568
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
people could point to

569
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
and then it would become silly and

570
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
ridiculous causing those spreading the

571
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,360
information to then have to go correct

572
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
their readers or to put it another way

573
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,280
the idea was to get the media to report

574
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
on something that turned itself slowly

575
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,880
into a ridiculous spectacle to show

576
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,559
people that the topic itself was made up

577
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
and i gave myself two rules for this one

578
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
never give up on the story no matter

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
what never admit it's a lie and two

580
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,400
slowly become more ridiculous and i

581
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
thought those two things would play off

582
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
each other

583
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
so i did when anyone does i started by

584
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
creating an unnecessarily detailed

585
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,760
website uh it was fairly silly the math

586
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,440
of how many people we had on the streets

587
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
didn't make sense it was mostly

588
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,520
believable but it had like weird satanic

589
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
references

590
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,679
um i created an unnecessarily complex

591
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
job application form that asked all

592
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,840
sorts of very detailed questions i made

593
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
a phone line that started with the

594
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
number 666 and created a very

595
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
complicated phone tree i made a

596
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,120
operative login thing so that it seemed

597
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
like people were logging into this site

598
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
or something um and then i just started

599
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
placing job ads as any real company

600
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
would and i targeted the largest

601
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
conservative majority cities uh and

602
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
where i thought i would have a good

603
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
chance of getting attention and i placed

604
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
ads on like backpage indeed

605
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,000
trying to hire paid protesters

606
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
i then also placed google and bing ads

607
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
and i targeted

608
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,799
journalists and news organizations so

609
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
that they could be hired to be paid

610
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
protesters

611
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,520
so at this point i have a website a

612
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
phone number job postings an operative

613
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,559
login i got i'm sending these

614
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
newsletters on a weekly basis i have

615
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
google ads

616
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
and i'm really kind of starting to blend

617
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,000
this together

618
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
i then spent the next couple weeks

619
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
every night posting comments on infowars

620
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
gateway pundit and other conspiracy

621
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
websites 4chan reddit's the donald uh

622
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
and soon it wasn't me posting it was

623
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
other people posting uh and and the

624
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,280
discussion sort of uh got you know

625
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,559
started kicking off in these weird

626
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,400
conspiracy corners and a lot of people

627
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
started coming to the website

628
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,640
um and uh

629
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
people started taking the bait first it

630
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,799
was like small little websites that i'd

631
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
never heard of weird blogs that just

632
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,640
seemed bizarre and then it was like

633
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
mainstream conspiracy blogs uh things

634
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
that a lot of people read that you may

635
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,320
not read

636
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,360
uh spudnik news took it uh newsmax

637
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
started reporting on it and i love this

638
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
quote though reports of paid agitators

639
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,720
have been debunked as fake news demand

640
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,120
protest has a working phone number um so

641
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,320
the bar is very low folks for newsmax um

642
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
and then uh infowars word of story and

643
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
then i think the best one here is the

644
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
washington times after a 30 minute phone

645
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,440
call with me wrote this article

646
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
which you know washington times is like

647
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
an almost respectable conservative

648
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
newspaper um drudge report ran it at the

649
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
top of their uh page um so it was really

650
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
taken off uh and i started getting a lot

651
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,840
of job application

652
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,120
applications which is something that i

653
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
didn't anticipate or think about so i

654
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,559
had to shut that down

655
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,799
that just felt bad i felt

656
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,559
people were actually applying which was

657
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
scary to me and the phone numbers

658
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
started getting flooded with phone calls

659
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
and i just wanted to play just a small

660
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
sampling of them this is a message for

661

demand protest wow

670

i noticed that the first three digits of

671
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
your phone number are 666.

672
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
i just simply cannot believe any

673
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
organization like this exists in the

674
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
united states because you cheapen the

675
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,280
value of protest

676
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
hi

677
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,440
i just called to say that i think you

678
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
people are disgusting

679
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,240
the whole concept of your business i

680
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
can't even believe that some [ __ ]

681
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,080
thought it up and shat it out of their

682
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
ass

683
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
and whoever [ __ ] it is is your boss

684
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
owner

685
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,120
yes this is a real call i hope you do

686
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,360
record these calls

687
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,880
my name's

688
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
i'm not being paid to say that i'm

689
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
outraged at your fake outraged

690
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
protesters

691
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
now why don't you all go snort some coke

692
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
and have an orgy and [ __ ]

693
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
every one of you i took that advice yeah

694
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
here's my message you [ __ ] douchebag

695
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,919
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] [ __ ]

696
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,279
guess who's in charge of your life god

697
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,600
donald trump is the best president ever

698
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,919
you guys are [ __ ] losers

699
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
go die

700
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
um so by this point we were getting a

701
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
lot of attention uh most of it was

702
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
fairly uncritical um but there were some

703
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
exceptions uh there were some small like

704
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,000
local publications that called us out uh

705
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,919
some guy named corey doctro at a website

706
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
called boingboing called us fake he also

707
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,720
spread some misinformation by saying we

708
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,600
had a non-working phone number uh snopes

709
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,679
uh called us unproven which is the most

710
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
charitable thing anyone's ever done they

711
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
also said we're demand progest uh i have

712
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
no more faith in snopes

713
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
um and some actually a couple local news

714
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,000
stations did stories calling us almost a

715
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
hoax trying to give activism a new

716
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,360
bottom line this seems really suspicious

717
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,080
we showed the ad to andrew dobbs program

718
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
director for the texas campaign for the

719
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,159
environment the fifty dollars an hour is

720
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,200
really suspicious the the super super

721
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
suspicious part is that twenty five

722
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
hundred dollar a month retainer as the

723
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
leader of a grassroots nonpartisan group

724
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
dobbs says the numbers are budget

725
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
breakers i don't have any evidence that

726
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
it's not real other than the fact that

727
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,799
it seems

728
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
completely stupid

729
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,320
if the demand protest ad is a ruse it's

730
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,440
an elaborate one to get more information

731
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
i went through an online application

732
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
process that's running in austin and

733
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
more than a dozen other cities

734
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,679
but after submitting the application and

735
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,360
calling the company's san francisco

736
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,400
phone number i've gotten no response i

737
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
think it's kind of interesting ut

738
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
government professor eric mcdaniel

739
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,559
evaluated the ad i think it's most

740
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,799
likely a hoax ad he says

741
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960
so it is a hoax anyways

742
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,640
at this point conservative media was

743
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,720
eating it up um there was some weak

744
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
debunking by non-conservative

745
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
publications but it seemed like the lies

746
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
were getting a lot more coverage than

747
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
the truth um and i was starting to have

748
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
an ethical crisis because i wasn't sure

749
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,520
how i was going to spring my credibility

750
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,320
trap

751
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
and i was starting to wonder if it had

752
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,679
maybe spiraled out of control and i'd

753
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,320
just done a bad thing so at the depth of

754
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,760
my feelings i got this email which was

755
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,559
uh

756
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
from tucker carlson

757
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
and he wanted me to be on his show in

758
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
four hours and i was having a really bad

759
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
day at work uh it was it was like a

760
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,799
really bad day so i was not in a mental

761
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
place to do this so i go on social media

762
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
and i said anyone want to go on tucker

763
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
carlson's show tonight uh you have the

764
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,080
opportunity to say whatever you want and

765
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,440
i knew like i was gonna have one

766
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
opportunity to get ridiculous

767
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
and i was like this is it like this is

768
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
where we have to just have to get

769
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,000
completely unhinged uh and a friend of

770
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
mine uh responded who's a documentary

771
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
filmmaker he'll be in the q a uh via

772
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,320
video here uh we had a quick phone call

773
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,760
and agreed on some ground rules they

774
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
were start by playing the story straight

775
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,480
refuse to acknowledge it's fake ever and

776
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
slowly get more ridiculous and uh this

777
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
is the result this is all improv on his

778
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,880
part he was just fast thinking on his

779
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,080
feet um yeah more on that up ahead but

780
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,440

782
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
friday's inauguration looks like it

783
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,400
could be a protest event for the ages

784
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,080
with thousands of anti-donald trump

785
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,480
agitators descending on the city and why

786
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
wouldn't they advertisements posted more

787
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,880
than 20 cities have been recruiting paid

788
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,360
protesters to come here to dc to help

789

real your website is fake the claims you

804
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,799
have made are lies

805
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
this is a hoax let me start at the

806
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,720
beginning however with your name dom

807
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
talipso which is not your real name

808
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
it's a fake name well he ran you through

809
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
law enforcement level background checks

810
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,559
and that name does not exist so let's

811
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,320
start out with the truth tell me what

812
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,200
your real name is

813
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,880
it's dominic

814
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
to yeep so it's uh

815
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,360
ells are silent that's a lie and you

816
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
know it's a lie and we asked you for id

817
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
at the los angeles bureau and you said

818
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
you didn't have id with you but dallas

819
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
you have a wallet on you every grown man

820
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,279
does hold up a credit card you can cover

821
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,840
the number to our camera and show us any

822
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
piece of documentation with the name

823
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
dominic talipso on it and you can't

824
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
because that's not true

825
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,799
sure sure um absolutely i'll do that in

826
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
just a moment um

827
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
i might just begin with uh kind of

828
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
wondering uh tucker you're not accusing

829
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
this me of being a hoax

830
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,559
are you

831
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,880
i'm saying that your name is fake and

832
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,120
this company is fake and that the claims

833
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
you've made on your website are false

834
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
and so my question for you is why

835
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
is this an effort to discredit the

836
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
protesters at the trump inauguration is

837
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,799
it an effort to convince conservative

838
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,279
news organizations to pick up the story

839
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,480
and therefore highlight their

840
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,039
gullibility what's the point of the ruse

841
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,480
that you're perpetuating on the american

842
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
news media

843
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,720
sure absolutely great questions uh i

844
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
mean

845
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
basically there's no way that a

846
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
legitimate news agency would have

847
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,559
somebody on uh that didn't really know

848
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
what they were saying or was just kind

849
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,200
of talking out of their behinds there's

850
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
a certain amount of vetting that goes on

851
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,080
behind every news organization so i

852
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
would assume that i wouldn't be given

853
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,360
air time on a national stage

854
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
unless i was legitimate

855
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
well i'm vetting you right now and i'm

856
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,039
beginning by saying you are not

857
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,279
legitimate you are lying

858
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,559
we know that

859
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,480
you have fooled other news organizations

860
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,159
you did not fool us

861
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,880
and my question is why are you doing it

862
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,720
and and i guess let me just satisfy our

863
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,840
viewers who may be thinking well maybe

864
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
we're miscalling this on your website

865
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,640
you claim that you pay a retainer to

866
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,960
1817

867
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
operatives

868
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,159
every month now if that were actually

869
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,720
true that's 54 million dollars a year

870
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,960
you're spending just on retainers it's

871
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,799
another 30 million a year if you're

872
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,279
paying them for six hours a week work

873
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
that's demonstrably silly you're not

874
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,679
doing that

875
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,840
no we're actually doing 80 million a

876
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,640
year um so i don't know quite where you

877
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
got those numbers but those are

878
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,120
definitely uh obviously dated um i i i

879
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
do want to mention the fact wait wait so

880
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
hold on

881
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,799
you're not conceding that this is a hoax

882
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,240
you're saying that this is a real

883
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,640
company that's engaged in the activities

884
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
you say it's engaged in that you're

885
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
hiring protesters

886
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,720
you have 1800 of them already on

887
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
retainer for 2500 bucks a month and

888
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
you're affecting american politics by

889
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
doing this

890
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
yeah we actually changed our mind though

891
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,039
about um about we're no longer actually

892
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
going after donald trump we're actually

893
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,880
going after the protesters at the

894
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
inauguration um so we kind of changed

895
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
our minds actually recently and that was

896
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,519
a result mainly of uh the enormous

897
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,120
amount of hate mail that we received

898
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
people you know making death threats and

899
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,799
they they basically just really talked

900
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,399
us into changing our position so what

901
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,679
we're doing now is we're actually

902
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,159
protesting the protesters um okay with

903
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,080
that that actually didn't really

904
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,919
happen because you don't have a physical

905
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,440
address because you don't have a real

906
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,840
office your website was just put up your

907
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,240
facebook page same thing you haven't

908
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,840
been receiving hate mail because you

909
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,120
don't exist okay so if you do exist why

910
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
don't you give me some evidence that

911
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
you're real beginning with your actual

912
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,640
name which is not dominic tilipo and by

913
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
the way your business partner doesn't

914
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,480
exist either so let's just be straight i

915
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,080
mean let's just be real

916
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,960
yeah

917
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,320
what is the real story here why are you

918
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,840
doing this what point are you trying to

919
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
make yeah

920
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
uh the main point basically is that um

921
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,279
we are

922
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,600
greatly greatly supportive of national

923
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,519
treasures such as julian assange edward

924
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,600
snowden peyton manning right and we

925
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,399
really support their efforts to really

926
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,320
get the truth out there and in the case

927
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,519
of the current client that we have right

928
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,799
now

929
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,880
that client is

930
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
very interested in releasing the roswell

931
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,880
papers

932
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,159
i don't know what really so you're

933
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,679
pretty supportive of peyton manning are

934
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,279
you

935
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,679
extremely you know

936
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,399
okay you're not gonna i mean obviously

937
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,240
this is performance art i will say

938
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
you're pretty good at it when you

939
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
convince papers like the washington

940
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,519
times which ran this pretty straight

941
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,240
to run your lies to run this hoax which

942
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
i will concede is kind of amusing

943
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
what was the point of that i mean beyond

944
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
just amusing yourself are you trying to

945
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,360
make a political statement

946
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,200
um i don't know i mean

947
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,919
it's pretty pretty darn easy these days

948
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,600
to just say whatever the heck you want

949
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
on national tv and have it passed off

950
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,039
his truth um yeah and you know uh it's

951
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
pretty uh i don't know it's just pretty

952
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,919
incredible to me how easy it was to get

953
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,240
the coverage we got by the way i'm not

954
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,679
saying any of this is a hoax or any of

955
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,519
this isn't true we've actually got a

956
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,000
hundred thousand protesters going to

957
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
washington dc to fight anybody who is

958
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,720
opposed to donald trump i mean the

959
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
reason we shift another main reason we

960
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,360
shifted uh from being against trump to

961
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,600
trump about 30 minutes ago

962
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,159
was basically we realized initially he

963
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,159
didn't really like

964
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,080
he didn't really like julian assange or

965
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
peyton manning and

966
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,679
when he kind of changed when the

967
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,840
election and the assange connection was

968
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
made

969
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,919
he

970
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,679
essentially became a supporter of

971
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,279
assange and so we are now supporting

972
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,039
trump in the hope that the roswell

973
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,919
documents from 1947 are finally

974
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,840
uh released and put back into the hands

975
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,559
of um fischer stevens the critical

976
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,159
roswell documents all right well give my

977
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,440

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,918
is the channel that's spreading this

1003
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,000
[ __ ] so that was the trap hopefully

1004
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,760
some people learned uh even like

1005
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,440
extremist conservative websites like

1006
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
gateway pundit ran articles uh praising

1007
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
tucker for exposing the hoax i love this

1008
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
quote carlson his team did significant

1009
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
research into mr talipso and exposed him

1010
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,800
on the show as being a complete fraud

1011
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
this was their original article so i

1012
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,960
wouldn't applaud them too much

1013
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,359
and the washington times just silently

1014
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,359
altered their article saying it was a

1015
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,960
hoax after the fact

1016
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,680
which

1017
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,119
is kind of sneaky but if you go to the

1018
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,480
wayback machine you can see that they

1019
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,280
lie

1020
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
a number of legitimate publications

1021
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
wrote interesting articles about this

1022
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,520
the washington times one's kind of cool

1023
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,839
my favorite is this spin magazine

1024
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,880
article uh coolest journalist ever

1025
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
so i thought like okay maybe this worked

1026
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
like maybe some people got this message

1027
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
maybe i've dispelled it for maybe i

1028
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,520
don't know

1029
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
20 percent of people um and then i saw

1030
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,040
this tweet

1031
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
this is from ari fleischer the white

1032
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,640
house press secretary for george w bush

1033
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,839
a month after this he tweets uh outraged

1034
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,160
at demand protest so uh people are still

1035
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,560
being fooled unfortunately um i don't

1036
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
know if this was a good thing i'm not

1037
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
doing political stuff anymore back to

1038
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
paranormal

1039
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
so anyways uh if you want to do this

1040
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,480
sort of thing i have some advice have a

1041
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
message that confirms beliefs or targets

1042
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
an emotional trigger

1043
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,839
mystery creates intrigue leave your

1044
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,320
motivations up to interpretation

1045
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,560
study transmedia storytelling tactics to

1046
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,640
create an alternate reality

1047
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,720
and seed your ideas in small communities

1048
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
of your ideal audience and then kind of

1049
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
grow from there some great books on this

1050
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
legend tripping online i talked about

1051
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,079
earlier uh trust me i'm lying from the

1052
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
former marketing director of american

1053
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,160
apparel very great book on media

1054
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
manipulation he lays out all his tactics

1055
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
and magic and showmanship uh it has a

1056
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
lot of great kind of it's for magicians

1057
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
but it has a lot of great tips and sort

1058
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,599
of like presentation and attention uh

1059
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,839
what can we do to maybe uh combat

1060
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,000
manufactured truth um this is just my

1061
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
two cents i think immerse yourself in

1062
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
communities filled with views you oppose

1063
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
i read conservative news every day

1064
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
because i want to know how to talk to

1065
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
conservatives

1066
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
i think if you if you hate a group of

1067
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
people you should read about them should

1068
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,079
consume the media they're consuming so

1069
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,599
you can speak to them and understand

1070
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,040
where they're coming from we also need

1071
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
to i think vocally challenge the

1072
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,079
veracity of unsourced claims this is

1073
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,680
really unfun and makes you unpopular

1074
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
sometimes

1075
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
but if we don't do that we're kind of

1076
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
screwed

1077
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
collectively i think we need to fund

1078
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,079
free public news media that is

1079
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,000
accessible and engaging the new york

1080
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
times costs like a hundred dollars a

1081
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,359
year the truth can't cost a hundred

1082
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,920
dollars a year um npr is great i love

1083
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,359
terry gross although she doesn't fact

1084
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,520
check fresh air is wonderful but it's

1085
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
not accessible and engaging to most of

1086
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,440
america we need to do a better job here

1087
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,200
pre-bunking or we need to build trust

1088
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,720
ahead of those that might manufacture

1089
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,599
doubt

1090
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,800
so that they're prepared for those

1091
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,920
messages

1092
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
and this is going to be controversial

1093
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
but i think when possible avoid forms of

1094
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
censorship that will end up pushing

1095
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
those censored into extremist echo

1096
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
chambers like parlor truth social and

1097
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,880
gab go check out those networks those

1098
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,079
are where the people who are banned from

1099
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
twitter go they they pick up all sorts

1100
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,359
of new things uh it's a real problem i

1101
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,720
don't have an answer but it's it's

1102
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
terrifying to see this happen

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,440
italian restaurant with tucker carlson

1166
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
and i'm like this is so

1167
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,079
surreal um but one thing i did before

1168
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,680
that that i thought was really important

1169
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,400
is he did ask for my id

1170
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
and i'm sorry i don't have it pulled up

1171
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,240
or ready to share with everyone but you

1172
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,680
know during the interview asked for my

1173
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,119
id so i did uh you know

1174
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,000
i went

1175
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
right before that spent five minutes

1176
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,800
photoshopping my dump to eepso id

1177
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,440
and uh first thing i did was when i

1178
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,359
walked up uh was

1179
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,520
uh hi i think i'm supposed to be here

1180
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,240
here's my id and shared it with them and

1181
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,280
you know

1182
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
i don't want to make

1183
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,520
i it's not my job or my desire in any

1184
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,280
way to make tugger carlsen laugh or

1185
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
anything but i have always felt that

1186
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,520
like a laughing jury never convicts uh

1187
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
kind of thing and if you can get

1188
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
somebody smiling if you can get somebody

1189
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,359
laughing their guard drops it's just a

1190
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,200
vulnerability so

1191
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
he he thought that was hilarious and

1192
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,119
then literally we just spent the uh the

1193
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,200
next like two and a half hours talking

1194
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,399
about the grateful dead

1195
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
that's it i'm not kidding like we didn't

1196
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,280
talk about anything political at all um

1197
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
and maybe i should have but what am i

1198
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,599
gonna do tell them to stop being

1199
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,560
a terrible person like i don't that's

1200
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
not my job you know so we just talked

1201
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,520
about how you know we both had uh

1202
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,040
deep love for grateful dead which is

1203
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,640
also weird because it isn't like ann

1204
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,400
coulter also super into the grateful

1205
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,800
dead i don't know but um there's a weird

1206
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,240
like

1207
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,400
and well i don't want to get political

1208
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,079
but anyway that i hope that answered

1209
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,040
your question a little bit

1210
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,040
uh whoever's at the mic yeah so i just

1211
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,720
wondered if you heard about an artwork

1212
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
that is i think just opened in mexico

1213
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
city by a couple of conceptual artists

1214
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,280
joshua okun and juan obando

1215
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,599
they actually found a company that does

1216
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,040
pay

1217
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,400
protesters

1218
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
and they made an artwork

1219
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
in a museum where they paid these people

1220
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,160
to have a sort of uh

1221
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,560
bogus like insignia or something like

1222
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,839
that and then they created as a sort of

1223
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,000
video installation i just

1224
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,079
it shocked me

1225
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
seeing this here because i they were

1226
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,319
telling me that these companies really

1227
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,079
do exist and i wondered if you'd heard

1228
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,400
of those companies the real ones yeah so

1229
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,599
um

1230
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,200
there are companies that you can hire

1231
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
for like crowds on movie sets in fact

1232
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
it's rumored that trump hired

1233
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,599
one of these crowds for his announcement

1234
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,720
for uh presidency um

1235
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,480
they are not hiring people on the scale

1236
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,160
of tens of thousands of people marching

1237
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,440
in the streets against trump that's

1238
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
ridiculous that's a lot of money

1239
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
no one has that kind of money and can

1240
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,160
keep that kind of secret um so uh yeah

1241
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
there are you know there are people who

1242
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,079
will fill out movie sets um i get a lot

1243
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
of emails to the demand protest account

1244
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,319
of people wanting to actually hire me

1245
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,000
which is kind of terrifying i've thought

1246
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,680
about maybe publishing who those people

1247
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,560
are

1248
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,200
um but yeah so there is a if someone

1249
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,880
wants to start an incredibly unethical

1250
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,119
business there is like on a small scale

1251
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,000
um

1252
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,359
people who are trying to do that but

1253
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,680
certainly not like at a nationwide scale

1254
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,520
um people are actually pissed off

1255
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,119
ah makes sense

1256
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,040
well hey we we talked about propaganda

1257
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,480
and how or

1258
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
basically just fooling people and in the

1259
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,079
matrix chat they're asking if you have

1260
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,000
any recommendations to teach others

1261
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,240
especially those who are younger how to

1262
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,920
defend against falling for that

1263
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,599
disinformation

1264
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,720
i think it's um probably about going to

1265
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,119
original sources

1266
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,079
which is getting more expensive to do

1267
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,280
i think

1268
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
it probably

1269
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,160
probably depends on the piece of

1270
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,839
information but

1271
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,040
you know making sure that the website

1272
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,440
you're going to is is one that is

1273
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,760
remotely credible uh it's an you know an

1274
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,880
actual news organization that's

1275
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,280
hopefully been around for a while and is

1276
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,720
known

1277
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,079
i'm not the best person to answer this

1278
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,520
but um

1279
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,960
yeah you have to research everything

1280
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,920
individually i don't think there's like

1281
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,400
a blanket answer

1282
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,160
cool

1283
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,319
anyone else have any other questions

1284
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,240
all right well hey thanks for the talk

1285
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,598
that was great thanks so much

1286
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,499
[Applause]

1287
00:44:49,290 --> 00:45:00,710
