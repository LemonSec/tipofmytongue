24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
some hf and some experimentation

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,680
day

41
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
can everyone hear me all right good

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,199
all right all right well hey thanks uh

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
everybody for uh making it out today uh

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
joe and myself will be doing a little

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
bit of a back and forth type of

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
presentation uh because we're covering

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
lots of interesting things around open

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
source rf experimentation so just to

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
kind of set the stage for what we will

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
and will not be covering this is not

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
going to be a super in-depth

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
presentation i don't want to see anyone

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
falling asleep so i promise you we'll

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
keep it pretty light um we're not going

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
to try to convert you into the ham radio

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
cult that andrew talked about so if

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
that's not of interest

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
that's not the goal of this uh we're

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
also not going to promote any gray areas

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,599
as it relates to playing around with the

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
radio we want to keep this highly

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
ethical and above

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
uh you're going to learn some

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
interesting tips and tricks

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
we're going to explore quite a lot of

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
different things to help you better

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,920
understand the rf world around you and

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
most importantly we're going to be

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,360
highlighting how you blend software and

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
hardware together as it relates to open

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,200
source excitement

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
so a little bit about myself uh this is

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
my first time at a hope conference uh

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,040
recently i had an article published in

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
2600 on l-band satellite so if anyone

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
remembers that two issues ago

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
that was me uh hackaday also seems to

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,680
like picking up some of my articles

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
that i post on one of the ham radio

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
clubs that i started called hudson

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,159
valley digital network so

82
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,720
there's lots of great content there uh

83
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,000
i've been playing around with radio

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
stuff since i was a little kid

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
uh played ham radio for a larger part of

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
my entire life which is strange that i'm

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
almost going on 25 years in this hobby

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
which most people in this

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
hobby tend to be a lot older than me so

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
that's kind of interesting i spent a lot

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,159
of my day job focused on research and

92
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
advisory doing lots of cool stuff i try

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,439
not to

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
to blur the lines between hobby and

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
everything else and so that's a little

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920
bit about me and again joe and myself

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,439
will be kind of flip-flopping between

98
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,359
various points of the slides here today

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
good morning everyone good to see you so

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,599
hi i'm joe and e2z and you also might

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,918
know me on rsu's baldrick i've been

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,238
doing amateur radio for longer than i

103
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
care to admit so probably by the time i

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
got licensed that's when i had to do cw

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
um a little bit

106
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
doing cyber security forever for as far

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,759
as a career

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
and probably is an origin story as far

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
as within wireless mesh i was involved

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,919
with many years ago in that regards so

111
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,360
and then first hope it was hope six

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
for the amateur radio activities was

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
starting to get together around that

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
time and probably about maybe hope 10 we

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
started getting into having an amateur

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
radio repeater at hotel pennsylvania so

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,000
there's been a lot of people over the

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
years been involved in all the amateur

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
radio activity around here and just a

120
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,919
shout out to all of them so really

121
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,040
looking forward to this with you and

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,759
thank you very much

123
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
your next slide

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,759
of course

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,840
so again we're going to talk about you

126
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
know a couple everything's pretty much

127
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
open source from open source hardware

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
and open source software

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,759
and again

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
this is what really the community has

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
really been driving some of the

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,199
innovations in amateur radio lately and

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
also in our radio as a whole so we're

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
going to be bouncing back and forth

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,639
between projects that are open for

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,800
purely open source hardware as well as

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
ones are just open source software open

138
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,560
source software initiative and there's

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,919
been a combination of things a good

140
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,440
synergy that's been uh going on

141
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
all right so as uh like joe said we're

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
going to bounce around there's lots of

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
interesting open source projects some

144
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
are very focused just on hardware others

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
are on software but there's a few that

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,800
we highlight that actually look at uh at

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,039
both at various levels and so i'm not

148
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,560
going to kind of go through all the

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
little bullets on here everyone could uh

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
kind of take a read here but some of the

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
things that we'll be uh running through

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
today uh maybe just with a quick show of

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
hands anyone familiar with hacker ref

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
all right excellent so we got a lot of

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
people there how about m17 is that

156
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
something familiar to people cool uh how

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
about you bid x any uh ham radio people

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
uh playing that cool a couple not too

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
many um how about a project i'm sure

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
there's not many people that have ever

161
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
heard of haz violet but

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
good we're

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
hopefully going to change that today

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
how about software like sdr angel anyone

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
familiar with that

166
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
good that'll be exciting uh how about

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
open rtx if you're m17 that might be

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
familiar a couple people uh sigpai and

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
has violet again probably not familiar

170
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
but these are some things that joe and i

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,880
have worked on together and so we'll

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
share a little bit more about that so

173
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,039
before we talk about hacker f and why is

174
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
it one of the best and often imitated

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,280
for those that are not familiar sdr or

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
software defined radio it's very very

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,039
different than

178
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,440
traditional rf design and so the block

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
diagram here is if you were a kid in

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
like the 1950s and you're building stuff

181
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
these were kind of the functional blocks

182
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
that you have and it was very hardware

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
focused you know once you kind of built

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
it that's what you were going to expect

185
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
if you wanted to modify things that

186
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,160
meant that you had to do so with

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
hardware maybe swapping out some

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
capacitors resistors changing tubes

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
updating an ic etcetera so software

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
defined radio is very different where

191
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,919
within that architecture you still have

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,680
a lot of the same functional blocks like

193
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
the rf front end which is where you do

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,599
some uh some pre-analysis of inbound or

195
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
outbound signals but the majority of

196
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
everything is done in the software so

197
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
with one sdr radio like the hacker f

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
that we're going to be chatting about

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,639
for the next couple of minutes um

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,080
everything that you could ever envision

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
that you want to do with radio it's just

202
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
basically that's where you kind of spend

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
some time uh with your uh your software

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
so it's quite different than traditional

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,240
radio and this is uh you know been

206
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
around you know for at least 10 plus

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
years but i think now it's kind of like

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
a de facto of most people know what sdr

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,680
is

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
so

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
just to kind of do a quick comparison

212
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
hacker f that was what i would say is

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
probably what really was the first

214
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
low-cost transmit and receive capable

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
software-defined radio uh many of you

216
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
might have one of these or with the

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
hacker f porta pack uh michael osmond uh

218
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
is like one of my heroes and so he's

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
done lots of cool things

220
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,039
for various hobbies uh there's an open

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
source version of this called the

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
hackerref blue which is

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,919
what i have photo and have one up today

224
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,399
so what is it it's a semi duplex

225
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
software defined low power transceiver

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
semi duplex meaning you can transmit and

227
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
receive not at the same time

228
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,959
um what you can do pretty much anything

229
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
that you want uh in the case of the

230
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
hacker ref the original it'll go up to

231
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
six gigahertz the hacker f blue which is

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
the open source slightly lower cost

233
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
version i'm not going to say it's worth

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
anything over a thousand megahertz but

235
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,399
again there's lots of things that you

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
can do within that bandwidth and most

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
importantly again it's the one what i

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
like to highlight because it was one of

239
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,880
the first uh low-cost sdrs that did

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
transmit and receive

241
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
so i think before people if you're not

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
familiar with sdr you don't have a

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
hacker f and you're thinking okay this

244
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,839
sounds like an interesting thing to

245
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,880
experiment

246
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
i don't wanna say go and spend like four

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
or five hundred dollars on something or

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
two hundred dollars uh you might want to

249
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
look at one of the less expensive

250
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
receive only uh software-defined radios

251
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
there's what's called the rtl sdr uh

252
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
it's a popular blog they make their own

253
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
i would suggest picking one of those up

254
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,519
they're around forty dollars you can

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
have a lot of fun you can do lots of

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
interesting things with that and we'll

257
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
kind of talk about that a little bit

258
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
later there's also a much smaller

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
similar feature set called the uh the

260
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
new elect nano uh if anyone's looking

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
for like covert monitoring if you want

262
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
to kind of spire in your neighbors

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,080
neighbor's

264
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,839
weather sensors or next time that you're

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
transiting in an airport might be

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,959
interesting to see some of the different

267
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
signals that are floating around i'm not

268
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
going to say that i've done that myself

269
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,120
but i have some experience with that

270
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
there's also a device called the lime

271
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
sdr mini which is also a transmit

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
receive capable device it is full duplex

273
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
which is rather interesting it's a lot

274
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
smaller

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
um and they have a new version of this

276
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
and so this you might also want to

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
consider as another toy um

278
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,640
the benefit of getting also a receive

279
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
only device is if you have a hacker off

280
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
and you want to receive the stuff that

281
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
you may decide to transmit with

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
spending another 400 on an expensive

283
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
hacker f might not be the best way to

284
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
spend your money go and get a cheap sdr

285
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
to play with it again there's lots of

286
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,480
different things you can do if anyone

287
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
has like one of these little gli uh

288
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,200
pocket routers you can connect an sdr to

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
that and stream things over it so rather

290
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
than tie up your computer you can do

291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
basic things there

292
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
there's just there's a lot

293
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
so the hackerref i think if you go and

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
do a google search if you're not

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
familiar with it there's a lot that

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
you're going to find and i like

297
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
highlighting this because it is a an

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,279
open source piece of hardware

299
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
everything's documented on github

300
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
there's lots of great material out there

301
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
so

302
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,079
definitely feel free to check that out

303
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
now kind of jumping to something

304
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
kind of totally different but let's say

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
for example you have one of these hacker

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
f devices and you're trying to think

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
well what do you want to do with it

308
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
most of the signals that are floating

309
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
around out there excluding analog voice

310
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
and other kind of telemetry things like

311
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
aprs or packet or things like that

312
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
there's lots of digital signals and

313
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,959
you'll just hear kind of you know burt

314
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
and bbb you know just you know you don't

315
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
know what those are by your ear um many

316
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
of those happen to be proprietary if you

317
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,519
want to experiment if you're interested

318
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
in amateur radio there's a new um mode

319
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
called m17 and there's a couple people

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
floating around here today that are uh

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
more tightly linked into that project

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
than myself

323
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
but it's something that's really

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
interesting really innovative it's been

325
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
out for a few years and this is one of

326
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
these things that really kind of blurs

327
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
the lines of what joe and i are going to

328
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
talk about today as it relates to the

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
combination of hardware and software

330
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
from an open source perspective and so

331
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,839
there are some open source designs for

332
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
the m17 project that uh wash his amateur

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
radio call sign in poland is sp5wp

334
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,839
he's the guy who came up with this and

335
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,279
then he has a whole horde of followers

336
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
that help him kind of try to figure out

337
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,399
how to conquer the world so it's

338
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
something really interesting i'd highly

339
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
suggest people to take a look at it

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
we're going to do some experimentation

341
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,399
in the rf village here so if you want to

342
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
learn a little bit more feel free to

343
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
stop by a little bit later today

344
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,120
there's a lot of cool partnerships that

345
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
m17 also has at bottom right

346
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
there's a logo for the amateur radio

347
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,959
relay league that's the leading advocate

348
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,279
in the united states regarding amateur

349
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
radio and my friend ed into xdd who's

350
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,079
probably somewhere out there

351
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,160
he recently received an award on behalf

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,480
of the larger team and so it's good to

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
see that there's advocacy groups looking

354
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,639
at open source and trying to figure out

355
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
how to not only work with them but also

356
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
wider parts of like the hacker and maker

357
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,040
and wider open source community so

358
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
that's a little bit about m17 and we'll

359
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
talk about this

360
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
in context of some of the software that

361
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
joe and i are going to jump into so with

362
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,560
that we're going to go to something a

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
little different that joe's going to

364
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,639
talk to similar software-defined radio

365
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
but a totally different application and

366
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,519
totally different spectrum so

367
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,600
so what's interesting as far as in the

368
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
kits have been coming out as far as um

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,279
amateur radio transceivers ubidex is a

370
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
popular project came out of india for

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,920
about a hundred dollars you could build

372
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,639
a software controlled transceiver the

373
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,320
reason i'm saying software controlled is

374
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
because when you saw that earlier

375
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
diagram that steve provided with you

376
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,240
where you see software defined for every

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,480
elements or processing signal and some

378
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,800
of these kits are running into anymore

379
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
what they're doing is they're blending a

380
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
lot of the analog and making sure that

381
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
just the oscillators are actually being

382
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,079
software controlled so you might have an

383
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,600
oscillator typically from adafruit

384
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,880
si5351 all the oscillators are actually

385
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,959
being controlled by arduino and the

386
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
arduino at the end of the day is

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
actually going ahead and going ahead and

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
updating the displays accordingly but um

389
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
this was pretty much probably the one of

390
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
the first transceivers to sort of break

391
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
the ice as it were for cheaper and

392
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
cheaper transceivers are coming out a

393
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,639
lot of people have been buying these

394
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
transceivers as far as playing around

395
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
for for digital modes in in amateur

396
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,839
radio

397
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,040
and um

398
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
there's a couple of versions it's up to

399
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
version six um one the original versions

400
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
had just lcds but the newer versions are

401
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,720
actually bringing next in displays and

402
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,000
everything is all pretty much

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,639
pre-programmed from um from the person

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
who distributes it again you can find

405
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,880
this online from

406
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,959
looking for ubidex and you can order

407
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
that and as far as a kit

408
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
the assembly there's very little

409
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
soldering all you're doing is soldering

410
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,279
connectors that come off the board

411
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
itself you're not this board itself as

412
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
you see the kit here it comes exactly as

413
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,760
you see it it's already pre-populated in

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
fact the uh

415
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
case that they actually shipped the

416
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,639
basic kit and you could probably use the

417
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,040
plastic case as the enclosure for it in

418
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
itself

419
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
i got a um

420
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
a video of this is one that i've

421
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
actually assembled this is the original

422
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,120
version with the lcd

423
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,199
and uh again yellow but i know steve

424
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,639
likes to get a little laughed anytime we

425
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
turn on 80 meters and uh and hf because

426
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,480
it's

427
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
always very interesting conversations

428
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
going on there so let me see if this

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
will come through

430
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
okay well the audio is not coming

431
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
through on it but that's okay so

432
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,399
again it's very simple oh there you go

433
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
if you go up to 3.8 megahertz you tend

434
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,959
to hear some very interesting

435
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
conversations of

436
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,720
sometimes political whatever but at the

437
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
end of the day this is for the lcd

438
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
disgrace very simple but the newer

439
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
versions actually have a next-in display

440
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
that uh actually show you and um this uh

441
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,519
when i get into a future slide here but

442
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,800
this is what that radio looks like

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
opened up

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,480
um that vertical board you see there

445
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,800
that's the ld lcd display and the

446
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
arduino the arduinos in that part

447
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
actually they call it a rad we know from

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,160
the

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
x folks because it comes already

450
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
pre-programmed and then that just

451
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,759
literally just plugs right into that

452
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,839
board there so any of the soldering you

453
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
see i had to do is really to the

454
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,079
left-hand side of that um

455
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,320
left-hand side of that screen there for

456
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
all the interface capabilities and then

457
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
you know everything else on the front

458
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
end is pretty much mostly connected

459
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
parts so and give you a high level of

460
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
views to a lot of these kits anymore

461
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
if you look from the top down again you

462
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,399
have the the nxt in display itself where

463
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
actually is a computer itself to be

464
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
programmed and you actually have the

465
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
rotary encoder and that all goes down to

466
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,079
the micro controller itself but you see

467
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,160
from the microcontroller from a software

468
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,240
controlled all it's doing is controlling

469
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
the opera the the oscillators

470
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
and the filters

471
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,079
that it needs to select free

472
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
for the proper bands a lot of the rest

473
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
of this is still analog in this kit and

474
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,439
again you're going to see a lot of kits

475
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
that way and that's how they tend to

476
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,439
keep the costs pretty much low in that

477
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
regard and then for the next dm displays

478
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
what's great about them is

479
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,359
there's the windows application that

480
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
next-gen has that you can go ahead and

481
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,199
recreate and reprogram this display any

482
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
way you want so there's a lot of

483
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
programmability and development you can

484
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
so you know there's um there's a site

485
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
called hvdn.org hudson valley digital

486
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
network steve runs hudson valley digital

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,440
network we actually post a number of

488
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
articles on it and if anyone's familiar

489
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
with something called the icom 705 it's

490
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
supposed to be a low power qrp

491
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
transceiver i've been trying to come

492
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
across a way of doing a poor man's um a

493
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,400
poor man's version of that so that's

494
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
about a bit for ubidex

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
another project we were mentioning about

496
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,080
before

497
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
is we're talking about haswirelet so

498
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
this again was another hudson valley

499
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
digital network project

500
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
what we're trying to identify is

501
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
between the maker the hacker community

502
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
and amateur radio identify a way of

503
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
getting better people better uh educated

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
and communications and options are out

505
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,039
there

506
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,720
so we came up with the project of has

507
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,559
violet you know the hardware the antenna

508
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,919
and the software that's where the house

509
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
part comes from

510
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
and this is actually using lower

511
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
technology in fact we actually have um

512
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
if you go to the link we have all the

513
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
information putting this together from

514
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
the hardware to the software um pretty

515
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
much we have a list of the kit from

516
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,160
adafruit which is tip which really is

517
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
this little thing right here all it is

518
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
is a raspberry pi zero with a hat on it

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
that's got the uh laura rf module on it

520
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
with a little miniature oled display a

521
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
couple buttons

522
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
and all together you know

523
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,799
depending on how much you can pay for

524
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
raspberry pi zero anywhere you can get

525
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
them sort of like you know

526
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
what they're supposed to be

527
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
you can go all this for maybe about you

528
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
know 100 bucks or less but you can

529
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,400
actually get some pretty serious

530
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,840
distance out of it

531
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
so that was part of the project we were

532
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
trying to do for for 900 megahertz we

533
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
were pretty much focusing mostly on

534
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
digital

535
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
um again we have a whole get up repo and

536
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
everything that's up for that

537
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
and you can actually get some serious

538
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
distance on laura so what i'm going to

539
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,799
show to you next is a demonstration

540
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,160
where you're seeing a map here is this

541
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,440
is the the

542
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
hudson river valley just about 50 miles

543
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
north where you know the area we live in

544
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
we actually did some communication

545
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
connectivity with these things across

546
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
about you know mile and a half of the

547
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
river and we're only doing like

548
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
milliwatts and we even had these on low

549
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,240
power setting so give you an eye

550
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
idea never mind just giving that map

551
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
and we're going for a check free

552
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,919
distance across the hudson river to the

553
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,799
left newburgh new york where i'm at nd2z

554
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
and across the river and the bottom

555
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,559
toward the bottom right in that park is

556
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
where steve k2 gog

557
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
and joe and when jta are at i think

558
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
that's the pete seeger park it's best

559
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,840
known

560
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
right now that's where i'm tracking it

561
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
from

562
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
i have both

563
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,240
two machines all two uh hasbro pies are

564
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
transmitting right now one's an e2z50

565
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
and the other is purple 60.

566
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
i think any 2z50 is the one that's using

567
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
an omni

568
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
and the purples using the has violet

569
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
antenna

570
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
and again i'll show you what that looks

571
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
like you see that on a map

572
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,120
it's actually here

573
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
where we're looking across the hudson

574
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,280
and they are approximately over

575
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
in that

576
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
general direction

577
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
and the pies themselves are transmitting

578
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
are right here

579
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
so you have right within with the has

580
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
violent antenna itself

581
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
you got um

582
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,360
i think i said before purple

583
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,399
and you got ne2z

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
and dylan has a ground playing with the

585
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,159
omni pretty much have that all set up

586
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,039
just go into a regular power strip

587
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,760
and some regular pi power packs 2.5 amp

588
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,799
each plugged into the power right there

589
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
there's a setup

590
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
and the sunny

591
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
hudson river in the majestic

592
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
hudson valley

593
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,159
yeah down that passes west point so we

594
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,000
got i got a direct line of sight to

595
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
whatever is going on over there so it's

596
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,159
interesting but anyhow the antenna you

597
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
hear me show mention that's a design by

598
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
steve which um steve can comment a

599
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
little bit it was actually a you know a

600
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
pen and a couple of rods he's designed

601
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
to make sure pretty much i had a good

602
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
directional connectivity but we had some

603
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
really we had solid connection back and

604
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
forth we had uh

605
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
i was surprised we just fired him up and

606
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
connected right away and we realized we

607
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
were on the lowest power settings for

608
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,799
these uh for the lora devices

609
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
and we actually went one step further

610
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,600
rather than just doing the pi zero we're

611
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
actually doing this on esp32 also on the

612
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
same repo

613
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
and again some really good results um

614
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,000
what we've also been coming up with for

615
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
these little devices is if anyone really

616
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,480
knows an amateur 80 community fox hunts

617
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
where you're looking for a

618
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
hiding of looking for a hidden

619
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
transmitter so we actually put together

620
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
a project we're referring to as hasduck

621
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,840
where we actually make it that this is

622
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,679
not just a dumb transmitter send

623
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,200
something out actually you can connect

624
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
other sensors to it and based upon its

625
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
environment if it knows it's being

626
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
encroached upon try to be a little bit

627
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
devious about how it's sending signals

628
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,360
out

629
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
so

630
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,520
so that's on the has violet project

631
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
so going back to you know

632
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
one of the favorite uh applications that

633
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
steve likes to work with is sdr angel we

634
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
were getting down to the path of looking

635
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,919
at what are some of the uh distros out

636
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,200
there that support

637
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,320
software defined radio so when i look at

638
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,159
across the landscape one of the ones

639
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,760
you'll see talked about a lot especially

640
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
for the rf hacking our village

641
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
especially for devcon is pentu so if you

642
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
ever go to the rf village out in defcon

643
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,799
and participate in any of the hacking

644
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,039
challenges um they give you tons of

645
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,559
support if you're using the pen tool

646
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
which is built for just that

647
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
another good um distribution we've seen

648
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
out there is a

649
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
is a dragon os and actually if you go on

650
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
youtube it produces a lot of videos on

651
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,799
the use of that dragon os for

652
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
doing a whole bunch of sdr routines and

653
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,679
some of the latest modes

654
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,000
it's been pretty much those two distros

655
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
are pretty much leading what we've been

656
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
we're seeing out there

657
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
and sig pi is a project we've put

658
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,679
together

659
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,600
we were looking at all the distros that

660
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,720
were going out there for software

661
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
defined radio and one thing we would

662
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
realize is

663
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
they don't really stay really current on

664
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,000
the latest packages such as sdr angel we

665
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
will find it that maybe there are a

666
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,120
whole version behind a couple versions

667
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,159
behind and again we know sdr ngo

668
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,360
releases

669
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,320
um

670
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
updates pretty frequently but we decided

671
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,480
to try to go down the path of how we can

672
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
go sort of some somewhat package based

673
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
so sig pi is designed to rise run on

674
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
raspberry pi um threes and fours as well

675
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,279
as um running on a boot as a whole and

676
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,960
it's all package based and we encourage

677
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,279
you to give it a try we focus on signals

678
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,760
intelligence first in amateur radio

679
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
pretty much second and then what you'll

680
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,159
see is build a pie is

681
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,840
one the more in the amateur radio

682
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,960
community they've a lot of them have

683
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,039
pretty much gravitated at as far as

684
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,559
trying to build your disc show to what

685
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,720
you need for your amateur radio needs

686
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,240
and then when you go after open source

687
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
the next biggest thing tends to be

688
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
there's a commercial thing called rig pi

689
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
which includes the hardware

690
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
but when you look at the cost of a few

691
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
hundred dollars through this rig pi box

692
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
hardware and software and everything

693
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,080
else you're like there's a lot of

694
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,679
markup and build up in it but there's

695
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
also a bunch of support i'm just

696
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
mentioning it just for as a comparison

697
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
of the next nearest thing you run into

698
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
uh potentially commercially

699
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,679
steve

700
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,200
all right thanks joe

701
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,679
um so you know we're we're jumping

702
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,360
around you know what we're trying to

703
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
encourage is uh anyone to come visit us

704
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
in the rf village along with all of our

705
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
other ham radio cult type of friends to

706
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,919
learn about some of this latest and

707
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,320
greatest stuff it's really hard to focus

708
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,880
on one of these topics um you know we

709
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
could easily carry on 50 minutes on any

710
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
of the things that we talked talk about

711
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
but you know here just kind of coming

712
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,559
back to the software that joe mentions

713
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
there's lots of different applications

714
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,679
when you get a software-defined radio

715
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
you need to have some software to run on

716
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,400
it

717
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,000
you know there's lots of interesting

718
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,159
applications that are command line based

719
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,760
uh there's one like rtl 433 which is

720
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
great at sensing everything from your

721
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
neighbors

722
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
weather stations to uh cars as they

723
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,679
drive past and detecting their tire

724
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,679
pressure monitoring systems so there's

725
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,279
lots of interesting command line

726
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,080
applications but what's unique with um

727
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
software defined uh or i should say sdr

728
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,320
angel is if we look at a lot of the

729
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,760
things that joe and i talked about so

730
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
for example with joe if we're looking at

731
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,799
the ubidx project there's ways that you

732
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
can interface a

733
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,919
cheap sdr on the receive end and output

734
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,520
the signals from that into a program

735
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,039
like this and then you can visualize all

736
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,480
the rf around you so if you're looking

737
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
for signals in a certain range you can

738
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,799
see that which is actually pretty cool

739
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,720
if we looked at like the the has violet

740
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
project that joe and i worked on

741
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
sending loras signals

742
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,520
inbuilt into sdr angel you can send and

743
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
receive low raw signals which is

744
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,360
actually pretty neat so if you do have a

745
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
hack rf you can not only receive you

746
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
could also transmit which is quite

747
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
unique and then same thing on the rf

748
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
distributions as

749
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,000
joe said sometimes packages break if

750
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
anyone's played around with linux long

751
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,279
enough you know you got to run different

752
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
commands or if one thing stops working

753
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
it blows up all sorts of other software

754
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,640
and interdependencies and so what we've

755
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
tried to do is to circumnavigate a lot

756
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
of that and that's why we really like

757
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,679
sdr angel because a lot of that

758
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,520
annoyance is done for you in one

759
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,039
application so

760
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,760
you could monitor traditional analog

761
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,159
signals you can receive

762
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,000
digital and analog television you can

763
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
receive aircraft transponders there's

764
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,200
like so many different things that you

765
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,919
can do in this one application and um

766
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,159
for how long that the developer eduard

767
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
has been focusing on this i've been

768
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
starting to see a lot of what he's done

769
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
is being carried over into other

770
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
software-defined applications like sdr

771
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,440
plus plus and uh sdr uno and a few

772
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
others and so that's kind of like how

773
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
we're tying back sdr angel to what uh

774
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,679
joe talked about and then for myself

775
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,279
which i kind of touched on a lot of this

776
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,640
on the hacker f um and m17

777
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
as of five days ago on the sdr angel git

778
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,559
repository they're now officially

779
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
supporting the m17 mode for transmit and

780
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
receive they only have it working under

781
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,039
linux which is kind of annoying for

782
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,880
those that are into windows but somebody

783
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
tells me those in the audience here

784
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
today uh won't really find that too much

785
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
of an annoyance but uh it's a very

786
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,279
active project it's by far one of the

787
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
most updated ones

788
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,840
probably every two three weeks there's a

789
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,399
new revision that comes out and then a

790
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
beta and then another major development

791
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,200
and so that's why joe and i looked at

792
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
the sig pi project to think what's the

793
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
easier way to kind of update that

794
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,679
without having to break all sorts of

795
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,159
other interdependencies but again if

796
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,679
you're interested in software-defined

797
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,399
radio i highly suggest uh sdr angel it's

798
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,440
something that you definitely need in

799
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,279
your toolbox to really get the most out

800
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,559
of what you're doing especially with a

801
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
device like a hacker ref

802
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
so here's a screenshot of a couple of

803
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
the different windows in sdr angel again

804
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,080
if anyone wants to kind of take a look

805
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
and say hey can you show me how to do

806
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,000
this industrial angel happy to kind of

807
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,159
walk you through in the rf village um

808
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,640
what i'm showing here in the center

809
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
is one of their new features where you

810
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,200
can do a 3d model of the rf spectrum so

811
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,440
instead of just seeing like a uh like

812
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
from the movie contact where you have

813
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
like a big spike in the middle of a of a

814
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,919
screen or if you're thinking of like a

815
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,240
traditional oscilloscope this not only

816
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
you can do that and look at waterfalls

817
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,000
but you could actually use your mouse

818
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,679
and you could actually move around the

819
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,440
rf spectrum so you can look at it in a

820
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
three-dimensional way which is actually

821
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,799
really unique especially if you're

822
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
thinking about narrow bands or even very

823
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
wideband signals there's some really

824
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
cool things that you can do there so

825
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
that's in the center and then to the

826
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,720
right what makes sdr angel different is

827
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
when you want to say receive or transmit

828
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,200
a different mode so let's say if it's am

829
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,919
or sideband or morse code or lora or

830
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,360
adsb or you know whatever

831
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
the way that they call this is you have

832
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,200
to run a

833
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,520
separate application for it so you could

834
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,039
actually let's say for example if you

835
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,600
wanted to monitor a specific frequency

836
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
you can monitor that frequency as

837
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,919
different modes at the same time or

838
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,440
let's say if you wanted to monitor

839
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
multiple frequencies at the same time

840
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,039
with different modes you can do that

841
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,520
with one radio so for example if we look

842
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,600
at like a hacker f this will give you a

843
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,840
pass band of about 10 megahertz so at

844
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,600
any point let's say f and broadcast

845
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,520
bands i could look at 10 megahertz of

846
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,679
spectrum for the fm broadcast band at

847
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,760
the same time if i wanted to i could run

848
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
a separate wideband fm demodulator and i

849
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,159
could listen to multiple radio stations

850
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
at the same time is it really useful

851
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
maybe maybe not but let's say if you

852
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,279
wanted to monitor multiple uh aircraft

853
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,600
or multiple data signals within that

854
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
pass band of 10 megahertz or in some

855
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
devices that go much higher that's one

856
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,880
of the unique things that you can do

857
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,559
with sdr angel none of the other

858
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,159
software out there that i'm familiar

859
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,640
with which is most of them allows you to

860
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,760
do that i would say that don't sheep out

861
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,360
i know i've seen a bunch of like those

862
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
60 laptops floating around

863
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
please do yourself a favor use a real

864
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,240
computer sometimes sdr can be a little

865
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,399
bit compute intensive so you're going to

866
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,000
get a bad experience if you're using

867
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,159
like a budget computer so if you are

868
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,559
interested in sdr angel either i'd

869
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,159
suggest take a look at the sig pi

870
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,600
project because you can do a lot of that

871
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,679
on a raspberry pi 4 and then you can use

872
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,320
your cheapo 60 laptops or if you have a

873
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,000
really good machine then you're going to

874
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,240
really extract a lot more data out of

875
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
playing around with a program like sdr

876
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
angel

877
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
and again this is open source so

878
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,559
everything's super well documented again

879
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,440
it's a really great project high

880
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
documentation you really understand what

881
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,840
to do it's not like a lot of repos that

882
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,120
we've probably all come across that

883
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
sound great and then it just leaves us

884
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,159
to to wonder what exactly is going on so

885
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,159
really a great project

886
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,440
um and then

887
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
kind of uh starting to close things up

888
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,880
here the open rtx project which is sort

889
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,360
of kind of related to m17 but it's

890
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
unique in its own way

891
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,919
uh if anyone remembers

892
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
at least eight years ago there was a

893
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,559
really cheap inexpensive dmr radio that

894
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
came to market by a company called at

895
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,200
the time they were called titera

896
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,320
that's what got a lot of people

897
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
interested in dmr it was a commercial

898
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,399
standard that motorola introduced it

899
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,600
became quasi open standard through etsy

900
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,399
and then cheap uh chinese manufacturers

901
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,159
started to churn out radios and now it

902
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
allowed many people to get involved in

903
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
digital voice

904
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,519
at the amateur radio level for a very

905
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
very cheap cost oftentimes under a

906
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
hundred dollars today you could even buy

907
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
some dmr radios for as low as 30 dollars

908
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
which i'll have one at the uh at the rf

909
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,919
village if anyone wants to take a look

910
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,200
at that

911
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
but with what what openrtx does is not

912
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
only on the project page does it talk

913
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,120
about how to modify the firmware that

914
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,399
would get loaded onto one of these

915
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,039
radios which is really what made the md

916
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,480
380 and tyt radios very popular with uh

917
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,240
folks like travis goodspeed and uh

918
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,320
lidiata over at adafruit you know they

919
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
kind of like really jumped on this and i

920
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
think that helps really propel it the

921
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,480
next evolution is if you look at openrtx

922
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
not only does it kind of take a similar

923
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
approach to modifying the firmware but

924
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,519
they also give you instructions on how

925
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,000
to actually modify the physical hardware

926
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,159
to allow it to send and receive m17

927
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,399
signals so it's really one of these cool

928
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,720
projects and it's it's nice to see

929
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,799
developers of a mode which is open

930
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,919
source m17 working with an open source

931
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,279
version of firmware that would sit on a

932
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,720
proprietary closed source piece of

933
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
hardware

934
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
there's so much really interesting uh

935
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
future and again i think this does a

936
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,519
really great job of talking about how to

937
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,559
blur the lines between both hardware and

938
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,279
software from an open source perspective

939
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,120
and then we'll just kind of close things

940
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,760
up just to summarize we covered a lot i

941
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,600
think we've covered a lot of grounds if

942
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,039
anyone's heads are spinning hopefully

943
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
they're not the case but come and chat

944
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,200
with us in the aura village

945
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,799
covered a lot of ways that you can look

946
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,640
at hardware and software together so

947
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
it's not one or the other these days

948
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,000
it's often a combination of both

949
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
didn't really touch on it too

950
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
deeply but when you're playing around

951
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
with different radio signals especially

952
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,679
if you have a software-defined radio

953
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,840
that's capable of transmitting anywhere

954
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
between zero to six thousand megahertz

955
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
uh do things ethically uh you might be

956
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,960
tempted to go open up your neighbors

957
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,360
tesla guest store

958
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
that's fun you can look at all sorts of

959
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
great little weird things you can

960
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,159
transmit

961
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,559
paging signals but do so ethically you

962
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,080
know we don't want to have some of these

963
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
great toys that we like to experiment

964
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,640
with

965
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,559
get on the radar of

966
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,320
of people that make policy and

967
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
regulation and make it harder for us to

968
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
kind of experiment with things and

969
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,799
that's one of the fun things with an

970
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,720
amateur radio as long as you have an

971
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,039
amateur radio license you can experiment

972
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,799
on the frequencies and spectrum that we

973
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,239
have and there's over 23 000 megahertz

974
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,639
of discontinuous spectrum so it's not

975
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,520
like 80 meters at 3.8 megahertz lead at

976
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,280
night like the example that joe showed

977
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
on the ubidex if you want to experiment

978
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
with a

979
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
slightly lower than standard 2.4

980
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
gigahertz wi-fi amateur radio has set

981
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,960
aside spectrum at 2.3 gigahertz we also

982
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,599
have 5.8 we have 10 gigahertz 20

983
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,040
gigahertz

984
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
144 megahertz 220 megahertz is so much

985
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
different spectrum different frequencies

986
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
do different things and so i would

987
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
highly encourage even if somebody's not

988
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,839
interested in talking on the radio get

989
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,440
your amateur radio license there's lots

990
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
to do just on data and again it helps

991
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,280
you kind of stay safe if you want to

992
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
experiment you can do so in a safe

993
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
sandbox in the amateur radio spectrum

994
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,879
and again

995
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,960
what hopefully joe and i encourage is

996
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,040
try to do new things rf is kind of a fun

997
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,639
thing that you could experiment with

998
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,440
there's lots to do for everybody

999
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,880
don't focus on just everything that's

1000
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
already been done you know look at some

1001
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,839
of the the great work that some of these

1002
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,320
projects kind of talk about and maybe

1003
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,599
one day you'll be up here giving a

1004
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,040
similar presentation on one of your

1005
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
latest projects and so with that

1006
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,460
i'll let joe handle any q a

1007
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:23,359
[Applause]

1008
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,640
everyone thank you very much for your

1009
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
time and attention uh before i go into

1010
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
qa i just want to give you a gentle

1011
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,920
reminder like i said we're going to be

1012
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
at the rf village which is cohabitating

1013
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,599
with the hardware hacking village down

1014
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,000
on the third floor we also have we've

1015
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
mentioned we have a repeater up and

1016
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
running right now so anyone who have hts

1017
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
with you

1018
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,680
the users the frequencies in the

1019
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,760
settings and as andrew mentioned before

1020
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,839
we should have at least down we have a

1021
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,480
trailer down uh stairs uh just outside

1022
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
around the corner where we actually had

1023
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,520
the repeater based out of

1024
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,000
that um we've been trying to set some

1025
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,119
stuff up so questions

1026
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,839
no no worries yeah we might even have it

1027
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,839
accidentally backwards as far as reasons

1028
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,599
receive and transmit compared to a usual

1029
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,599
up five down five so

1030
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,119
yeah the repeater is operational i can

1031
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,320
help you get it configured i had a

1032
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
question for you guys regarding sdrs

1033
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,079
could you give me a real quick rundown

1034
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,440
of what your opinions are between the

1035
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,400
hack rf and the blade rf

1036
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
you familiar with that

1037
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
yeah so

1038
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,119
so hacker f bleed rf

1039
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,280
two kind of totally different beasts two

1040
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
totally different price points i'm not

1041
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
going to say one's better than the other

1042
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,560
there's lots of specifications you know

1043
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,920
if we're all buying computers we're

1044
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
probably comparing how much ram or hard

1045
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
drives or speed or whatever most sdrs i

1046
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
would say if you look at the specs

1047
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,040
they're going to be pretty accurate with

1048
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,960
the bleed rf you're looking at a

1049
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
slightly higher cost point

1050
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,599
the hacker f is a lot less expensive

1051
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,119
but i wouldn't say really one's better

1052
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,560
than the other the difference though

1053
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
however with a hacker f is it's a heck

1054
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
of a lot more portable

1055
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,040
compared to something like a blade rf or

1056
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
to put this on your

1057
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
christmas wish list the lime sdr mini

1058
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,599
2.0 which recently came out this is

1059
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
similar comparable functionality but

1060
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
it's a lot less scary looking especially

1061
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,680
if you're going through like an airport

1062
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,800
because it just looks like a standard

1063
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
wi-fi dongle if you go through with like

1064
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
a blade rf

1065
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,599
you know you might get a couple more

1066
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,960
questions it just looks like a regular

1067
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,200
dongle so did it really didn't really

1068
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,720
answer your question no i think that

1069
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,160
helped and to amplify what you were

1070
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
saying before my amateur radio license

1071
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,920
has helped me with the tsa and other

1072
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,839
agencies when i'm flying and traveling

1073
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,960
because they have questions about your

1074
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,400
equipment you pull out your license and

1075
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,680
say well actually i'm licensed by the

1076
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
federal government you can go

1077
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
pound sand so it usually works but one

1078
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
final question between the two of you

1079
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
guys what is your favorite modes and

1080
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,680
bands that you like to use

1081
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
i'm going to let joe talk about that

1082
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,640
first so i can get the easy question

1083
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
the question is what's favorite band

1084
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,119
bands and modes

1085
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,520
yeah i'm more of a non-talker so i like

1086
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,880
digital modes um and that scope cw and

1087
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,119
i'll keep keep that behind but you know

1088
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,359
steve's one has turned me on to the 17

1089
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,240
meter band right and as far as going to

1090
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,920
18.1 megahertz and between antenna size

1091
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,680
between low power and everything else

1092
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
that's why i'm pretty much enjoying it

1093
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,839
and also i've been finding digital modes

1094
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
on uh or ft8 modes on six meters which

1095
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,359
been rather interesting so

1096
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,440
that's gotten me you know away from the

1097
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
fray of typically you know 40 and 40

1098
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,560
meters at night to do some stuff

1099
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
all right and i guess just to follow on

1100
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
joe he kind of stole some of my thunder

1101
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,359
on things that i've kind of forced him

1102
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,920
into like uh amateur radio hf there's

1103
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
the traditional bands 80 40 20 15 and 10

1104
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,119
meters there's what's called the warp

1105
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,240
bands which

1106
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
were kind of set aside for different

1107
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
reasons and so often times a lot of ham

1108
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
radio people kind of avoid these extra

1109
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,079
frequencies for no good reason just

1110
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,200
because they just choose to not

1111
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
understand them more because it's too

1112
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,839
hard there's nothing really different

1113
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,680
about it but there's a lot of different

1114
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
and unique activity especially on the 17

1115
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
meter band which is 18.1 megahertz plus

1116
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,880
and minus or so uh

1117
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,040
six meters which is 50 to 54 megahertz

1118
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
when i was a kid i loved six meters my

1119
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,240
neighbors didn't because uh tv channel

1120
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
two yeah i think it was either two or

1121
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,440
four

1122
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
uh let's just say every time that i

1123
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,560
transmit on six meters my neighbors were

1124
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,680
not a fan especially when they were

1125
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
watching the news and so a lot of people

1126
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
tended to avoid six meters if they had

1127
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,480
cranky neighbors like me

1128
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,520
but otherwise my official answer is i

1129
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
enjoy things related to satellite

1130
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,400
communications and so i'm going uh using

1131
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
2 meters and 70 centimeters so that's

1132
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,400
144 and 440 megahertz similar to the

1133
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
band that the uh the repeater that we

1134
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,119
keep talking about uses um but it also

1135
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,640
permits me to experiment at other

1136
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,880
frequencies like 10 gigahertz and so i

1137
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
like pushing the envelope quite a bit in

1138
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
terms of modes

1139
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,200
um

1140
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,320
i'll talk

1141
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,720
but i also like doing data i think if we

1142
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
kind of below that path just well what

1143
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
else can you do aside from just send

1144
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,160
little text messages and morse code and

1145
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,319
stuff like that i like experimenting

1146
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
with sending video or images and so

1147
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,160
there's a

1148
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,640
technology called slow scan television

1149
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,480
where you can send images

1150
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,079
sounds kind of like a fax machine you

1151
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,680
can send an image over a very narrow

1152
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,520
slice of spectrum it takes about a

1153
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,280
minute or so to send a

1154
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,680
fairly good quality image that's analog

1155
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,119
there's also a digital variant that i

1156
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,440
experiment with and then i'll definitely

1157
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,359
be playing around with it today is

1158
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,640
digital amateur tv so similar

1159
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,880
modes that you'd have for satellite so

1160
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
like dvd s2 is an example so if anyone

1161
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,079
has like directv or similar things like

1162
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:46,880
that

1163
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
we could use similar technology to send

1164
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,359
that type of high quality h.264

1165
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,319
standard video uh using

1166
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,359
little

1167
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,200
sdrs like this and so

1168
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
that's what i like to experiment with

1169
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,800
all the all the things that some people

1170
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
are scared of but eventually i pull

1171
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
people like joe into some of this stuff

1172
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,359
and so it's uh it's fun so thank you for

1173
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
that good question

1174
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
yes steve

1175
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
steve's a bit humble on the satellite

1176
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,640
but i've seen steve with the handheld

1177
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,480
radio the arrow antenna which is like

1178
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,880
maybe 100 bucks and then going to the

1179
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,640
cell phone looking at the software for

1180
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,400
the satellite predictions and like oh

1181
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,160
yeah he got it there he goes making the

1182
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
connection through iss or avenue so

1183
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
steve would tell you it sounds satellite

1184
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
might sound intimidating but really

1185
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,200
isn't if you just pretty much keep

1186
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,800
keeping it simple where you you know you

1187
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
get the software that shows you where

1188
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,160
the satellites are you get you have just

1189
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,599
a reasonable antenna to point it and

1190
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,079
then the radio to actually hear it so

1191
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,760
oh and then i guess just to kind of jump

1192
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
on that an sdr angel it does satellite

1193
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,319
predictions so you could actually look

1194
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,599
at all that

1195
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,440
and if you marry that in with the

1196
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
reception basically it does it all in

1197
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,280
one program which is actually really

1198
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,480
cool so

1199
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
another plug for that that sdr angel and

1200
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,480
no i don't get paid as a spokesperson

1201
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,160
for it i just really enjoy that software

1202
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,079
because it's uh it's free so

1203
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,079
it's uh it's open for everybody uh any

1204
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,599
other questions otherwise thank you so

1205
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,119
much for the time uh yes

1206
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,040
do we have a mic yeah

1207
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,880
in the back

1208
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,990
can

1209
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,480
[Music]

1210
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,400
real quick while i'm handing this over

1211
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
um what are you transmitting to the

1212
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
satellite

1213
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,280
so uh we can transmit uh either voice

1214
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,400
signals

1215
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,359
uh morse code digital data

1216
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,040
pretty much anything but basically a lot

1217
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
of the amateur radio satellites function

1218
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,560
as a repeater so basically you send a

1219
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,839
signal up on

1220
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
the up and then it bounces back down on

1221
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
another and so the benefit when you have

1222
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,599
one of these low earth orbit satellites

1223
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
spinning overhead at 22 000 miles is

1224
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,560
with very modest equipment your

1225
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,040
communications footprint changes from

1226
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,119
let's say a few miles to

1227
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,119
up to a thousand miles because it's the

1228
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,119
satellite 200 miles above it's like a

1229
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,960
big spotlight looking down and so within

1230
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,319
that footprint of the satellite while

1231
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,920
it's overhead you can communicate with

1232
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
anyone within that footprint

1233
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,440
i have a slightly like off-topic

1234
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,480
question

1235
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,440
do you think we will ever see the same

1236
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
diversity of open soft

1237
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
open source software and hardware

1238
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
for communicating over like

1239
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,880
mobile networks as as we see with the

1240
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,440
ham radio

1241
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,160
yes so if i understood the question so

1242
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,240
thinking about mobile networks and their

1243
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,359
spectrum

1244
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,040
a lot of the workflows that you'd have

1245
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,119
on these devices if you wanted to

1246
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,839
basically make your own cell phone base

1247
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,280
station

1248
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,040
you could actually experiment with this

1249
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,520
that way

1250
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,680
you could also

1251
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,640
do

1252
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,720
what's called a private network so if

1253
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,119
you wanted to experiment with

1254
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,800
spectrum that you're allowed to utilize

1255
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,760
that on you can if you wanted to receive

1256
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,680
mobile network signals and try to decode

1257
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,520
them you can some are easier than others

1258
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,720
most of them you can't because they're

1259
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,359
proprietary and encrypted but you know

1260
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
that's one of the cool things with these

1261
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,160
if i looked at

1262
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,640
like a hacker f if you wanted to look at

1263
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,040
what channels are being used if you

1264
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,720
thought about who are the technicians

1265
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,000
that are out there servicing this

1266
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,520
equipment they're going to have really

1267
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,960
expensive equipment that does something

1268
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,560
similar but if you wanted to see

1269
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,480
channels you could visualize that all

1270
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
with you know these inexpensive pieces

1271
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
of software which is uh or hardware i

1272
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
should say which is kind of cool does

1273
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,960
that

1274
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,480
help answer the question if i heard it

1275
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,319
right yeah yeah thank you thank you

1276
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
yeah uh just follow up to my question is

1277
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,319
there a specific satellite you're using

1278
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,839
for this

1279
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,839
so there's a lot of different satellites

1280
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,000
just in the past few days there was a

1281
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
batch of ten that were

1282
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
hand launched from the international

1283
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,920
space station and some of those are

1284
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,599
sending a combination of various

1285
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,680
different signals so that's super

1286
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,040
current right now i'd probably say

1287
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,520
there's maybe 35 or 40 active amateur

1288
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,920
radio satellites including some of the

1289
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,520
payload on the international space

1290
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
station that's active so

1291
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,800
there's quite a lot i'd probably say

1292
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,079
there's going to be some type of an

1293
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,760
amateur radio satellite spinning

1294
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,480
overhead once every five or six minutes

1295
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,760
so as long as you have the equipment to

1296
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,680
support it there's definitely something

1297
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,720
to to monitor

1298
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,680
one thing a lot of people don't know

1299
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,280
about amateur radio is the emergency

1300
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,599
communication support that they provide

1301
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,440
this seems like a great way to bring in

1302
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
bring data in and out of those areas

1303
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
when you set up emergency communications

1304
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,599
are you guys doing anything with that

1305
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,520
so with devices like a hacker ref

1306
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
they're very very low power they're not

1307
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,280
really designed probably to support

1308
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
something for like emergency

1309
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,839
communications they're more of like an

1310
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,240
experimentation tool but if we think

1311
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,800
about the functionality of sdr there are

1312
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,800
devices that to your point are very very

1313
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
interesting as it relates to emergency

1314
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,560
communications because they're agile if

1315
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,920
you wanted to have

1316
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,200
a higher power transmit capable device

1317
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,359
to immediately

1318
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,440
program it to the mode or method of

1319
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,520
communications that you're looking for

1320
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,839
then yes this is something that it would

1321
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,359
be great to start seeing at least from

1322
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,800
the amateur radio emergency

1323
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,720
communication so i'd start to embrace a

1324
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,640
little bit more

1325
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,680
that's a good question thank you

1326
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,079
let's have questions

1327
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,160
again thank you very much for your time

1328
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,720
we hope you enjoyed the session

1329
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,959
thank you

1330
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,799
you
