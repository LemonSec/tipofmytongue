11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,840

[Applause]

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
that comes to us from our designer in

16
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
north macedonia so it's really uh

17
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,239
awesome to see that and he designed all

18
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,680
the t-shirts and the logo and everything

19
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,840
stefan wish you were here

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,920
um welcome everybody to a new hope

21
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
and the reason we're calling it a new

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,000
hope is because it is a new beginning a

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
new chapter um

24
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
how many i can barely see people with

25
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
the lights but how many of you were at

26
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,319
the first hope in 1994.

27
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,920
a good number a handful but a good

28
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,879
handful

29
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,640
cool and of course i was there

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,239
yeah

31
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
let me tell you that conference um

32
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
one thing we knew when we started the

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
conference was that it was impossible

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
and the reason it was impossible was

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,959
because everybody told us that uh it was

36
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
you know we had we had gone to um a

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,000
number of us had gone to the netherlands

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,879
um where they make it all seem so easy

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
and fun and

40
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
all we ever heard was how that could

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,478
never happen in the states that could

42
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,000
never happen in new york they'd never

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,358
let you do it

44
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
so we decided to do it anyway and see

45
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
what happened

46
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
fortunately for us there was this cheap

47
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
ass hotel called hotel pennsylvania that

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
allowed us to actually do it

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
and we had the first conference first

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
hacker conference in the united states

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
with over a thousand people back in 1994

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
and the rest is history until

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
we um

54
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
we reached 2019 when we tried to uh plan

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,199
for 2020 at hotel pennsylvania that's

56
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
when we were told by them that their

57
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
prices had tripled because we had helped

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
them

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
save the hotel from destruction and

60
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
rebuild it so now

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
now they were going to charge more

62
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
premium rates um tripling the price

63
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
would have meant that

64
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
a lot of you couldn't have made it and

65
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
we knew that was unacceptable we don't

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
want to be one of these thousand dollar

67
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
person uh conferences

68
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
so we started looking for alternatives

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
and look what we found we found this

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
place

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
and

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
apparently so did you so welcome to st

73
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,360
john's

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
we love the campus it's beautiful the

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
people here have been great uh just

76
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
helping us in every way

77
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,320
and

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
we plan to have a fantastic conference

79
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
here in 2020

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
but

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
there was a complication in

82
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,840
in the form of a global pandemic that uh

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
prevented us from doing a in person

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
conference in 2020 we had a great

85
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,240
digital uh you know virtual conference

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
hope 2020 was a nine-day event which we

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
had a lot of fun with

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
um

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
but we uh we really wanted to give this

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
place a try because

91
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
we saw it as a new chapter back then

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
um

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
so uh we had to postpone until 2022 and

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
that's where we are now and you know

95
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
kind of um uh

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
you know a karma type of a thing uh

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
hotel pennsylvania which tripled its

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,319
prices and gave us the middle finger

99
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
they're currently being demolished

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
i'm not happy about that because even if

101
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
even if we're not there

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
i still believe that the building should

103
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,759
have been preserved and i think they're

104
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,120
a bunch of idiots for for tearing it

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
down and replacing it with a skyscraper

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
but there's only so much we can do we

107
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
helped save it for ten years and that's

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
something

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
this is a new chapter this is a new hope

110
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
this is our new hope and um

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
what you guys do the experiences you

112
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
guys have you're going to be determining

113
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
uh our future whether or not we do this

114
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
again here uh whether or not we expand

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
this place is there is so much we can do

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
here uh we can have a conference ten

117
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
times this size easily in this in this

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
area uh we're only using one building

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
right now but um we could be much bigger

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,599
we don't necessarily want to be much

121
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
bigger but we could be

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
it's a tough period because

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
the world is traumatized we've lost so

124
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,599
much we've been through so much

125
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,400
and

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
there's a lot of division out there i

127
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
hope during this weekend we can be the

128
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
exception to that we can take care of

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
each other look out for each other hey

130
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,080
you might see you know your worst enemy

131
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
here and if you do you know

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
either give them a nod or just pass by

133
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
and you know avoid each other whatever

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
this is not the place for

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,040
100 or so speakers workshop folks

136
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
virtual attendees and people that are

137
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
checking out the live stream this

138
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,800
is impossible

139
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,199
thank you

140
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,680
believe it

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
um i'm not going to dwell on these but

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
we do have some campus maps downstairs

143
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
you're here you know how to get here or

144
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,839
you're in a little theater or you're in

145
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
the simulcast room you know how you got

146
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
here we have in the program the printed

147
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
conference program if you didn't get one

148
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
pick it up downstairs

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,240
uh fourth floor is main track one and

150
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
may contain hackers we're doing live

151
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
streaming of the dutch camp which is i

152
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
guess impossible i mean

153
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,040
yeah we're doing it again with the dutch

154
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
we did we tried this in 1997 and it was

155
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
it was terrible we couldn't connect at

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
all so we're going to try it again

157
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
they're having a camp a hacker camp at

158
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,000
the same time we're having a hacker

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,279
conference so it's

160
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
it's really pretty incredible and cool

161
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
because they inspired us to do the first

162
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,519
hope the dutch not these people but the

163
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,120
dutch people in general

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
and um

165
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
hopefully we inspire each other now yeah

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,399
it's amazing so we'll have their streams

167
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
in a room up the hall and level four we

168
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
also have a fishbowl or a simulcast room

169
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279

network but we layered our own ssid over

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,839
it so that we're using a vlan provided

200

by uh by st john's they have 40 gigabit

201
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,839
uplink so use more

202
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,800
bandwidth and i'll tell people the

203
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,079

210
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,440

two very quick reminders and then we'll

215
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,440
get into a very brief program summary

216
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
and then we'll uh

217
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,279
don't be almost ready to sum up so um

218

be excellent to one another this is a

220
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
code of conduct we expect a lot of

221
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
attendees we expect even more of

222
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
volunteers

223
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,519
we have a

224
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
let's say better more mature way of

225
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,440
dealing with sort of issues and stuff

226
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
like that we hope we don't get to test

227
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
that a whole lot but we we do want

228
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
everybody here to be a participant in

229

237
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,040
can this is going all through the

238
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
overnights there's three tracks of this

239
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
three tracks of that all kinds of other

240
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
things get the most that you can out of

241
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
it and uh

242
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
um

243
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
also try not to be impatient if you

244
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
don't

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
get to see something that that you

246
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,680
wanted to see uh and also

247
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,560
okay

248
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
so i don't know if anyone has seen one

249
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
of these

250
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
so it has this design

251
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,120
lets it go over the nose part

252
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,760
as well as the mouth part amazing

253
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
so

254
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
so

255
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
everyone is here

256
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
they went through proof of acts

257
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,920
everyone is here because they preferred

258
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,000
to have a conference where they could be

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
confident that other people were masking

260
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
and that they would be keeping each

261
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
other more safe like this

262
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,199
no not like that no no

263
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,920
a little up a little up yeah thank you

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
um yeah so this was you know we're a

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
private organization doing a private

266
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
event on a private campus we make the

267
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,759
rules and it was loud and clear that

268
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,839
what attendees wanted was to have a

269
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
feeling of safety we're in a time of

270
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,839
surge you know you know all this stuff

271
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,639
so

272
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
let's do each other a favor unless

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
you're on stage or eating or drinking

274
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
let's wear the mask and let's gently

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,519
remind each other

276
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,240
if a little mask protocol needs to be uh

277
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
needs to be improved you might see some

278
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
confused st john students wandering

279
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
around that aren't wearing masks if you

280
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
do just you know remind them it's safer

281
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
to wear a mask especially around us

282
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,399
tell them you'll catch a computer virus

283
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,800
otherwise

284
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
but they're new you know they're young

285
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,040
be gentle

286
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
and they'll get the message i'm pretty

287
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
sure yeah yep so thanks for being part

288
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
of that thanks for going along with it

289
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,839
because we know it's difficult for some

290
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
people it's not ideal

291
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
but it's the best thing that we can do

292
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,959
for each other and that's what we're

293
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
trying to do here at a new hope uh last

294
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
a

295
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,040
couple of points here on a couple of

296
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
don'ts so there's no smoking this is a

297
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
non-smoking indoor situation this is a

298
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,839
dry campus no alcohol no drugs they're

299
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
pretty strict about it um

300
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
the conference will not intervene

301
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
if you are ejected because you're not

302
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,760
adhering to those rules so so please

303
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
act accordingly

304
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,439
we have a code of conduct

305
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,359
that says among other things

306
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,520
primarily be excellent to each other it

also says no harassment no

308
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
interpretation no stalking no unwanted

309
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,480
or inappropriate photography things like

310
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039

311
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
feel like you're in a situation where

312
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
someone is

313
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,280
doing that and we'll have two virtual

338
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
workshops that are only a half hour long

339
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
that are kind of interesting about

340
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
mindfulness and health the other

341
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,400
workshops are

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
very diverse we have a whole room

343
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
devoted to ones making physical things

344
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,120
i'll be giving workshops on that

345
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
like about arduino about music synthesis

346
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
and

347
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
lighting things up with cool colors so

348
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
uh there's about freedom of information

349
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
which is happening

350
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
up next uh about how to do cool things

351
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
with wi-fi

352
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
that other people might not think are so

353
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
cool sometimes but

354
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
think like a hacker is also happening

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
today for people who are new here you

356
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,160
might want to check that out because gus

357
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
is

358
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
very experienced in thinking like a

359
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
hacker and she'll be sharing stuff there

360
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
stuff about remote hardware like if

361
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
there's places in the world that don't

362
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,960
have cool hardware that is easily

363
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
available to us they can access it

364
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
remotely there's a workshop on that and

365
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
there's all sorts of other workshops

366
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080

409
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
printed schedule

410
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
is has been superseded by reality uh but

411
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
it's pretty close but do do check the

412
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
online schedule and uh we have some

413
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
posted around uh the site as well for

414
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
the uh the latest updates on

415
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
one other thing um there is one person

416
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
who is an incredible workshop presenter

417
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,520
who

418
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
had four three-hour workshops and he

419
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
caught covid and couldn't come from

420
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,559
california so if other people want to

421
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,000
give

422
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
workshops fitting in those time slots

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
let me know and we can put your cool

424
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,559
stuff so you can share it with other

425
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
people yeah you can expect a few

426
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,919
schedule changes because of reasons like

427
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
that i've never seen so many

428
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
situations change so quickly

429
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,840
so people are catching kovid but also

430
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,919
there's all kinds of automobile problems

431
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,840
like on a scale i've never witnessed

432
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,799
either

433
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,360
flat tires blown up engines

434
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,000
and of course canceled planes everywhere

435
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,440
those of you who traveled here probably

436
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
experienced some of that

437
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,559
so there will be some changes and

438
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,600
they'll be marked on the program the

439
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
announcement board in between programs

440
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
in between talks uh so that's where

441
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
we'll be updating things yeah the uh the

442
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
online program via www.hope.net

443
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
is the canonical updated program so

444
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
we're keeping that up to date

445
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
um yeah and we talked about the coffee

446
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,080
house and like i said we'll try to get

447
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,480
sign up sheets uh down at info desk by

448
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
around 1 pm this afternoon and that's

449
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,400

450
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
okay we talked about performances a

451

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
lovely tree and planted it in queens a

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,679
location that is not always known for

505
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,400
its flourishing environment but we have

506
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
a chance here to create something that

507
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
could become a jewel of queens and a

508
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,159
place where the neighborhood and the

509
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,760
people look forward

510
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
to our yearly visit i think that would

511
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
be very lovely

512
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
i run something called hackers got

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
talent which is proof once again that

514
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
you are all not just people staring at

515
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,000
screens but have a wide variety

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
of love and intelligence and i

517
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
i'm always surprised every year what

518
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
your interpretation of that is so please

519
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
get over that hump if you've ever been

520
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,919
to a previous one you know the bar is

521
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,880
very

522
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
very low

523
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
and and and i do want to say just one

524
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
one last thing if i made manual which

525
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
was you know i don't i mean i don't i

526
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,559
come from a certain school i was at the

527
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
first or not first i was first year of

528
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,360
the 2600 meetings back then

529
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,200
i love

530
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
the era

531
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
where i pull up to a convenience store

532
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
put on a mask

533
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
and walk in

534
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
and everyone's fine with it and i walk

535
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,960
past the 97 cameras you can do that in

536
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
the back business you can go into a bank

537
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,279
with a mask on that's that's fine

538
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,120
what a wonderful time this is

539
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
i cannot believe

540
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
that an entire realm of people are like

541
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,000
no see my face panopticon of the

542
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
government

543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,279

dress

545
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
it has been

546
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,039
80 years since an acceptable new male

547
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,520
accessory has joined the clothing

548
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
spectrum so please take advantage of it

549
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,080
thank you

550
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159

where we all are now this is the most

552
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
diverse county in the country that

on that street

559
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
the biggest chinatown in new york city

560
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,240
is about a mile or two away in flushing

572
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
what i heard from does show up right

573

574
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840

575
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,000
talent thank you bring your talent

576

all right um

577
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,799
we talked about these oh i didn't

578
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,799
mention um iot village internet of

579
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,400
things village that's also going on it's

580
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,080
in the program the other items here i

581
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
mentioned before fantastic stuff most of

582
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,679
these are long-running activities um for

583
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
virtual stuff this is a little bit

584
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,039
confusing

585
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,720
and if you're just entirely in person

586
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
you might decide to opt out but we have

587
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,600
a matrix chat and we have and matrix is

588
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,960
just a free

589
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
public chat system little like irc more

590
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
modern

591
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,000
but we have a private area so with your

592
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,679
ticket whether it's a virtual ticket or

593
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,200
an in-person ticket

594
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,640
you have a code

595
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
and follow the instructions on

596
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
wiki.hope.net

597
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,679
to

598
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,679
get a matrix login if you don't already

599
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,279
have one send a the code to a bot

600
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,200
and the bot will then let you into the

601
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,039
conference rooms and this is where you

602
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,440
can send questions to info desk this is

603
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
where you can send questions to each and

604
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
every track which will be um

605
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,000
if someone is paying attention which i'm

606
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
not right now excuse me but if someone

607
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,679
is paying attention to the matrix chat

608
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,360
then you can send in questions for the

609
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
uh you know for the for the speakers and

610
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,399
also um just general open discussion so

611
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
the matrix chat is is you know the

612
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
cornerstone of the virtual program the

613
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,039
other thing that's really cool is um

614
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
uh mozilla hubs

615
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
so the mozilla hubs is essentially a

616
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
virtual environment that you can

617
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
interact with we did both of these

618
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,399
things in 2020 i'm sure a lot of people

619
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,840
here were part of this for the virtual

620
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,200
program uh the hubs in 2022 is

621
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
astounding so just check it out just to

622
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,760
see the beauty uh and it's good to do

623
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
with a fast network connection as well

624
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,279
but in the mozilla hub you can interact

625
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,120
with other people you can also view

626
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
these streams they're pulling in the

627
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,520
same live stream that's going out

628
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,279
now on campus into the world you can

629
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,039
also view those streams in the hub so

630
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,120
two pretty cool aspects of the virtual

631
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,000
uh program uh and encourage you to check

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
that out

633
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
and also if you end up in a simulcast

634
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
room then uh which i know some people

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
are right now that's your way of

636
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,240
interacting with the with the audience

637
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,279
which like i said right now we're not

638
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
for this session we're not set up to do

639
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,720
q a but for most of the other sessions

640
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,159
they will be

641
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
yeah sorry to interrupt i just want to

642
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,320
mention there is a wiki wiki.hope.net

643
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,399
and make use of it every workshop has

644
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
its page a bunch of talks have created

645
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
pages for themselves and if you want to

646
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
create page or pages

647
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,440
you can create an account there and do

648
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
that so

649
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
and as always be excellent to each other

650
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,799
even on the wiki even on the wiki um

651
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,960
uh i mentioned this just briefly before

652
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,039
in your program it has it 416 right up

653
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
the hall will have a simulcast i'm not

654
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
sure that it does right now we're 416.

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,240
you're kind of far away but you're cool

670
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
thank you and and if you guys here go

671
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,760
down to little theater because that's a

672
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
whole track and it's it's a pretty nice

673
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
venue yeah it's a beautiful room

674
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
actually um

675
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
uh we are not going to read the code of

676
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
conduct we mentioned it just before

677
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
the code of conduct is not about

678
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,320
your fighting your bleeding your your um

679
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,200
uh

680
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,159
you know

681
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,880
engaged in criminal behavior that is uh

682
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,559
you know a problem here

683
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,440
it is about the softer issues about uh

684
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
harassment intimidation bothering and

685
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,640
just like i think a lot of us know about

686
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,679
harassment is what someone is doing

687
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,360
might be experienced

688
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,880
differently by the person that it's

689
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,360
being done to so the code of conduct is

690
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,039
really about being excellent to one

691
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,440
another about that uh

692
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
recipient of the behavior being able to

693
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,039
in our case do something about it and

694
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,480
what you can do about it of course you

695
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
can have a discussion but what you can

696
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,720
do is find as i said before one of the

697
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,279
conference people anyone wearing a green

698
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
volunteer shirt anyone with a with a

699
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,640
radio anyone wearing a uniform

700
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
and asked to uh you know to have a

701
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
discussion about the situation so that's

702
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,039
where we're at with code of conduct and

703
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
internally we have somewhat of an

704
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
escalation procedure if you're in a

705
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,159
situation where you're trying to have a

706
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,760
discussion and the answer is let's go

707
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
and talk to this other person please be

708
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,960
patient with that because we do have

709
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
some

710
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,159
experts in things like de-escalation and

711
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,320
intervention and and also first aid and

712
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
that sort of thing

713
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,960
so uh so we ask a lot we ask a lot of

714
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,320
our attendees we ask a lot of our

715
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,679
volunteers and we don't ask for

716
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,440
enforcement we don't ask for getting

717
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
tough with each other we don't ask for

718
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
for

719
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,279
being stern with each other we ask for

720
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,519
being gentle and guiding the type of

721
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,760
behavior that you're hoping to exhibit

722
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
so we ask a lot and we hope that by

723
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
asking this and putting it right up here

724
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
in the slides that that's what's going

725
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,679
to happen this weekend

726
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,200
we can all do that

727
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
we can

728
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,640
i just want to mention what some of what

729
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,240
i was talking about in detail you'll see

730
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,159
them around operation hammond is

731
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,399
uniformed and green they are experts in

732
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
de-escalation and first aid as well a

733
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,440
lot of emts uh they also are the folks

734
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
that checked your proof of vaccination

735
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
so you actually all of you met some of

736
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,919
them they are a an independent group

737
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,519
that we are partnering with for this

738
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,720
conference and we think they're going to

739
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,039
do an excellent excellent job uh there's

740
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,640
a security team they're wearing blue

741
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
shirts this year they almost always will

742
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
have a radio

743
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
these are mostly about perimeter you

744
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
know checking badges making sure people

745
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
aren't where they're not supposed to be

746
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,399
and physical safety but again they can

747
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,480
uh bring issues where they need to be

748
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,240
brought and then we also have campus

749
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
public safety they i think will be

750
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,279
uniform they might have polo shirts but

751
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,640
they'll have you know st john's they'll

752
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,519
have lanyards these are the the campus

753
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,600
security folks but they also are

754
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,760
integrated with our whole response

755
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,480
system and able to address a variety of

756
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,919
issues so

757
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,000
just to say who's who here as an

758
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
attendee as someone with an issue

759
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
go to the first person you find or go to

760
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,000
the room 301 the security dispatch area

761
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
and we'll we'll get you to someone to to

762
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
uh you know to address what's going on

763
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
okay so as i think you can see i think

764
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,760
this is obvious we've thought a lot

765
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
about this we've worked a lot about it

766
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,679
worked a lot on it we're putting it into

767
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,000
action now we'll see how it works maybe

768
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,559
we'll make some adjustments but we are

769
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,039
very very robustly

770
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,159
interested and focused on wellness

771
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,919
and an enjoyable event for everybody

772
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,159
here

773
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,720
all right

774
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
so we're just about out of time so so um

775
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,440
uh yeah again uh reminders uh masks

776
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,279
uh remember that we're all volunteers no

777
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,120
one's working if things aren't up to

778
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
your expectation that's unfortunate but

779
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,919
it doesn't mean that uh um you know you

780
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,320
paid for a particular talk or you had

781
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
great expectations it might not all work

782
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,760
out so you have to be patient about that

783
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
um there are cameras everywhere on

784
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,440
campus oh yeah i know how many people

785
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
have noticed this there's cameras by the

786
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
elevators there's cameras by every door

787
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
there's cameras in the classroom there's

788
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,000
cameras in the hallways

789
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
um so

790
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,839
be aware of that and don't do anything

791
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,280
that you wouldn't want to be on the

792
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
campus security can't do anything stupid

793
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,399
yeah so come back on all of us um

794
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,560
we want to also mention that uninvited

795
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,359
photography is a code of conduct issue

796
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,320
um

797
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,800
group crowd shots taking pictures of the

798
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
of the um the venue taking pictures of

799
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,839
the

800
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
facilities is all okay

801
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
but if you're taking pictures of other

802
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,199
people that's where you should have

803
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,918
permission or be in a clearly public

804
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,560
situation

805
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
last item here almost is how to

806
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
volunteer there's a website

807
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,440

we're pretty good today

813
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,480
but tomorrow is looking looking like we

814
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,960
can use some more volunteers mcs info

815
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,599

volunteering is welcome great way to get

819
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,200
to meet people we talked about wi-fi

820
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
already there's the there's codes hope

821
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
2022

822
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
lower case

823
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,960
um and uh may contain hackers we're

824
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
going to do a joint opening we're going

825
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
to try this again i think maybe maybe

826
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
they're having a harder time getting

827
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
their stream started than we were so

828
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,920
we're not going to uh have a joint zoom

829
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
call or something like that they said

830
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
they were they were trying to put out

831
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
fires and we realized you know that's a

832
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
term that we use a lot too but they're

833
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
at a campground they might actually be

837
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240

858
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,640
burning questions

859
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,599
mozilla hubs go to the

860
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,800
wiki and the url is in there

861
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,920
wiki.hope.net and all you have to do is

862
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,880
browser-based yeah just click on it

863
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,800
just click on it

864
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
all right

865
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
anything else

866
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,359
is there a slack channel

867
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
no we didn't do slack we chose matrix

868
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
you know we looked into a couple

869
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,599
different technologies and we chose

870
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,160
matrix in 2020 and it worked well for us

871
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,760
we're in the matrix it worked so well we

872
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,839
decided to do it again yeah and actually

873
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,200
we had really good support from the

874
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,440
companies yeah it was not io

875
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,320
you mean the main app is element

876
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
yeah matrix is a protocol and the

877
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
software

878
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
is element so it can be a little bit

879
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,560
confusing but they changed some of the

880
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,640
naming around that

881
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,400
i just want to add thank you everyone
