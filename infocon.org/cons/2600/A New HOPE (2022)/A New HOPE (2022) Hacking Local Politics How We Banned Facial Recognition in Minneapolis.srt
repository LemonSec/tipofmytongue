surveillance data privacy all that good

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,519
stuff

we're going to share some tips we're

47
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,080
going to share how you can do the same

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,959
thing

49
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
and really the importance of municipal

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
politics and why everyone should be

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
involved in that

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,720
so just to go over an overview of what

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
we're going to be talking about today

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
we'll introduce ourselves a little bit

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
more talk about our bios then we're

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
going to talk about political science

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
101 just to go over the basics and then

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
we're going to talk about integrated

59
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,560
advocacy and what that actually looks

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
like in the practical world

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
and then we're going to take a minute to

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
look forward and think about what is the

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
impact of this work and what is really

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
the significance of it and how is it

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,239
going to take us to a better future um

66
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
and then we're gonna end with a power

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
mapping exercise um which is an old

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
organizing tool

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,319
um but first let's introduce ourselves

70
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,518
um chris do you want to go ahead

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560

weyland i am a freelance nerd and i'm

74
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,480
the co-chair of restore the fourth

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,879
minnesota just the minnesota chapter of

76
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
the national restore the fourth

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
sort of activist movement

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
and my name is munir muhammad again i

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
work in my day time for the aclu

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
minnesota the american civil liberties

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
union

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
i'm in the policy department which

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
really means we just do a lot of

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
lobbying work for the organization um

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
and then in my

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
spare time i've been involved with

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
restore the fourth um in their board and

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
just trying to work out what it means to

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
actually work in surveillance coalitions

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
and data privacy collisions

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
nationwide

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
so yeah um one of the things actually

93
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
so i i guess going one of the two sort

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,639
of victories that we had that not that

95
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
are not related to um

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
demand and facial recognition is that

97
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
the aclu minnesota just last year passed

98
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
a student data privacy bill which was

99
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
really exciting aristotle for minnesota

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,039
also did a bunch of work beating back an

101
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
additional five million dollars to um

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
our local minnesota fusion center which

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
is like a place to do joint up

104
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
surveillance stuff

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
and i think these victories are really

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
attested to the fact that things have

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,919
been gridlocked and locked at the

108
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,320
national and state level for so long

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
that a lot of our state houses and

110
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
senates really there's just no movement

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
to be had

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
so we've just found a lot of luck in

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
municipal

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
councils

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,360
so to talk about like the timeline of

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
how we actually started

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
introduce the ordinance and pass the

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
ordinance for the facial recognition ban

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
we began in the spring and summer of

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
2020

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
which was

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
pretty eventful and we started this

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
coalition called safety not surveillance

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
and what we did was essentially found a

125
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
star lawmaker a star council member who

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,560
was kind of our champion in the

127
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,720
minneapolis council his name was steve

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
fletcher and he was kind of a tech guy

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,759
and he

130
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
passed this resolution called the data

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
privacy principles

132
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,440
kind of intentions

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
and resolutions they're non-binding but

134
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
they're symbolic and they're meant to

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
you know symbolize that the city is

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
going in a new direction so we thought

137
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
we'd capitalize on this moment after the

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
resolution was passed and get some

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
ordinances into law

140
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,479
so we got the coalition together we

141
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,120
created a website added people

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
and this was a mix of

143
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
grassroots like

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
police reform orgs but also some

145
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
university people

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
and just a nice mix of orgs and

147
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
collectives

148
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
and what happened really was

149
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,240
kind of the unexpected in 2020 of course

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
there was the george floyd uprising

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
and it kind of uh represented a fork in

152
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
the road for our coalition you know when

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
you know when we're talking about police

154
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
reform police brutality

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
brutality against protesters really the

156
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
last thing on people's mind is data

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
privacy surveillance technology it

158
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
doesn't feel immediate it doesn't feel

159
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
like the moment so people's all people's

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
attentions was on

161
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
defund abolition

162
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
getting cops off the street

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
and what really really what we wanted to

164
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
do was pivot it and say that you know

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
it's not just the cop on the street it's

166
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
also the tools that they use it's also

167
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
the data that they have on you

168
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
so what we had to do was essentially

169
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,120
pull back from a much larger

170
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
surveillance transparency

171
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,080
and tech transparency bill called c-cops

172
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
and we pivoted to facial recognition

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
after this and we really wanted to

174
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,599
highlight the intersections of like

175
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,919
police reform and technology when we're

176
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
considering the monitoring and like

177
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
surveillance of protesters

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
many who were you know minors at the

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
time

180
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
so that's why how we pivoted to facial

181
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,120
recognition and started to lobby and

182
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
organize around that

183
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
and this is kind of just the steps that

184
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
we took it was a long process and it's

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
really never guaranteed the time frames

186
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
it's all about political will and

187
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
keeping momentum so we had to negotiate

188
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
language with the staff which is pretty

189
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
dicey when you're talking about city

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
attorneys who are trying to cover the

191
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,639
city's ass you know and don't really

192
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
want to bring about any change and then

193
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
you're negotiating with all the city

194
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
clerks as well who are writing up the

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,599
ordinance and ordinances are just bills

196
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,039
but they call them ordinances at the

197
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,800
local level

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,958
and while negotiating this there's a lot

199
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,360
of like behind the scenes back door you

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
have to work out the language but in

201
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,519
that moment you also have to engage with

202
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
the community you also have to keep

203
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
momentum and pressure on these council

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,880
members so that they know that this

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
isn't just your pet issue right so we

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
held a town hall we held informational

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
sessions for different wards on facial

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
recognition just trying to get people

209
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,920
like their heads around why this is an

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
issue

211
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
and once the language is finished and

212
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
you work out the stuff behind the scenes

213
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
and behind the closed doors you start to

214
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
ferment public support for the bill so

215
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
this is when it's introduced this is

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
when you got to get testimonies fill the

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
council chambers

218
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
really you know get some open letters

219
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
maybe in

220
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
you know whatever publication newspaper

221
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
is local

222
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,080
really just make it a really mobilized

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
effort

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
so after that you know the vote was

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
unanimous we made a pretty strong

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
argument that this facial recognition is

227
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,040
a faulty technology the error rates are

228
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,800
absurd when it comes to non-white faces

229
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
and really the point is that the council

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
members should have much more control

231
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
and oversight over what technology the

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
police department but also the city uses

233
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
um and that's a pretty hard argument

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
to fight against so we got unanimous 13

235
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
votes

236
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
although the mayor did not sign it but

237
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
the mayor is in control of the police

238
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
department so

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
we weren't likely to get like executive

240
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
support

241
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and to be clear it wasn't the mayor

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,000
didn't need to sign it he didn't veto it

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,959
either

244
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
in minneapolis at least there's he can

245
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
sign it he can just ignore it or he can

246
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
veto it and he just ignored it which is

247
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
a de facto approval um we had 13 votes

248
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,880
so if he admitted it we would just

249
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
override the veto so

250
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
true true veto proof um yeah you want to

251
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,399
talk about paulie's eye yeah and so

252
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,760
that's actually an example of sort of

253
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
poly sci 101 is every municipality um

254
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
and this was something that

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
i sort of had to learn because i'm not i

256
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
don't have a background in like activism

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
or i didn't take poli sci 101 um so i

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
sort of had to teach all of this myself

259
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
but each municipality has its own sort

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
of sets of rules and how it's structured

261
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,760
usually based around a charter some

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,959
cities have a

263
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,920
um like a strong mare or like or

264
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,279
sometimes some of them have like a city

265
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
manager system and what i want to

266
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
encourage each of you to do is when you

267
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
go back to your city and start thinking

268
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
about engaging

269
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
your council members or with your county

270
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
you sort of look at the structure of it

271
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
usually usually they'll be like

272
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,399
they'll follow robert's rules of order

273
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,200
or some something like that um

274
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
generally what what happens is they'll

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
like draft a new ordinance

276
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
go to council they'll have some

277
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,640
deliberation

278
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,720
and then the mayor signs or vetoes or

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
whatever there's a process that you have

280
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
to go through

281
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
publicly anyways a lot of the work

282
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
though is done

283
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
not necessarily

284
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
a lot of like the hashing out of the

285
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
details of an ordinance happens behind

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
the scenes

287
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
so it's important to they understand

288
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
like the official formal process that

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
your city and that your municipality

290
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
goes through but it's also important to

291
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
get to know the staff and get to know

292
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
the council members and like

293
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
suss out what that informal behind the

294
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
scenes processes too

295
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,000
for that you really got to start to talk

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,839
to the city bureaucrats too those they

297
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,440
have a lot of

298
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
soft power

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
yeah and although this might seem

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
incredibly dry to be like what is my

301
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
council makeup what is the department's

302
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
you know it really will identify the

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
leverage points the weak points for

304
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,959
example you know

305
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,360
st paul as opposed to minneapolis has a

306
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,839
really strong mayor so if we really just

307
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,839
got in the pocket of mayor

308
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,480
carter and st paul we could ease our way

309
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
to get the council members votes but in

310
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
minneapolis there's a really

311
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
antagonistic relationship between the

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
council and the

313
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
mayor so you really have to pick your

314
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,399
fights and figure out who you're allied

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,360
with

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
and then just other really dry things

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
like figuring out what city directors

318
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
you need to talk with there's so many

319
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
committees there's so many departments

320
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,839
within each city

321
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
each of them having some kind of purview

322
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
and they require feedback and a really

323
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,279
easy way to get voted down in any kind

324
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,600
of bill or ordinance you introduce is to

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
say people will come and say oh you

326
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
didn't speak to us you can't pass this

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
oh you didn't bring this to us uh we

328
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
didn't review this this is too late you

329
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
know it's a really it's a delaying

330
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
tactic that you can easily avoid by

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
figuring out who the right people you

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
need to speak to and speaking to them in

333
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
a timely manner it's a system and it's

334
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
if you spend time this is how i sort of

335
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
convince myself to teach is like oh this

336
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,120
is a complex system that i just need to

337
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
poke at and prod and figure out in order

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
to get it to do what i want so that's

339
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
that's what i would encourage folks to

340
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
do here to do is figure out figure out

341
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
what your local system is and where the

342
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
weak points are and where you need to

343
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
apply pressure and who you need to talk

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,519
to

345
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
so once you map out the city government

346
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,639
that you have

347
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
in your locality

348
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
you really are going to talk about you

349
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
know really understanding lobbying and

350
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
what is lobbying i put this kind of

351
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,959
provocative image up there and i really

352
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,480
don't mean it i actually mean the

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
opposite of it you see in the image

354
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,399
there's a money hand kind of

355
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
puppeteering uh the politician the

356
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
cartoon politician and i think this is

357
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
what people think lobbying is they think

358
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
it's like monsanto they think it's the

359
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
nra giving like a ton of money to an

360
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,639
election to a um a campaign or a

361
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
politician and that's true you know

362
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,680
that's like absolutely true but

363
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
lobbying is also something you do that

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
is just about convincing people

365
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,240
persuading people to do what you want at

366
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
the most basic level you do it in your

367
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
life all the time you know if there's a

368
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
decision that you want to be made in

369
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,839
like your friend group you're gonna

370
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
lobby you're gonna go talk to people

371
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,760
you're gonna you know organize

372
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
it's simply just persuasion um to get

373
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
you know um what you want um and there's

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
like technical stuff but there's also

375
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
just like strategy and power mapping is

376
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
a big part of that you know power

377
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,440
mapping is an old social justice like

378
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
organizing tool to figure out who the

379
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,240
powerful people are um who are the

380
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
people who you know are your opposition

381
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,959
who is um the most

382
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
invested who's the biggest stakeholder

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
once you map out the political landscape

384
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
it's pretty easy to navigate it and then

385
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
it's pretty easy to persuade the right

386
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,600
people um or neutralize the right people

387
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,240
um and so that's kind of the philosophy

388
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
of lobbying that it's just about

389
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
persuasion and understanding power but

390
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,519
then the technical stuff of like what

391
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,920
does a lobbyist actually do which is

392
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
kind of everything it's kind of whatever

393
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
it takes to get um what you want which

394
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
is a lot of management so it's like

395
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,399
getting meetings is the first thing

396
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,360
right

397
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
you know you are only as powerful as the

398
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,199
connections you have right and like

399
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,760
working at the aclu obviously it gives

400
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
you a little bit of a you know leg up

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
because you do have this kind of

402
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,360
institutional power where people will

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
trust you

404
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,079
but getting meetings and being

405
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
persistent about that is you know

406
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
absolutely necessary but then having

407
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,199
like a pitch having talking points

408
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
literally writing out talking points and

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
giving them to your coalition making

410
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
sure people stay on message

411
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
you know writing all of this out putting

412
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,839
together a detailed campaign plan

413
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
of like you know what is the timeline

414
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
what are the goals what um what is the

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,600
opposition looking like literally

416
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
managing this campaign to get what you

417
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
want which is this ordinance past

418
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
and of course the most important is

419
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
maintaining relationships you know there

420
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,120
are

421
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
a million little fires in any kind of

422
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
campaign that you have and it's really

423
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,839
kind of dumb sometimes you know

424
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,440
it's like oh this politician doesn't

425
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
like this other one they don't want to

426
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,040
be on the same bill or something or you

427
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,560
know they don't like this organization

428
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
that you're working with it's just

429
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
managing those relationships and the

430
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
kind of personal um less formal aspects

431
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
of politics is what the lobbyist job is

432
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
and now we're going to talk about

433
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,720
advocacy um

434
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,759
chris take it away yes so

435
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
and also just a quick asterisk on on

436
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,839
lobbying um

437
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,680
you can you can be a lobbyist anyone can

438
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
be a lobbyist the

439
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
especially if you're a constituent of a

440
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,120
lawmaker lawmakers need to money won't

441
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
can't buy elections they can just buy

442
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
ads

443
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
which is very useful and powerful and

444
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
like a politician's main goal is to get

445
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
reelected that's how they

446
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,959
that's how they stay in office that's

447
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
how they exercise their power and so if

448
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
you are a constituent and you go to your

449
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
council member and you say i want you to

450
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,800
i want to talk to you about this um

451
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
depending on the depe like if you're a

452
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
senator they get millions of these and

453
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,760
you'll just be one raindrop but if

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
you're i mean it's not meaningless per

455
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
se but you know all that

456
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,000
like if they get a couple hundred calls

457
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
from a constituent they'll they will

458
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
make note of that if you're like a one

459
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,039
if you're like at the city and at the

460
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,400
local level depending on the size of

461
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,439
your city

462
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,799
like

463
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,480
three or four people coming to a council

464
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
member to talk about their one issue if

465
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
they're all constituents they will pay

466
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
real close attention to that because

467
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
three or four people is a lot of people

468
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
for a city council member in a lot of in

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
a lot of cases um so you have at the

470
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,679
local level you have a lot more power

471
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
especially the folks here in this room

472
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
if you have any kind of technical

473
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
expertise and you're talking about an

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
issue that relates to your knowledge of

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
domain you're an expert you know

476
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
chances are you know more about this

477
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
stuff than they do

478
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
if they dismiss you out of hand there's

479
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,559
a good chance they

480
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,240
will get some blow back and won't get

481
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,160
reelected you can't just ignore your

482
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
constituents and expect to get reelected

483
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
um

484
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
like they're you know it's just not good

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
politics

486
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,120
they might not listen to you they might

487
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
not do what you want but they won't

488
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
ignore you or if they do then

489
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
i would suggest that you start telling

490
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,640
your neighbors that they're just blowing

491
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
you off and maybe hopefully get them out

492
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,280
of office

493
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
um so but the first step of this is like

494
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
identifying

495
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
what it is that you want to do

496
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
and for this i should like we are

497
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
focused on surveillance stuff so net and

498
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,640
surveillance technology in particular um

499
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
so obviously we're gonna we would like

500
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
it if you were doing stuff like hey we

501
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
should ban facial recognition or

502
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
government use of facial recognition we

503
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,640
should make it so that cops can't do xyz

504
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
with creepy technology why or whatever

505
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,240
but it can be broadband access it can be

506
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
um

507
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
government use of free and open source

508
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
software it can be

509
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,559
anything that you're passionate about

510
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,919
and know a lot about that you think

511
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,799
should change at the local level

512
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
looking at

513
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
and and i think another big question

514
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,400
that you need to ask yourself is do i

515
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
want to go this alone do i want to or do

516
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
i have friends that i can start like a

517
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
local group on

518
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
uh start like a local advocacy org like

519
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
neighbors for um broadband neighbors for

520
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,679
fiber access in this

521
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,760
jurisdiction um

522
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
going to and then

523
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
or do you volunteer for an existing org

524
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,520
like i

525
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
when i got started i rebooted the local

526
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
chapter of restore the fourth and i

527
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
think that that was really good for us

528
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
because restore the fourth is is like

529
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
distributed

530
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
we have chapters all throughout the

531
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,559
country right and so i was able to like

532
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,640
tap into an existing restore the fourth

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
infrastructure and volunteer list and

534
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799
get reimbursed for some expenses and all

535
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
that good jazz um you could also like

536
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,520
you can sort of start a local thing you

537
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,240
can volunteer with your local aclu or

538
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
with um like if you're based in new york

539
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
city some great organs are like the eff

540
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
or stop or this advanced technology

541
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
oversight project

542
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
um

543
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
going it alone can be good for some

544
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
local things but you're much more

545
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
powerful if you have just like a pool of

546
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
two or three of your friends who are

547
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,440
like

548
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,039
willing to every so often sit down and

549
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
brainstorm ideas for stuff

550
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
um and then doing that periodically so

551
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
once you've figured out what you want to

552
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,679
do and like sort of have a rough game

553
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,120
plan for how you're going to tackle

554
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
getting this thing passed

555
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,880
that's um that's really important if you

556
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
don't

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
you know making it big and broad and not

558
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,039
just trying to jump in to the deep end

559
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
yeah and i think that last line don't be

560
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
afraid to pivot is incredibly important

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
you know it took us close to a year and

562
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,159
a half to get this done and it wasn't

563
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,919
our original goal facial recognition was

564
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,520
not our original goal we wanted a much

565
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
broader build that encompassed facial

566
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
recognition but that created an

567
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
oversight structure so that it could

568
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
capture emerging technology and we

569
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
wouldn't have to play this game of

570
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
whack-a-mole by you know banning one

571
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
technology at a time but you know you

572
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
have this

573
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
incredible historic moment with the

574
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,559
killing of george floyd and now

575
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
everybody's attention is focused on

576
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,480
something else you have to pivot and you

577
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
have to you know rebrand and you have to

578
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
you know re-message and you know begin

579
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
again and figure out like how can i

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,159
still get something i want but in this

581
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,760
kind of new container in this new

582
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,799
vehicle in this new package

583
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah um

584
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,679
don't if you

585
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,280
if you feel like you have to go to loan

586
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
you you that's that is an option and if

587
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
you have the time and the energy and the

588
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
resources you can go to loan coalition

589
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,840
building though working with your

590
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
neighbors working with other activist

591
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
groups that is where the real power in

592
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,679
politics is that is where if you can get

593
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,039
a group like we like the safety net

594
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,400
surveillance coalition we've got like

595
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
the aclu restore the fourth obviously

596
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,200
are two args but there's also

597
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
communities united against police

598
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
brutality there's a council on american

599
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,159
islamic relations there's um

600
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
i am uh

601
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,520
jewish community action there's just a

602
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
whole bunch of other

603
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,039
and i'm sure that they all get mad at me

604
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
for forgetting the names of their orgs

605
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
but if you go like on our website you

606
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,159
can see like there's a like i think

607
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,760
there's eight eight different orgs that

608
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
regularly attend our meetings and they

609
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
don't even necessarily have to be

610
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,000
directly related to the advocacy topic

611
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
that you're talking about if they're

612
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,159
willing to

613
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,640
just sort of sign on to a letter for

614
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,080
especially like with civil rights stuff

615
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
just because

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,919
when you get a bunch of these different

617
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
works together you can pull resources

618
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
and all these big name orgs signing on

619
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,840
to an open letter it's

620
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
it's much more powerful than even if you

621
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
are an expert just just you going to

622
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
talk to your council member yeah and we

623
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,159
have to think about building

624
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
relationships again which is kind of the

625
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
main thing right so who do you need to

626
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
build a relationship with who will give

627
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
you the most leverage you know and don't

628
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,840
be afraid to be like calculating you

629
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,760
know if a particular council member

630
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,320
looks like this certain organization

631
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
make sure you're friendly with that

632
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
organization maybe get them on your

633
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,080
coalition you know build a team that

634
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,000
will help you achieve your goals really

635
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,159
um and we do have like a little

636
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,880
coalition explainer so if you guys go um

637
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
on the website i think we have this

638
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,760
slide i'll upload this slide deck onto

639
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
the hope wiki too so right yeah so

640
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,280
there's a good little primer and

641
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
explainer on coalition uh building 101.

642
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
i can talk about community engagement so

643
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,919
community engagement is obviously going

644
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,840
to be incredibly important it's kind of

645
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
the organizing tool that you have and

646
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,320
it's going to be when you go public

647
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
right and it's really important that

648
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
like when you come to the

649
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
time that you have to go public that you

650
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,000
have to build support that you have to

651
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,159
mobilize kind of a base

652
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,480
that will be vocal and loud you really

653
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
have to get into community engagement

654
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
and the first thing when we're talking

655
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
about especially surveillance data

656
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
privacy tech digital rights

657
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
we're kind of working with the knowledge

658
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,279
gap and we're working with

659
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
you know accessibility issues and it's

660
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,039
like does the public even understand

661
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
your issue do they know the ins and outs

662
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
of it do they care

663
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
and this is all when organizing comes

664
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,760
into it and you can do like a variety of

665
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
things you know you can have town halls

666
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,080
you can have little park discussions you

667
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,960
can

668
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
do some press some social media you know

669
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,559
get a twitter page going just how are

670
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,080
you connecting with people how are you

671
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
talking to people and do they even know

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
about you are you a presence in your

673
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,480
community um you know and this is kind

674
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,919
of where you live or die you know by um

675
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,320
because you can't do it on alone when

676
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
you're talking about municipal politics

677
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,279
anyone that is a lone actor is you know

678
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
considered suspicious nobody's gonna

679
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,080
listen to you it is only you know you

680
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
have to have people that vouch for you

681
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,480
and having a packed council room of just

682
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,039
like regular people that work a

683
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,120
nine-to-five is incredibly powerful

684
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,159
and

685
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
like community organizing doing outreach

686
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
that thing not my skill set

687
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
i very when when we started this

688
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,919
coalition

689
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,440
um it's

690
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
is like i

691
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
reached out to a bunch of folks at the

692
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,320
aclu and just kept

693
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,480
you know aclu gets a lot of emails and i

694
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
just kept bugging them until i got a

695
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
meeting with awesome

696
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
um and eventually me and curtis are my

697
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
co-chair at restore the fourth we just

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,919
we got a meeting with someone from the

699
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,919
aclu he's like we've got this model bill

700
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,200
that we want to push we've got a couple

701
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
other orgs we've signed on to it we're

702
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
just we want to push for this and

703
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,039
um

704
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,880
like the aclu and the other orgs in the

705
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
coalition are the ones with the massive

706
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
list serves and they you know they did a

707
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,200
lot of that and restore the fourth and

708
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,559
are sort of my

709
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,960
what i sort of see is my role is

710
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
um the

711
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,520
all of the infrastructure for um the

712
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,600
website that we put up like um when we

713
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
do

714
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,039
we often run the tech background when we

715
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
do public meetings and stuff like that

716
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,840
um

717
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
the

718
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,559
it is uh

719
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,559
it's not

720
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,440
necessarily how important it is to do

721
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
that community engagement stuff you

722
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,440
if you can find someone who's better at

723
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,760
that than you and lean on them while you

724
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,679
handle a lot of the back like the

725
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
hosting and the expertise and to help

726
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
you with the language don't necessarily

727
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
feel like you specifically have to do

728
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,600
all of the community engagement if you

729
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
can find someone who's better at that

730
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
than you are um

731
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
have them do it

732
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,919
um

733
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
but and there are there are specific

734
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,440
ways that a technologist can help out

735
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
these kinds of communities like the big

736
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
one for me is it's it is astonishing to

737
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
me how often local community groups have

738
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,880
a thing that they are pushing and they

739
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,520
don't have a dedicated website to push

740
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,840
for that topic um

741
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
fight for the future is a is like a

742
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
national org that's very good about like

743
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
setting up individual websites for their

744
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
individual

745
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
campaign pushes and that's like it's not

746
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,200
that hard to buy a domain and set up a

747
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
website we know how to do this stuff um

748
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,679
the other thing the big thing is being

749
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,520
the expert in the room knowing all the

750
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,679
technical ins and outs and being able to

751
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,919
explain to anonyx this is the tricky

752
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,840
part is usually just explaining the

753
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
diffic the complicated technical thing

754
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,640
to the person who is the technical

755
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
expert i mean that's why like helping to

756
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
build the website and making sure that

757
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,679
everything's clear on the website it's

758
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,799
very useful infrastructure

759
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,240
you know just setting site helping and

760
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,720
setting up that digital infrastructure

761
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
i put down fixing printers basic i.t

762
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,039
stuff because uh a lot of groups like

763
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,200
the aclu and other community orgs if you

764
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
volunt they uh they usually don't have

765
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,240
dedicated i.t staff never mind

766
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
like security professionals

767
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,200
so if you are um

768
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
if you can do that stuff for them i

769
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
guaran they would probably be very

770
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,600
interested in in accepting that help

771
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
the last one i put down is adversarial

772
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
tech this is uh in my mind things like

773
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
uh croc hunter which is like a raspberry

774
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,320
pi that helps you detect

775
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,000
stingrays there's there's interesting

776
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,279
there are interesting apps and

777
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,640
interesting technologies that you can

778
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
use and help develop that will help

779
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
whatever thing that you're pushing for

780
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,159
but as a rule i find techno solution

781
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,080
the universe of actual like

782
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
technological solutions to like local

783
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,679
organizing problems is actually fairly

784
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
small it's better to

785
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
when you're trying to exercise political

786
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
power it's better to do that through

787
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,320
community organizing and through helping

788
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
and through like getting those local law

789
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
paths rather than trying to develop an

790
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,720
app

791
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,919
um and then trying to get all of your

792
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
neighbors to install it or something um

793
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
if you're gonna do tech if you're gonna

794
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,240
like help out with tech stuff it's

795
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
important to listen to whoever it is

796
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,760
that you're partnering with

797
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,200
um so

798
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,679
yeah and i see it really as a symbiotic

799
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
relationship that again has to be

800
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,279
maintained so

801
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,360
we're talking about like coalitions and

802
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
i'll get into the problems um later but

803
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,039
when we're talking about coalitions

804
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,320
they're going to be different people and

805
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
having technologists like chris is

806
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,520
incredibly important right but people

807
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
like you know

808
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,360
we all have a kind of um

809
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,080
you know our strengths and weaknesses

810
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,880
um so if i'm like the lobbyist on the

811
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,960
coalition you know i'm gonna make sure i

812
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,320
get the meetings i'm gonna make sure

813
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,559
people stay on message i'm gonna and

814
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,080
then i'll just throw to chris for like

815
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
the technical stuff and like the really

816
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
explaining like what is the issue here

817
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
so it should be a symbiotic relationship

818
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,000
where people have their role people play

819
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,039
their part um and don't really bogart or

820
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,039
like go into other areas because then

821
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,919
it's just not you know effective um and

822
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,760
chris is right you know if there was an

823
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
app to solve everything that would be

824
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,720
great um

825
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,960
but there isn't and it's gonna take like

826
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
a lot of like messy political like work

827
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,720
and organizing work to get it done

828
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
um and i want to take a minute now to

829
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,399
talk about the pitfalls and problems i

830
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,080
feel like we've been painting a pretty

831
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
rosy picture about municipal politics

832
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
but it isn't easy

833
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,440
um and i think the problems that i want

834
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
to highlight one

835
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,679
the jurisdiction right if you have a

836
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,600
smaller jurisdiction there's going to be

837
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
loopholes there's going to be limited

838
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,600
impact for example we passed a facial

839
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
recognition ban but

840
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
does that solve the problem of police

841
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
using facial recognition it doesn't we

842
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
still have the share you know the

843
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,039
sheriffs we still have the county we

844
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,200
still have the state we have all these

845
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
kind of you know

846
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
opaque agencies we have the fusion

847
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,919
centers there's so many points of data

848
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,279
sharing that really working at like one

849
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,679
city is not going to solve the issue of

850
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,559
facial recognition um and surveillance

851
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,000
right so

852
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,320
but the idea is that you are you know

853
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,559
scaling this upwards which i think we'll

854
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
talk about later so that if you

855
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,480
for example if you pass a facial

856
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
recognition ban in minneapolis and st

857
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,279
paul that's like the metro area right

858
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,919
that's a lot of people that's like 55 of

859
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
the people in the state live there

860
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,760
that's a mandate that's a mandate that

861
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,200
you can then take to the state

862
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
legislature and say look at what we did

863
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,919
in minneapolis and saint paul and then

864
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,840
take that work product take that

865
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
organizing pace take that people power

866
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
and scale upwards to the state and

867
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
hopefully nationally right so

868
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,279
while it is a limited impact and it

869
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,039
isn't a panacea it's not gonna solve

870
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,279
everything it's the momentum it's the

871
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,679
like one step out of time and it's kind

872
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
of building up from the ground right um

873
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,399
i think another problem is coalitions

874
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
right coalitions are incredibly messy

875
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
they're incredibly fragile it's just a

876
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
lot of interpersonal conflict and

877
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
 that you have to navigate

878
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,960
through just to get to like the work and

879
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
then there's just like keeping um a

880
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,799
coalition of people that this isn't

881
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,480
their day job they're not getting paid

882
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
for this you know they're volunteering

883
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
their time

884
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,240
and how do you keep momentum over a year

885
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,919
over two years that you're trying to

886
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,679
pass this bill

887
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
and you've got to keep this coalition

888
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,240
intact you know and then there's also

889
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
the um

890
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
the really really large issue that when

891
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,000
you're talking about surveillance and

892
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
these kind of tech

893
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
tools you're talking about taking tools

894
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,919
away from the police and as we've seen

895
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,440
um i feel like we're kind of living

896
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,799
through a backlash of 2020 and

897
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,279
i feel like the middle class the white

898
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,519
middle class has been incredibly spooked

899
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,760
right if you even mention police reform

900
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,880
it's it's equated to abolition you know

901
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,360
and once you hear that you know you're

902
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,840
taking a tool away from the police to do

903
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,240
their jobs that's incredibly powerful

904
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,000
talking point and that's one that you're

905
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
going to have to constantly fight

906
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
against

907
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,760
so law enforcement opposition obviously

908
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,360
a huge barrier

909
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,399
um

910
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,919
and i think the lastly it's like

911
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,720
lawmakers lack knowledge of like

912
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,440
technical surveillance data issues i

913
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
mean a lot of cities don't even have

914
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,679
like um uh like i.t or technical officer

915
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,519
um i think we just got one in

916
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
minneapolis um and we have the issue of

917
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
like is surveillance even like a

918
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,559
campaign platform issue you know once we

919
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
go to these lawmakers these council

920
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,200
members these senators um

921
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,480
you know they'll be like oh my

922
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,559
constituents don't talk to me about that

923
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,720
when i go for election nobody asked me

924
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
about that there's no questionnaires

925
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
about this there's no debates about this

926
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,120
like why is this an issue you know and

927
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,720
if they don't see that like people

928
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
asking questions about surveillance data

929
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
privacy tech digital civil rights um you

930
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
know it's not an issue it's a non-issue

931
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
um so it's like lack of knowledge and

932
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,200
lack of awareness

933
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
and these are things problems you'll

934
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
have to just like constantly manage

935
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,440
throughout the life of this campaign

936
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,039
but now to look forward and to maybe ask

937
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,559
some broader questions about like what

938
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,840
we're trying to do here

939
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,559
um so chris if you want to go through

940
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,039
like other potential policy areas um

941
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,559
beyond facial recognition like i

942
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,640
mentioned earlier the um

943
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,240
there's a whole the list of policy areas

944
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,679
bruce schneider has this great i think

945
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,679
it's a defcon talk

946
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,960
you know the need for public interest

947
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,039
technologists everything is becoming a

948
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
computer and so like everything

949
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,519
everything that is policy has like a

950
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,480
good technological component to it and

951
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
the idea uh you know

952
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
there's a great book called um code is

953
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
lawn by lawrence lessig and all this

954
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,279
goes up there's

955
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,519
like a gajillion different areas like

956
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,120
our thing is surveillance and technology

957
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
but there's a gazillion different areas

958
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
that as technologists we have an

959
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
interest in um the criminalization of

960
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
security research is a big one just

961
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
generic consumer

962
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,320
consumer privacy like the calif

963
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
like the many states are working on like

964
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,040
their state version of the gdpr um

965
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
there's like a really terrible microsoft

966
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,079
bill that keeps getting pushed in

967
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,760
different states maybe you could just

968
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
fight fight against that and like push

969
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
for a consumer privacy bill that

970
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
actually has

971
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,159
meaningful teeth to it there's right to

972
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,280
repair there's a whole bunch of

973
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
different talks at this conference

974
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,399
talking about the importance of right to

975
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,760
repair and that's a big

976
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,560
um another great bipartisan sort of you

977
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,399
know farmers we should be able to fix

978
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,239
their own freaking tractors and whatever

979
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,399
um there's section 230 and fisa like

980
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
these

981
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,760
mass national surveillance you know

982
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
robotics climate change food safety ai

983
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,359
bio engineering there's like a gazillion

984
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,399
different topics that if you're

985
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,239
interested in you can probably find a

986
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,079
way to advocate for change just at the

987
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
local or count to your state level um

988
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
obviously we care about surveillance and

989
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
surveillance technology but if you're

990
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,599
passionate about

991
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,960
hey your

992
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
local city you should be using more free

993
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,640
and open source software there's a whole

994
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,000
community of people out here who will

995
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,160
help you do your stuff if you just like

996
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
stopped relying on microsoft to be your

997
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
vendors or whatever you can push for

998
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,960
that and i bet they would be very

999
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
interested in the fact that they can use

1000
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
free software as in they're probably

1001
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,240
more interested in the freeze and free

1002
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,200
beer but you know whatever

1003
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,320
so to ask the big questions why aren't

1004
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,640
there more coalitions like this why

1005
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
isn't there just like an abundance of

1006
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
tech at digital rights coalitions why

1007
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,839
isn't this like an issue at the local

1008
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
level for everyday people considering

1009
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,599
we're all on the internet we all use

1010
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,640
technology it's just like a omnipresent

1011
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
factor of our lives and yet you know

1012
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,440
when i look at like the political

1013
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,920
landscape in cities it's just a it's a

1014
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
lot of you know labor unions police

1015
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
reform

1016
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,119
groups

1017
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,440
but not a lot focusing on surveillance

1018
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
and data and i think the reasons for

1019
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,680
this of like why this issue is so scarce

1020
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
at the grassroots level is that

1021
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
obviously it feels really large but that

1022
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,440
there's just like a knowledge gap and

1023
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,599
that the social awareness isn't there

1024
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,119
you know um

1025
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
it's i think when you're being spied on

1026
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
it feels

1027
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
uh like it's just like in the back of

1028
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
your mind it's not an immediate concern

1029
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
it's not like it's not a it doesn't

1030
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
equate to like the cop pointing a gun at

1031
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,599
your face yeah it's like

1032
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,839
smog right it's like this background

1033
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
thing that harms you not not in the

1034
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
media it's just like this constant

1035
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,079
background thing that you notice from

1036
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,240
time to time and it's slowly poisoning

1037
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,079
your lungs and giving you cancer like

1038
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
the harm is not immediate and felt but

1039
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,480
like violations of privacy and constant

1040
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,640
state surveillance there are real costs

1041
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,560
to our freedoms and our civil liberties

1042
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,839
um

1043
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,480
it's just not as acute and so it doesn't

1044
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
feel as urgent yeah and i think the

1045
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,880
solution really is forming ourselves in

1046
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,200
these collectives and demanding that

1047
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
this gets awareness and demanding that

1048
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
these issues be addressed you know and

1049
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,359
really exercising political power making

1050
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,160
sure we pull our resources together

1051
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,400
which is another huge like uh boon of

1052
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
just having people together is that you

1053
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
have more resources you have more money

1054
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,839
you have more power

1055
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,599
and what you really get is popular

1056
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,079
support right um instead of this being a

1057
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,760
niche issue instead of this being in the

1058
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
background you know like the smog that

1059
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
chris said this is in the forefront of

1060
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
people's minds and we can you know

1061
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,400
fabricate that demand if people

1062
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
we can organize for that demand and we

1063
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
can make that clear you know and we can

1064
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
bring hackers together we can bring

1065
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
non-profits together we can bring the

1066
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,200
organizer on the streets together labor

1067
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,839
unions small businesses you know it's

1068
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,160
really once we're at like the nexus of

1069
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
all of these

1070
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
people and these collectives and these

1071
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,520
groups that we can actually move things

1072
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,400
and we can create change

1073
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
um yeah so i think this is optimistic

1074
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,240
but what we're really trying to do is a

1075
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,640
digital revolution from the ground up

1076
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,280
and really like i said just increasing

1077
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
the consciousness even if you don't get

1078
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
anything done you don't get the bill

1079
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,800
passed you don't get the ordinance pass

1080
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,359
you know you don't get that budget that

1081
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
you wanted

1082
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
just putting this on the map for

1083
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,200
everyday people is an incredible benefit

1084
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,680
and it's a win for everybody right

1085
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
having you know the starbucks worker or

1086
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,320
the target worker care about

1087
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,560
surveillance and data privacy is

1088
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,640
incredibly useful for like a national

1089
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,599
org that's working with the congressmen

1090
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,760
local bases are really how change is

1091
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
made and how mass movements come

1092
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,680
together and it's how you get national

1093
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
and global wins you know from the bottom

1094
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
up

1095
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
so thank you for listening to that we're

1096
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
going to do a little power mapping

1097
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
exercise and we'll also do some q a

1098
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,960
while we're at it yeah um so actually

1099
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,079
let's let's quick swap here

1100
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,839
but i think

1101
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,000
what i what i want to do is sort of just

1102
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,560
highlight uh

1103
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
go go through the process of doing some

1104
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
power mapping which is or like sort of

1105
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,919
what i do when um

1106
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
oh boy i'm not used to apple stuff but

1107
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
let's see how fun this is

1108
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
um so basically i just wanted to give

1109
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,640
the let's see the process my process of

1110
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,920
doing power mapping power map is going

1111
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
to be different for everybody i lost the

1112
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,560
thread oh no

1113
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,560
okay there it is but um

1114
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,040
no oh no it's not there yeah i lost the

1115
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,520
slides

1116
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,079
i don't know anything about apple

1117
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,599
um

1118
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,760
essentially it's ocean you find

1119
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,440
find your google your freaking city

1120
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,280
council

1121
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,640
and then

1122
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,680
make a list of all the council members

1123
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,200
and then

1124
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,720
copy paste our names onto a document you

1125
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
can do this right now i'm going to do it

1126
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,160
right now

1127
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
actually there is let's see

1128
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,520
best buy is based in

1129
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
minnesota

1130
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,160
there we go where is best spy based

1131
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,480
looks like it's based in

1132
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,240
richfield okay

1133
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
richfield

1134
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,720
mitchfield city council members

1135
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,399
behold the magic of

1136
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,960
activism this is what some people get

1137
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
paid millions of dollars

1138
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,760
a year to do

1139
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,880
i don't actually know if that's true

1140
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,800
enough it's true people do get paid an

1141
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
inordinate amount of money to do this

1142
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
and they really don't need to and you

1143
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,680
can do it too

1144
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,359
um but so basically i shouldn't be paid

1145
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,319
to do this

1146
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,000
normally i'd pull up a notepad and

1147
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,240
literally just copy paste all of these

1148
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,760
people's their names and their contact

1149
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,240
information into into a document so

1150
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
the mayor is probably very powerful

1151
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,359
let's just

1152
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,520
the next step the next step generally is

1153
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,839
find their campaign website because what

1154
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,119
we're looking for right now is we're

1155
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,480
looking for

1156
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,400
us we're assuming that we've decided on

1157
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,319
something that we want to pass a facial

1158
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,319
recognition ban you know

1159
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,839
you've already got in mind what you're

1160
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,359
what you want to do but now we're

1161
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,680
looking for like a hero a

1162
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,000
someone to introduce or to be like your

1163
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,079
primary point of contact so let's

1164
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,040
look up this mayor

1165
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,720
well

1166
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,520
um if folks so yeah this is basically

1167
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
the process mayor

1168
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,640
campaign website

1169
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,319
cool uh

1170
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,960
oh interesting

1171
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,890
so she's not going to

1172
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,720
[Music]

1173
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
she's not going to seek re-election okay

1174
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,200
so she's probably then

1175
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,480
i would just note that she's not seeking

1176
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,319
the election so

1177
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,839
literally like what i'm doing right now

1178
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,040
going through and googling every single

1179
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,960
freaking council member and noting down

1180
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,560
their contact information for later this

1181
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
is the process

1182
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,520
yeah um

1183
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
i guess does anyone have any uh

1184
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,599
does anyone have any questions for us

1185
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,440
well before we get into that i would

1186
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,920
like to show just like one image

1187
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,680
i would like to show just one image of

1188
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
like what power mapping actually looks

1189
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,400
like

1190
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
so like one

1191
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,480
yeah

1192
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,720
let's see if we can

1193
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,599
so

1194
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,440
this grid right here is kind of a

1195
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,280
classic example

1196
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,000
of like what power mapping is um i don't

1197
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,319
know if people can see it but

1198
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,040
it's put into like four quarters right

1199
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,800
and at the top is like who is most

1200
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,680
influential who is most powerful at the

1201
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,760
bottom who is least powerful who is

1202
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,160
least influential on the sides who's

1203
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,319
strongly opposed to you and on the other

1204
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,800
side who strongly supports you and what

1205
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
you do is literally get the stakeholders

1206
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,440
your target the council members um you

1207
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,520
know the organizations just whoever is a

1208
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,920
person of interest and you literally

1209
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
plop them down on this and it's a way of

1210
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,720
visualizing the political landscape

1211
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,319
and it's a pretty old tool that people

1212
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,640
use

1213
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
so yeah that's pretty much it that's

1214
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,079
where we're gonna talk

1215
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,240
i think we can open it for questions and

1216
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,800
answers i'm really interested to see

1217
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,839
um

1218
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,200
what people are interested in talking

1219
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,640
about

1220
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,400
and i think we've got a lot of time too

1221
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,319
yeah yeah and the thing i guess that if

1222
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,079
i could have some

1223
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,599
if yeah

1224
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,040
yeah

1225
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,319
the thing that i guess i kind of want to

1226
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,920
highlight is that you can do this i'm

1227
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
not like i did not start this whole

1228
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,960
process

1229
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,480
knowing anything about anything it just

1230
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,200
took

1231
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,319
sort of research and learning from

1232
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,760
scratch and

1233
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,040
every content you know your local

1234
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,960
context is going to be different but

1235
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,720
just get started and be persistent with

1236
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,400
it and apply the skills that you already

1237
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
have to the problem at hand and

1238
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,319
just keep at it and you'll be i think

1239
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,839
you'll be more successful than than you

1240
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,599
might think at first so

1241
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,520
words of encouragement all right it

1242
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,240
looks like we have a question go ahead

1243
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,720
hi um so first of all i wanted to uh

1244
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,880
share support and uh and congratulations

1245
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,599
from uh from france uh i'm part of a

1246
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,440
group based in uh in france where we've

1247
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,800
been doing a similar campaign on a

1248
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,000
national level

1249
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,839
called techno police which is trying to

1250
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,720
like

1251
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,319
give um help local groups get the tools

1252
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,160
to do what you've been doing and so i'm

1253
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,839
really excited to see you doing it like

1254
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,280
in somewhere else

1255
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,119
so my two questions would be

1256
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,720
have you been in contact with other

1257
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,400
people in other cities to sort of

1258
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,160
exchange tips and tricks it's

1259
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,200
interesting what you were mentioning

1260
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,359
about u.s local politics being so

1261
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,680
different from one city to the next i

1262
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,440
don't i don't think that maps back on to

1263
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,960
france and into europe in general where

1264
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,280
it's maybe more usually like the same

1265
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,520
setup everywhere um but so so you know

1266
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,920
have you been able to do that and um

1267
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,200
when i see this sort of stuff i get

1268
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
excited about oh oh we should all work

1269
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,480
together at sort of like a you know

1270
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,160
supranational level like all get

1271
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,640
together and share more information and

1272
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,440
more sort of motivation and tools um you

1273
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
were mentioning and i entirely agree

1274
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,280
coalitions are hard and they're messy

1275
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,400
so

1276
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
an international coalition sounds even

1277
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,680
harder but if it's on specific things

1278
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,440
like you know literally

1279
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,280
civilians in the streets gate

1280
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,359
recognition you know microphones facial

1281
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,119
recognition these are exactly the thing

1282
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,560
that this campaign the one i'm talking

1283
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,839
about um back in france called

1284
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,839
technopolis has been doing like it

1285
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,000
sounds like it's easier to build bridges

1286
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,760
when you're literally on the same issues

1287
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,000
and working on you know against the same

1288
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,079
industrial complexes that are trying to

1289
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,599
push this technology locally because

1290
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,040
they make money from it and all that so

1291
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,560
yeah those are my two questions i guess

1292
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,760
what i would what i would say is um

1293
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,680
the the easiest thing

1294
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,520
like how to plug into like national

1295
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,920
international efforts there is if the

1296
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,520
electronic frontier foundation has this

1297
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,880
fantastic initiative called the

1298
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
electronic frontier alliance

1299
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,440
and if you start a local

1300
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
organization dedicated to a pro and you

1301
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,760
agree with the electronic frontier sort

1302
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
of generic goals and aims which i would

1303
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,400
suspect that most of us here do then

1304
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,839
join you can join the electronic

1305
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,200
frontier alliance and your org will be

1306
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,560
listed on this big list and you can go

1307
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,480
to these monthly meetings where like

1308
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
they will have organizers from the eff

1309
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,079
on the zoom call and you can chat with

1310
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,680
them and share resources and they have

1311
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,599
trainings and all this useful stuff the

1312
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,160
other thing is to just once you've got

1313
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,599
once once you have a little bit of an

1314
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,200
organization at the local level and you

1315
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,640
obviously already do but just like

1316
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,480
literally reaching out to these other

1317
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,079
orgs find their contact information

1318
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,599
reach out and say hey do you have

1319
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,040
anything can we join can we is there

1320
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,640
anything that we can do to help um the

1321
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,839
other thing is like

1322
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,440
you don't have to agree about everything

1323
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,880
to be part of a coalition together

1324
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
restore the fourth is

1325
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,960
as a rule a very sort of libertarian

1326
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,119
right meaning or this isn't true in all

1327
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,400
cases but like

1328
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,160
there is a there is especially on issues

1329
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,520
of surveillance and technology there is

1330
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,839
a lot more overlap between the left and

1331
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,000
the right on on these issues than than

1332
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,960
you might think and um

1333
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,520
you know you don't have to agree 100

1334
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,960
with what the other coalition partners

1335
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,480
are up to if you just agree on the

1336
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,319
policy that you're fighting for you can

1337
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,680
be in a coalition together on that

1338
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,720
policy

1339
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,319
don't don't be afraid to like work with

1340
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,400
people that you disagree with 90 of the

1341
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,920
time on other stuff if they agree with

1342
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,880
you on the stuff that you're fighting

1343
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
for

1344
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,079
work with them on that one thing

1345
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,280
yeah and if we're talking about just

1346
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,119
like other cities like the neighboring

1347
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,960
city i think what you need to do is like

1348
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,119
monitor and do some lurking of social

1349
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,280
media for example if there's like a big

1350
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,839
issue in your locality um you know i

1351
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,640
don't know like trash like sanitation i

1352
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,800
don't know any issue who is speaking up

1353
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,000
about it who is organizing around it who

1354
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,160
is like sending out flyers around it

1355
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
figuring out who is actually in the

1356
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
playing field for any kind of certain

1357
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
issue and then just like literally

1358
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
reaching out to them as he said but i

1359
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,760
think that the internet and social media

1360
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,520
is such a huge help for figuring out who

1361
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,839
these personalities actually are this is

1362
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
where like social media scraping and

1363
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,280
using bots is very useful if you know

1364
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,319
how to do if you know how to do that

1365
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,160
kind of thing and systematically monitor

1366
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,599
these things using your own kind of

1367
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,720
social media surveillance tools um

1368
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,160
you can you know

1369
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,599
use those tools against the state to

1370
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,640
figure out

1371
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,119
who your potential allies are

1372
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,559
thank you though that sounds pretty

1373
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,240
amazing though you said you're from

1374
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,400
france again yeah lovely thank you for

1375
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,960
your question

1376
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
hello oh

1377
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,040
thanks for the presentation uh so

1378
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,800
reading through the law sometimes feels

1379
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
like kind of looking at spaghetti code

1380
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,520
and uh i think that a part of that is

1381
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
because it's very waterfally the the

1382
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,960
ways in which we kind of build the

1383
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,480
legislation that kind of governs our

1384
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,960
lives and i'm wondering how you all feel

1385
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,520
about the approach of adopting more open

1386
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,760
source software kind of tenants when it

1387
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,480
comes to the management of our law like

1388
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,720
is there a possibility that one day an

1389
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,040
industrious person could like

1390
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,720
file a pull request against the

1391
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
legislation that governs their

1392
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,319
municipality and have like an open

1393
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,240
conversation about what that means and

1394
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,400
whether or not it's adoptable or is that

1395
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,319
too far away from how we usually think

1396
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,000
about like representative democracy in

1397
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,480
this country

1398
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,200
i agree with the premise of your

1399
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,599
question very very strongly um

1400
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,880
i still to this day get very frustrated

1401
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,040
and angry at lawyers for using words in

1402
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,440
ways that don't make sense

1403
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,960
it seems like they have their own

1404
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
separate language for stuff it just

1405
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,520
it just takes time to sort of parse

1406
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,960
through and by asking a lot of folks

1407
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,400
like the asu you are like just local

1408
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,559
lawyers and like does it what does this

1409
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,079
what does this mean in the legal context

1410
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,160
is there like case law is there like why

1411
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,160
are what are all these whereas is for um

1412
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,119
but

1413
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,559
what i would say is

1414
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,240
definitely yes there is there is an

1415
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,599
opportunity for that at the local level

1416
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,359
especially if you can find

1417
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,040
if you can find a council member or if

1418
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,119
you can find a bureaucrat who you can

1419
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,720
get to agree with you about what you

1420
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,440
just said and you are willing to put in

1421
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,520
the time to

1422
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,200
you're going to probably have to do most

1423
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,640
of like the behind the scenes heavy

1424
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,880
lifting to be like when you go to a city

1425
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,960
council like a lot of like

1426
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,000
we we came with language prefabricated

1427
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,240
for our ordinance we like we did a lot

1428
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,440
of them and then they took it and then

1429
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,720
they sort of remixed it and then they

1430
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,319
reached like

1431
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,720
if for for issues like for a lot

1432
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,160
especially if they're a small

1433
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,760
municipality you're gonna

1434
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,839
and anticipate doing a lot of that sort

1435
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,680
of behind the scenes leg work

1436
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,480
but

1437
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,839
if you can find someone on your couch

1438
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,680
who is interested in that then yes there

1439
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,920
is an opportunity for that and the more

1440
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,240
municipalities that do stuff like that

1441
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,720
it will trickle up like there's

1442
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,160
i've lost track there's more than 20

1443
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,200
different cities now that have banned

1444
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,880
facial recognition right like i think

1445
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,960
it's actually getting down to 30. and

1446
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,720
there's a reason why like there are

1447
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,000
bills in congress and there are bills in

1448
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,359
state legislatures talking about banning

1449
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,480
facial recognition because there are

1450
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
multiple municipal jurisdictions with

1451
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,280
covering millions of people um so like

1452
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,880
it matters when you get these stuff

1453
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
passed through at the local level so

1454
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,079
yeah there is an opportunity for it i

1455
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,160
say go for it i look forward to the day

1456
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,480
i can like fork the facial recognition

1457
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,400
law and be like hey we want this here

1458
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,079
like that yeah and i know i think it's

1459
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,760
i i i don't know expect money to know

1460
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,599
but like i'm pretty sure in dc there is

1461
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,160
like an actual github of the of their

1462
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,240
municipal codes it's it's not outside

1463
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,000
the realm of house like getting them to

1464
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,520
actually refactor the language of the

1465
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
ordinances in a way that is like

1466
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,599
readable to people who aren't lawyers is

1467
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,839
a much harder lift i think but

1468
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,079
it should be doable

1469
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,839
yeah i think that's a terrific idea and

1470
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,040
it's definitely one you're gonna have to

1471
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,000
lobby and organize to get done but

1472
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,520
you have to do that because i think the

1473
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,680
language the legal jargon that's a

1474
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,920
political decision right that's a

1475
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,599
political decision to make law

1476
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,520
unreadable to make this legislation

1477
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,920
unreadable to make it that you can hide

1478
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,839
 in it you know that is a political

1479
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,200
decision and you have to change that and

1480
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
i mean you'll face a lot of opposition

1481
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,720
because you know there's a lot of money

1482
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
at stake um

1483
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,599
but

1484
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,599
you can like start to build that

1485
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,480
political will um and start to you know

1486
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,559
one little city at a time and then if it

1487
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,960
works you know it catches on like

1488
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,280
wildfire but i just do want to highlight

1489
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,280
like yeah that's you're fighting against

1490
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,480
like you know political decisions um

1491
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,359
you know

1492
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,119
that are not done in good faith i think

1493
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,880
yeah i appreciate it thank you that was

1494
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,359
great thank you

1495
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,879
together

1496
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,880
we need to wrap this up to get ready for

1497
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,640
the next session thank you but so we do

1498
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,880
have time for okay so

1499
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,400
covid

1500
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,000
um so i tried to interact with

1501
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,720
new york city government over a minor

1502
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
issue i had and i had been very

1503
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,800
successful in the past

1504
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,359
but long after they

1505
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,680
said the city is open enjoyed the city

1506
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,720
no government agencies or for

1507
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,440
advocacy agencies were open

1508
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,640
no city council they were all closed and

1509
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,200
apparently covert also prevented them

1510
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,880
from returning any phone calls or

1511
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,720
writing any emails

1512
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,599
so

1513
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,280
and it seemed clear to me after a few

1514
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,119
weeks which by the way i never got my

1515
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,920
problem solved that this was seemed to

1516
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,720
be a bulletproof excuse for them to not

1517
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,359
interact with their constituents

1518
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,000
did anybody else did you experience that

1519
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
what any suggestions about what to do

1520
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,520
about that

1521
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,839
yes thank you for bringing that up covet

1522
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,160
has made a political lobbying and

1523
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,960
organizing so much worse right it gives

1524
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,520
them the politicians excuse to hide from

1525
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,079
you for example our state legislature

1526
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,920
you know was like just not in session

1527
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,319
for i think like two years almost and

1528
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
what happens is like you know lobbying

1529
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
is being in the lobby right it's just

1530
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,960
physically being there being a pest

1531
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,200
being in their face but what we have is

1532
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,040
that these lawmakers are now hiding you

1533
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,599
know behind these like zoom meetings uh

1534
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,000
behind you know we just can't physically

1535
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,400
meet up so i'm not gonna um hear your

1536
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,040
issue and i think what we did was just

1537
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,440
literally just constantly do everything

1538
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
virtually right so a ton of zoom

1539
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,880
meetings a ton of emails a ton of calls

1540
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,319
and just literally non-stop relentless

1541
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,559
like bothering them to the point that

1542
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,839
they just like

1543
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,319
relinquish you know their

1544
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,920
any kind of fight that they have against

1545
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,520
you um so i think just being incredibly

1546
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
annoying and pestering and really kind

1547
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,400
of threatening too like not like in a

1548
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,520
you know

1549
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,200
violent way but just being like hey

1550
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,040
you're not listening to me you're using

1551
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,359
these evasive tactics and i will let

1552
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,040
people know i'm gonna take this public

1553
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,880
that you're doing this you know and i

1554
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,000
will get together with other

1555
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,559
constituents you know make such a fuss

1556
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,400
that they have to look at you

1557
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,760
yeah and

1558
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,200
it's it's

1559
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,720
it is a bit of a

1560
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,000
i really don't like schlepping down to

1561
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,400
the capitol to to stand in the lobby to

1562
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,920
to do that kind of thing that's just

1563
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,359
mostly because you know

1564
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,960
i'm anti-social i don't like talking to

1565
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,960
people face to face i actually like the

1566
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,400
zoom the zoom meetings and i kind of

1567
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,880
prefer it that way and also it also you

1568
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,480
know it feels nice to know that i'm on a

1569
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,079
level playing field with the paid aclu

1570
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,160
lobbyist or the paid monsanto lobbyist

1571
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,160
or whatever they they got to do meetings

1572
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,400
i got to do some meetings i don't know

1573
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,799
this you do it does level the playing

1574
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,440
field a little bit in that sense but it

1575
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,119
just

1576
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,520
like manure said being very persistent

1577
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,119
and and

1578
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,599
it's not going to be as impactful having

1579
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,760
like six or seven neighbors in the zoo

1580
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,680
meeting as it is to crowd their office

1581
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,280
with six or seven people but if you

1582
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,440
don't get that zoom meeting

1583
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,839
you know

1584
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,839
i guess it depends on to what extent

1585
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,599
their offices are actually closed but

1586
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,200
like literally taking those 67 people

1587
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,160
and going to their office saying look

1588
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,200
we've been trying to get a hold of this

1589
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,319
guy we've been trying to get this

1590
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,680
meeting we've been real persistent we've

1591
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
emailed you once every week and you know

1592
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,440
we keep getting delayed just

1593
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,000
it you know we're here we're we're here

1594
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,200
in person

1595
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
can we get a freaking meeting there's

1596
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,520
we're your constituents you are supposed

1597
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,200
to be representing us we just want a

1598
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,880
meeting let's sit oh and also don't be

1599
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,960
afraid to talk to staff too like a lot

1600
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,799
of times staff will be just for

1601
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,720
logistical reasons easier to get in

1602
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,599
touch with than the actual

1603
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,520
representative themselves

1604
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,640
if you're

1605
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,200
you'll so like don't be afraid to talk

1606
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,680
to like their legislative aid or

1607
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,880
whatever um

1608
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,400

a star council member to like carry your

1611
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,640
legislation you really should be with

1612

them in person to like get a good read

1613
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
on them yeah yeah that's a great point

1614

staff is incredibly powerful so we're

1615
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,720
talking about the aids the legislative

1616

1619
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,079
work but they also are making the

1620
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,559
