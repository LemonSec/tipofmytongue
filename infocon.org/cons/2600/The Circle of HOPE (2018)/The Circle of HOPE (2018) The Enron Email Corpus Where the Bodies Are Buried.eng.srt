1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,780
we're going to talk about the Enron

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,779
email corpus it's a great honor to be

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,820
here at hope and the title of talk is

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,349
where the bodies are buried there are

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,420
two types of bodies in this talk the

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,130
first one of course is an email body and

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,780
there's about a quarter million of those

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,820
and then there are actually two real

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,369
bodies and we're going to try and walk

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:26,039
through the detective story behind this

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:29,970
particular case so we have let me go

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,149
back one so what you see here on the

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,790
left is the mosaic of 5,000 attached

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,930
photos that were travel around today and

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,000
eat an Enron email corpus in this mosaic

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,640
as you can see is probably 40% white

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,450
meaning these are relevant corporate

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,000
documents and about the 20 to 30 percent

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,739
of the that you see or colorful are in

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,879
fact very personal photos that are

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,260
attached to folders of Enron employees

22
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,910
so we're going to do three primary tasks

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,099
here first we're going to fire all the

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,099
lawyers and this relates to a case that

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,490
Enron was prosecuted for it basically

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:12,360
Texas hacked California's electrical

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,089
grid and this led to a massive sort of

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,159
both political and power crisis in

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,590
California and we're going to take a

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,900
subset of the emails that were submitted

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,939
for the court case submit that through

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,250
machine learning modern machine learning

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,619
15 years later and see if we can

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,640
automate what was given to the to the

35
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,930
legal interns at the time so this is a

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,090
project called predictive coding and

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,079
it's all over many legal cases simply

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:45,090
because what was big in 2002 is is much

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,360
much bigger in 2018 the second as we're

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,299
going to try and find the fraudulent

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,939
activity before as it happens an email

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,219
so we're not true strictly going to do

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,079
pre-crime Minority Report but we're

44
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,079
going to try and anticipate could you

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,829
with modern tools actually see the

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,990
unwinding of this company and the third

47
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,910
project is we're going to ask why and

48
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,230
now I choose that partly because Enron

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,959
was famous for using this phrase and

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,510
ads they were considered one of the most

51
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,879
six six years running the most

52
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,429
innovative company in America and that

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,920
was their motto like apples thing

54
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,269
different was asked why now the in this

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
case asked why is a little more

56
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:32,560
confrontational because Enron's email is

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,980
the largest public email database corpus

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,099
and as many people realize email is a

59
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,349
two-way conversation so the fact that we

60
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,328
rake in 150 executives emails

61
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,730
we're actually raking in a lot of - in

62
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,920
firms there and we're gonna go through

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,420
some history of how that came to be

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,309
public so we'll say the average age and

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,379
this room maybe 30 so you were somewhere

66
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,480
in middle school I definitely was not in

67
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,950
middle school I was past that but so

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,890
we're gonna get a little time capsule

69
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,790
here and revisit what it was like in

70
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:15,250
2002 so as year 13 in the Simpsons only

71
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:16,540
17 more years to go and sorry and the

72
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,139
first thing you notice is the internet

73
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,388
came on a CD AOL and the second thing is

74
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,579
phones really were run by a Finnish

75
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:28,030
company Nokia and they actually were

76
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:30,609
mainly used for phones for taking calls

77
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,180
what you see over here on the left is a

78
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:36,519
word cloud of all the public sorry all

79
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,769
the personal email domains of all the

80
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,690
and run employees captured so this gives

81
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,349
you a view of sort of who was big than

82
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,280
aol.com now owned by Verizon yahoo.com

83
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,108
now invite Verizon hotmail office 365

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,819
and then we finally have earth link in

85
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,389
here somewhere which is a conglomerate

86
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,548
between wind streams and some people say

87
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,250
Church of Scientology but anyway the

88
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,099
point is this is who if i were sending a

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,250
marriage announcement at a burst a

90
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:10,179
birthday good wishing i may send it from

91
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,639
my Enron calm to any of these the number

92
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,790
one show is er over here to the other

93
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,820
side you have an employee who in 1999

94
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,500
says my job is so crazy it's exactly

95
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,960
like you're watching your without all

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,479
the blood now the interesting thing

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,729
about this is er exists today in the

98
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,000
form not in terms of TV show but in

99
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:33,250
terms of Enron oil and gas resources is

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,919
really the biggest remaining arm of

101
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,960
Enron after it declared bankruptcy turns

102
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,590
out that's the world's largest natural

103
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,520
gas frackie now so it are still exist

104
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,080
long long after the TV show because we

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,900
can talk about machine versus computer

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,840
about a mile from here at equitable

107
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,950
center in 1997 you had IBM deep blue

108
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,599
take on Garry Kasparov and even though

109
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,340
deep blue was not machine learning it

110
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:03,280
was really brute force chest

111
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,429
it really was sort of a remarkable event

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,070
in terms of a tournament event that

113
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,729
computer one human zero we're gonna run

114
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,500
up that tally on the computer side the

115
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,930
last thing that puts us in the time

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,300
capsule is we had the closest us

117
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,510
election looming and we have some Enron

118
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,599
commentary here that probably were not

119
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:29,349
the greatest advocate for our guy from

120
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:31,630
Texas a side note here though is 537

121
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:34,360
people in Florida will decide this

122
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,550
election turned out 10 percent of the

123
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,580
voting population in Florida held Enron

124
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,729
stock mainly through a pension fund so

125
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,770
these are teachers firemen etc and they

126
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:47,200
became the largest shareholder of Enron

127
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,580
as it was at ninety five dollars and

128
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,010
they had a strategy that we will buy

129
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,130
more at forty eight more and more at

130
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,900
twenty two and finally one was $1 all of

131
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,060
those Florida pensioners lost their

132
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,279
money turned out the third member of

133
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,070
that pension fund was the brother of the

134
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,889
guy who won so that's where we are we're

135
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:10,270
in our time capsule time period in 1998

136
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,979
to 2002 so at this time Enron was a big

137
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,680
deal I mean this was a six largest

138
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:17,380
company it would be equivalent today as

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,419
it eventually reaches its demise its

140
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,060
equivalent a day of losing Microsoft or

141
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:25,240
losing Facebook and it really happened

142
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,659
between August and December of 2001 so

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,599
9/11 comes and by December 2nd they're

144
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:32,210
bankrupt the odd thing is Fortune

145
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,650
magazine

146
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,359
really listen the most innovative

147
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,539
company for six years running

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,500
eventually in Ron 2.0 the founder gets

149
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:45,050
six counts of fraud but they had the

150
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,470
second four years running they had the

151
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,449
second most talented staff they had the

152
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,759
highest quality management they were a

153
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,520
top 25 place to work and they were the

154
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,560
world's largest energy trader so what

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,960
did they do and I think now we're sort

156
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,210
of getting in into where the corpus will

157
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,250
lie their business model was to

158
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,960
diversify and they had an asset light

159
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,270
model many of you may know the notion of

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,880
we'll buy anything sorry we'll sell

161
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,799
anything but we'll buy nothing so the

162
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,449
idea is that they were traders so they

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,080
traded natural gas they traded

164
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,759
electricity as it became more and more

165
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,258
just about paper transactions they

166
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,380
traded whether in the form of weather

167
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:29,090
derivatives or insurance they traded

168
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,039
carbon emissions they were a huge

169
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,539
advocate of climate agreements because

170
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,370
they thought this is gonna change

171
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:39,110
everything we do because suddenly we can

172
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:42,530
started just trading co2 they also had a

173
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,300
very big broadband division which was

174
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,520
one of the real downfalls because very

175
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,190
capital-intensive and honestly they

176
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,650
started running out of cash and the kind

177
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,389
of climax of that when you know you're

178
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,448
jumping the shark in this particular

179
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,729
business model is they roll out a huge

180
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,159
deal with videomaker block or a video

181
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,258
distributor blockbuster so Enron

182
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,729
blockbuster will become an issue later

183
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:09,500
on and so who were the cast of

184
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,000
characters I won't really get into them

185
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,270
there were 20 who were eventually

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,590
convicted or pled guilty this put one

187
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,659
particularly Andrew Fastow

188
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,758
was the chief financial officer and he

189
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:24,430
now lecturers to business schools hedge

190
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,500
funds on biz ethics things that go wrong

191
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,630
he does introduce himself truthfully as

192
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,140
I was chiefly poll loophole officer at

193
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,700
Enron classically they eventually got

194
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,468
him to plead guilty and testified

195
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,209
because they went after his wife who

196
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:43,219
also was an early person to be brought

197
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,349
into the court case I will say this

198
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:50,150
litigation continues to go on Islay

199
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:52,790
December 2015 Jeff Skilling who was CEO

200
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,319
and took a big part of the fall was

201
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,430
still petitioning a security Exchange

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,010
Commission when I get out of prison

203
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,079
which is actually six months from now I

204
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,040
still want to sit on public boards and

205
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,320
SEC finally said no so that's where we

206
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,329
are it's very easy at this point to sort

207
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,760
of dismiss Enron we don't do that sort

208
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,080
of stuff anymore and it's also easy to

209
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,140
villainize them and I just want to

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,140
present a counterpoint here Enron was an

211
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,390
early advocate of climate agreements the

212
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,689
Kyoto climate agreement they lobby like

213
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,480
like Mahan for mmm they also really led

214
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,520
the natural gas boom which is really are

215
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,890
in some many cases the best chance to

216
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,449
displace cold early you can make an

217
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,100
argument you would not have had Governor

218
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,010
Schwarzenegger in California you would

219
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,930
not have had Texas governor Bush mm-hm

220
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,880
and finally you would not had a Death

221
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,680
Star which is why I include it this way

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,390
and Death Star in this context will mean

223
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,719
a trading strategy to knock out

224
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,520
california's electrical grid so here we

225
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,980
are at the corpus two point two

226
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,280
terabytes seemed like a lot in nineteen

227
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,650
and 2001 now it's probably average

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,230
google drive so you've sent a taken an

229
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,949
entire corporation 20,000 employees and

230
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:07,280
you're it so in essence you have to you

231
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,100
have to go out and search your email for

232
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,069
stuff that might look suspicious when

233
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,570
they rolled up Enron in a digital sense

234
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,430
it was a hundred and fifty one senior

235
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,720
executives there was a obvious reason

236
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,189
they went after the executives and will

237
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,960
elaborate on on that various accounts of

238
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,300
the full number one point seven million

239
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,450
huge amount of spam a huge amount of

240
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,390
this is people forwarding dumb joke

241
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,010
threads so there's actually probably

242
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,449
five hundred thousand messages which

243
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,189
eventually get whittled down to about

244
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,920
two hundred twenty thousand messages if

245
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,860
you were to print it it's a quarter

246
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,510
million pages so don't print it it's

247
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,890
about twenty thousand dollars to print I

248
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,460
became interested in this number when

249
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,560
people talked about printing Wikipedia

250
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,110
and it would take you two point seven

251
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,420
years to read this so some sympathy for

252
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,770
the legal interns who

253
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:03,800
tried so around February of 2002 so now

254
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:07,160
we're like three months after they've

255
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,510
declared bankruptcy the FBI came in and

256
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,329
said freeze you know we're gonna

257
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,800
preserve all your electronic documents

258
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,370
don't destroy anything and these are

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,589
actually the boxes at Houston FBI

260
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:23,120
headquarters of our the field office and

261
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,830
the charge was led by Federal Energy

262
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,410
Regulatory Commission which is part of

263
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,570
the Department of Energy and they were

264
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,939
really responsible for regulating

265
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,750
both the grid and natural and natural

266
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,370
gas so let's try and build a bigger

267
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,690
machine a better machine

268
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,060
there's an interesting New Yorker

269
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,160
article in 2017 I'd really recommend but

270
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,229
it says Enron email corpus is where

271
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,079
everyone exercises the machine learning

272
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,600
everyone exercises so many PhD theses

273
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,340
built on this it's actually in texting

274
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,070
nobody's read as there's no one who has

275
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,510
read this is a book so we can try and be

276
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,610
the first one but I kind of doubt we'll

277
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,590
get there an interesting side note here

278
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,210
is there's an hour project in 2016

279
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,760
called The Good Life and you would sign

280
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:09,290
up and you would say I agree to receive

281
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,630
49 emails a day for the next 28 years so

282
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,640
basically you and their argument is

283
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,620
you're going to relive the demise the

284
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,939
slow night marriage to let demise of

285
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,650
this piece by piece I will say and you

286
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,500
know I think people have heard various

287
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,230
stories here but there are 4,000

288
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,680
research papers academic research papers

289
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,930
135 in just this year so broadly

290
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,800
speaking 10,000 academic authors

291
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,329
graduate students legal interns so what

292
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,130
can we possibly say knew about it and

293
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,510
that's really the point of this talk and

294
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,810
why I think it might be of interest to

295
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,000
hope so I won't belabor too much about

296
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,050
machine learning there's just fantastic

297
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,700
online resources for this I will talk in

298
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,530
cheatsheet sort of way on the far left

299
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,780
you see a decision tree and this is most

300
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,270
familiar to programmers it's basically

301
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,920
an if-then tree most you know video

302
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,660
games are built on this there's a

303
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,819
variant that will show up a few times

304
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,040
called random forest which is basically

305
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,250
a decision tree x

306
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,709
these subsets and all of those decision

307
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,889
trees will eventually vote and the idea

308
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:19,130
is to break the the fragility of a

309
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,019
decision tree in other words a sin trees

310
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,029
don't respond well to new data they

311
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:25,310
haven't seen before the middle part I'll

312
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,050
skip over and the far left will talk

313
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,569
about neural nets and this you just

314
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,579
can't escape at a machine learning

315
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,920
lordly since about 2012 when it just

316
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:36,170
started taking over image and audio and

317
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,569
text-to-speech it turned out it's a

318
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,360
terrible algorithm for this problem and

319
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,729
bullsh-- largely because there's just

320
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,740
not an internet size of data it's two

321
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:50,389
hundred twenty thousand emails and so it

322
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,279
tends to not perform well so here's the

323
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,870
problem with Enron it has all the

324
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,850
components you would expect so we will

325
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,540
build a data set which will have dates

326
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,550
and we'll have a chronology and you meet

327
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,980
encounter why email so messy not only

328
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,508
are we gonna do unstructured text but

329
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,360
the way it's distributed these days

330
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:11,750
distributed everywhere we're gonna draw

331
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,019
on the 2004 USC version which has been

332
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,329
cleaned again in 2016 but basically it's

333
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:20,480
organized as if you had the original

334
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:24,769
stack of 200 cedis which is really how

335
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,190
this thing was moved around and so it's

336
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:31,160
it's it's outlook and outlook binaries

337
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,250
dumped to folders labeled by people so

338
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,079
we're gonna break all that structure and

339
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,329
basically sort it by day so we can say

340
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,130
well this is what was happening on 9/11

341
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:43,189
in Enron or this is what was happening

342
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,260
when they were raided by the FBI the

343
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,779
interesting part is of course with email

344
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,790
is some of these people have we were

345
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:53,029
interested in tracking the people and so

346
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:57,019
some of these people have you know seven

347
00:14:53,029 --> 00:15:00,680
aliases and Enron a creepy thing of Ken

348
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:03,170
dot dot Lai at Enron so a lot of this

349
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,949
stuff because it becomes hard task to

350
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,899
make it pin to a person the way machine

351
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,699
learning usually works is I have a

352
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,370
favorite flavor and you give me a new

353
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,630
problem and I spin on my black box we're

354
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,150
gonna take a little bit different

355
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,430
approach we just throw the whole

356
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,350
world of training algorithms against

357
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,599
this against this it's actually more

358
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,520
like thousands but really we're gonna

359
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,410
talk about sixteen major families and

360
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,890
we're gonna try and present this is

361
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,079
accuracy on one axis and time of

362
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:37,100
execution it some are slow you don't

363
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,080
want to be slow and inaccurate finally a

364
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,560
topic that's very important in this area

365
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,330
is how do you tell someone my algorithm

366
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,869
works and this is called some

367
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,880
explainable III so we're gonna try where

368
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,430
we can to extract human explainable

369
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,260
rules how do you know you're emulating

370
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,380
what the lawyers were really thinking so

371
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,180
here we are task one we're going to fire

372
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,760
some lawyers

373
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,359
I put the Terminator here because there

374
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,210
is a debate about AI taking all our jobs

375
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,890
and it certainly gave him a job in the

376
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,540
sense that California and 2000

377
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,460
deregulated electrical grid and Enron

378
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,339
was in on the beginning of it and they

379
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,530
love to push electricity around you

380
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,870
can't you couldn't store it you didn't

381
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,459
have a Tesla battery so you got to keep

382
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,220
it moving and so you could move it

383
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:31,580
across borders to Utah sell it back to

384
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,980
California you can move it to Nevada

385
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,620
move it back and there were little pinch

386
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,960
points where Enron knew you would get a

387
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,030
congestion fee and so they would start

388
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,850
shooting against the congestion fee and

389
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:48,680
collect for basically issuing paper

390
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:58,070
orders so this is our task and if this

391
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:59,660
will play now that we're fully askance

392
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,670
see what's going on I don't know what

393
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,740
the market price is where they used to

394
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,950
deal with it they needed something and

395
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:15,030
you needed it now

396
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:17,640
it could take you an hour days the price

397
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,950
was hidden and it took an incredible

398
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,860
amount of work to dig it out Enron

399
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:26,580
online will change the markets for many

400
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:29,219
many commodities it is creating an open

401
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:33,389
transparent marketplace that replaces

402
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,120
the dark blind system that existed it is

403
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,490
real simple it turn on your computer and

404
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,229
it's right there if you want to do

405
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,230
business you push the button

406
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,480
that's our vision now we're trying to

407
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:50,309
change the world I love the ask why at

408
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,440
the end and I also love the fact that's

409
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,660
like a normal day in New York but anyway

410
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,820
the point the point of it is it's not

411
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,220
they have a kind of overshadowing like

412
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,990
the famous Apple 1984 like something

413
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,370
creepy is going on you should ask why

414
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:08,640
and that's Jeff Skilling so the court

415
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,399
case is cal texas is gonna really try

416
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
and jam up california's grid and they

417
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,510
have a lot of different strategies they

418
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,610
all took movies at the time that one

419
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,470
called get shorty they had one called

420
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,620
Death Star they everyone called Fat Boy

421
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:26,160
each one of these techniques is kind of

422
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,229
trading 101 you know buy high buy low

423
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,919
sell high whatever but they had

424
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,690
basically a manipulation of demand here

425
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,600
the interesting thing to not get too

426
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,880
arrogant is Enron founder Ken lice on

427
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,889
the phone to a guy in California he says

428
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,840
you guys can do whatever crazy things

429
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,470
you people in California do but we're

430
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,540
smarter than you so the first thing

431
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,150
we're gonna do is we're an intern we've

432
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,059
just been dumped 220,000 emails and

433
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,429
we're gonna start building decision

434
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,260
trees so if you imagine this like you're

435
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,350
searching your Google Drive and you're

436
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,750
looking for some particular documents

437
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,000
you said you start with single keywords

438
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,970
that fails that actually it was an

439
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,580
entire MIT master's thesis someone wrote

440
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,140
boolean search kind of fails if you look

441
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,990
for fraud in accounting you're not gonna

442
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,210
find it in here and then you naturally

443
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,910
will build up more complex searches so

444
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,419
that's kind of a decision tree so what

445
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,730
you see on the right is the three orange

446
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:30,120
things at the before orange but buckets

447
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,400
at the bottom or this is realm it's

448
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,979
relevant to the court case the gray ones

449
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,480
say no so we're gonna start at the top

450
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,690
and we're gonna say if it included

451
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,179
California if it included demand if it

452
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,610
included system and if it included bid

453
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,160
it's likely irrelevant to this court

454
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,649
case and then there's another branch

455
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,220
which says if it includes California gas

456
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:56,050
and Jeff it also is relevant now this is

457
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:00,600
a bootstrap technique so the idea is

458
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,280
given 220,000 emails I will hand score

459
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,980
851 so they use like early crowd

460
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,860
sourcing crowd for you can do this but

461
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,540
the basic idea is from 851 I'm going to

462
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,250
generalize to 10,000 I'm going to use

463
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:17,050
those 10,000 from my training set and

464
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:19,960
I'ma generalized to 220,000 so let's

465
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:24,040
make this explainable in fact in seven

466
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,290
lines of code we can capture 75% of what

467
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,899
the interns capture and actually

468
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,310
submitted to the court case so this is

469
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,010
really you could write this in any

470
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:40,480
language you like when california' speak

471
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:42,730
about California so if you talk about

472
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,640
bid or if you talk about gas we it's

473
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,800
worth submitting so these are these are

474
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,250
the ways you would build from a decision

475
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,580
tree

476
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,890
now clearly you're not gonna win any

477
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,439
data competitions with 75% right

478
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:01,390
it still is remarkably simple and I like

479
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,610
it so now the promised we're gonna throw

480
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,340
some human knowledge we're not gonna of

481
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,620
AI here we're not gonna do the whole 51

482
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,230
on this but what I showed you down here

483
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,159
at the bar and the corner left you're

484
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,120
looking at accuracy versus time this

485
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,340
this labeled card is a is the one tree

486
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,620
decision tree so it gets into eighty

487
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,050
seventy five percent range and it's very

488
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,959
fast if you go up here we also have some

489
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,690
neural nets and we finally we get we we

490
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,390
get up to random for us turns out you

491
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:37,540
know with kind of like your average data

492
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:40,750
science project you can get 95 percent

493
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,879
plus 99 percent of what the legal

494
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,190
interns did and this becomes more

495
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,010
relevant as you and I produced more data

496
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:51,220
if you wanted to sue some ISP or

497
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:53,530
something they might they might have

498
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,230
discovery on your drive and you would

499
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,300
actually find out no lawyer will take it

500
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,280
because so many interns have to go

501
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,860
through your stuff to determine what's

502
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,540
discovery so this is what a random

503
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,520
forest looks like a little bit more

504
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,530
complicated than our single decision

505
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,680
tree this is actually one of

506
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,720
50 of these so this is kind of the mind

507
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,360
map if you will of what the interns are

508
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,340
doing and it starts at state and then

509
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,520
you would branch to market and then with

510
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,870
more March to implement and finally you

511
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,930
get down here to all the surrounding

512
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,959
orange buckets are zeros in this case

513
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:32,560
meaning non-responsive the blue little

514
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,840
tabs are responsive so you you could

515
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,970
even program this it's very easy to dump

516
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,980
into a bunch of if-then statements and

517
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,270
then you can implement it and then you

518
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,280
can start running these like mad the

519
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,580
cool feature of random forests and this

520
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,830
will close out our first task is they

521
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,350
can tell you why they made the decision

522
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,310
or at least like our simple seven lines

523
00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:01,090
of code can do 75% of this job they will

524
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:03,669
tell you if to capture the data that the

525
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,120
interns implicitly captured if you have

526
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,860
price and transmission in California

527
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,070
those are at the interesting part to me

528
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,110
is also it's kind of more interesting

529
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,470
the percent right is what's not

530
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,570
important here and you go down here

531
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,700
power is number two the one I like is

532
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,770
the third lowest is please so you're

533
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,290
pretty sure if somebody asks please in

534
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:30,670
an email they were really not going to

535
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:32,680
be part of the responsive court cases so

536
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,660
now we're going to get to the pre-crime

537
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,490
part now I'm not a big fan of pre-crime

538
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,560
I think it's interesting thing in terms

539
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,540
of machine learning but you have to

540
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,570
admit very honestly we are way

541
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,610
post-crime I mean this is a cold case if

542
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,350
there ever was a cold case they rolled

543
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,750
up all the executives so if you know

544
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,879
anything about the executives you're not

545
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,310
predicting anything but there are some

546
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,920
interesting tools that I think committee

547
00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:02,770
exposed by this notion of a machine

548
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:04,690
Precog so let's play another ad which is

549
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:08,080
a little more aggressive and I think the

550
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:12,630
point I want to make with this is they

551
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,629
say ask why is a confrontational why

552
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:22,620
but it is a quick you shall watch an

553
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,620
abrupt word why it is the chosen word

554
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:36,720
[Music]

555
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,730
so what have we learned in 15 years to

556
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,380
ask why you know really because of

557
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,060
Twitter there's so much sentiment

558
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,940
analysis because of Facebook there's so

559
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,770
much social network analysis the first

560
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,570
thing you can do is which very few

561
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,310
people have done everyone does social

562
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,550
network they love to say this is the

563
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,710
influencer and Enron but very few people

564
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,139
have really just say I'm gonna submit

565
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,120
their email to some sentiment analysis

566
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll show you later we'll do it with IBM

567
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,760
but you get back three interesting

568
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,300
buckets the first off so this is sort of

569
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,760
the email and how who's similar who

570
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,770
writes like they do turned that Ken Lay

571
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,960
is in this whole realm all by himself

572
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,210
he's the boss or at least the founder

573
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,950
then we have a lot of middle grip called

574
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,510
bean counters and this is really the

575
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:31,590
first group I went through because this

576
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:34,230
is a lot of the the bad guys in in this

577
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,810
particular problem and it's very boring

578
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,440
reading honestly and then the far right

579
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,179
the far left or your right are the day

580
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,370
traders and these are the real colorful

581
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,290
guys I mean they will say anything to

582
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:51,389
anybody with no fear of ever getting

583
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:54,480
fired so turns out IBM went on to win

584
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,790
jeopardy against a human and they have a

585
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,500
very interesting sentiment that they

586
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,260
mark it through IBM Watson called

587
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,540
personality inside so I was let's poke

588
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,260
poke some emails through it so you just

589
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:10,320
upload 10 about 2500 words so that's

590
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,240
about 10 pages and it comes back pretty

591
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,120
good I mean there's probably a horoscope

592
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,070
effect here it says it so you put paste

593
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,750
it on that person but can't lay it with

594
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,700
the son of a Baptist preacher he was

595
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,550
very very fond of his values and

596
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,380
integrity in some sense the least well

597
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,870
equipped to defend the company because

598
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,880
he just never had thought of himself in

599
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:34,260
the terms that he was described the

600
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,760
middle guy is CFO he's actually in some

601
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,550
sense because he pled guilty he's been

602
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,080
the most sort of apologetic but he does

603
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:45,720
say I was extremely guilt greedy but his

604
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,790
his basic IBM at the top what you're

605
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,590
reading here is what IBM says his

606
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,750
personality based on his writing and

607
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,100
here he says you know we should all

608
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,350
take care of our own business leave me

609
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,330
alone and the interesting one is Jeff

610
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,270
Skilling on the right he was the CEO for

611
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,919
a while he was the one who really went

612
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:05,070
down with the ship but refused to

613
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,720
believe he was sinking and his riding

614
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,540
say he was written it really for the

615
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,730
prestige and that kind of works when you

616
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,350
go through the emails so here's our

617
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,570
pre-crime formula we're gonna run

618
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,399
through decision tree again this time

619
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,669
it's gonna be a this is a really hard

620
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,750
problem and we actually capture it by

621
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:26,760
blending with financial data so this is

622
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:31,200
where I'm saying we're way post-crime in

623
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,820
no way using anything magic here but if

624
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,670
you were an executive you were likely

625
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,490
part of this roll up if you were bonus

626
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:40,080
you really benefit it and probably had a

627
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,450
pretty good foot in the door

628
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,820
oddly enough if you did not send many

629
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,800
emails you were in the c-suite in other

630
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,870
words you are already talking you just

631
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,169
didn't send much email you're likely

632
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,659
gonna get rolled up the third part of

633
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:58,020
this particular formula for decision

634
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,050
trees is if you have some anger right in

635
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,080
the email by sentiment analysis you're

636
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,389
likely a person of interest and so

637
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:11,580
that's anyone can code that you can run

638
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:13,470
all 225,000 and see who got away now

639
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,810
we're gonna look at the reasons that it

640
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,600
finds and the most interesting to me are

641
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,440
again some of the least predictive but

642
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,020
as I say a pretty good guess executive

643
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,240
got a bonus didn't send a lot of emails

644
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,460
in this case this is a random for us

645
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,430
fear there was some fear some fear and

646
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,130
anger in those emails the least percent

647
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:38,010
predictive is I'm deceiving and you can

648
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,750
take it as part of maybe they were smart

649
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,129
enough not the smartest guys and

650
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,340
remember they were smart enough to not

651
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,590
write it down and really Enron collapse

652
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,230
because everything they had built was

653
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,050
hinged on the stock value in one

654
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,080
sentiment left the stock value the

655
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,730
company can collapse but in this case

656
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,050
stock value is least predictive of

657
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,820
whether you were rolled up in other

658
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,820
words if you talked about stock you

659
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,610
probably didn't have it so this is the

660
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:09,120
whole sum total of AI that you can

661
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,159
Builders libraries this is 51 that

662
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,770
actually will converge on this problem

663
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,520
and again you don't want to be down here

664
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:19,200
in the low in your lower right of taking

665
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,000
a long time and being inaccurate they're

666
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,320
only three you want to be up here in the

667
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,570
upper this side and our decision tree

668
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,090
again it's very fast simple decision

669
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:33,659
tree are four rules are very fast and

670
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,928
they're down here in the corner and up

671
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,130
at the top you see random forest I'm not

672
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:40,470
advocating for random forest it just

673
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,210
happens to work in this case and all the

674
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,390
way out to the right you see Auto

675
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:47,850
encoded deep neural net so it's down

676
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:50,549
here and the not accurate takes a long

677
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,639
time no thank you google on this

678
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:56,700
particular problem so that's our second

679
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,900
task we can kind of tease out executive

680
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,090
did some bad things

681
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,059
our third task and this is what really

682
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:07,199
gnawed at me in going through this task

683
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:09,540
is ninety-nine point eight three percent

684
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,940
of the company it was a job I mean they

685
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,270
had kids they had to do all kind stuff

686
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,450
and they're really taken into this when

687
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:21,440
somebody decides it's a good idea to

688
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:25,799
post it all on the Internet

689
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,980
so this is the actual a court order that

690
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,010
says we will release this into the wild

691
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,220
it's in the public interest to make it a

692
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,750
big research project so now we're you

693
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,630
know about a year and a couple months

694
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,370
after bankruptcy so one of curious

695
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,380
things is you could be rolled up in this

696
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:48,959
after you were laid off which kind of

697
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:50,790
makes it super bitter but anyway the

698
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,650
statement they made was there's a public

699
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,240
right to disclosure which out where is

700
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,100
individual right to privacy and I don't

701
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,970
really want to simplify this too much

702
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:03,299
because there is a right to explore and

703
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:05,760
the fact that it sits on 200 CDs in some

704
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:08,490
archive doesn't really help anybody to

705
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,040
learn from the mistake but there is a

706
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,590
mistake in terms of just imagining it as

707
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,780
a one-way conversation maybe it's easier

708
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,389
if you know they did something terrible

709
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,759
it's not if they just

710
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:21,439
Road to someone terrible and you know I

711
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,209
have hit down here or a short regular

712
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,690
expression that could clarify some of

713
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,869
this

714
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,959
so Enron did everything this is where it

715
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:32,478
gets just so mind-blowing because and

716
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:34,489
because it's a legal case there kind of

717
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:36,200
was a precedent you're the defendant if

718
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,129
you think there's something offensive in

719
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,190
here you tell us

720
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:43,039
what to take out but this time Enron had

721
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,609
20% of their staff they had one IT guy

722
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,349
it's like a huge circular monstrosity in

723
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:51,829
Houston and it's empty

724
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:54,589
and one IT guy so they give it as an

725
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:56,719
internally crowdsource project here's a

726
00:31:54,589 --> 00:32:00,139
hundred people at Enron you're the last

727
00:31:56,719 --> 00:32:03,079
stragglers read your boss's email and

728
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,949
tell us what's private right and what

729
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:07,279
can go wrong

730
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:10,070
so when you know you're a sinking ship

731
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,649
because they incentivize people who've

732
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:15,349
read the most emails so I can click

733
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:17,958
click click click Wow ok I'm done click

734
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:20,479
and they give you t-shirts if you were

735
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:23,419
the top or they gave you baseball

736
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:27,549
tickets to clean out your boss's email

737
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:30,619
box and the grand prize was a day off so

738
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:35,389
that's to me that's to me the real jump

739
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:38,449
in the shark movement so Duke law did a

740
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:40,908
study in 2016 and they said there's

741
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:43,759
10,000 pieces of personally identifying

742
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:47,299
information in here that circulates when

743
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:50,690
it's distributed and there's kind of

744
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:52,369
this horrible ranked list of things that

745
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,339
can go wrong so security numbers credit

746
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:56,570
card numbers passwords these days phone

747
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,879
numbers birth dates

748
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:02,299
I mean how common is it in a corporation

749
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:04,759
to come out and say happy birthday well

750
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:09,469
it turns out that becomes a potentially

751
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:13,129
PII so I did the same thing I found

752
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:15,709
50,000 in here and there's all kinds of

753
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:18,320
tricks to do it but basically this is

754
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:19,729
regular expressions this is graph this

755
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,579
is all the things that you would

756
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:24,259
normally throw at this kind of problem

757
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:26,059
and these are kind of the tallies there

758
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,190
are at least four Social Security

759
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,020
numbers still circulating if you're

760
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,350
willing to break all the attachments

761
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:35,690
to tax and I'll show some of the tools

762
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:39,409
you can get thirty one more unique so

763
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:42,020
basically out of 151 executive emails at

764
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,880
least a fifth of them are their life is

765
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,300
preached it's kind of just a horrible

766
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,180
outcome and it just doesn't it doesn't

767
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,310
make sense why didn't they actually told

768
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,350
the people who are searching it just

769
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,669
like you're on Google type in social

770
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,879
security number and if somebody wrote

771
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,830
that social security number in English

772
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,640
will strip it they didn't try three

773
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:07,250
digits two digits four digits so there

774
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,220
are common reasons for such spillage and

775
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,239
2002 if you join the Enron Cycling Club

776
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,089
you had to give your social security

777
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,029
number and you had to email it it's kind

778
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,700
of bizarre if you were terminated you

779
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,730
had to give your email your your social

780
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:25,609
security number here's a twofer you know

781
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:28,130
this is a hip hip uh violation this

782
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,210
person is taking these prescriptions and

783
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,220
it's you kind of have a social security

784
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:36,610
number and it's all got to go on in

785
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:40,730
Ron's logo here here's the the seven

786
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:42,919
offset crimes you can commit don't send

787
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,490
your resume from an N rot to another

788
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,168
company from an Enron address don't send

789
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:50,750
your social security number don't send

790
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,908
your date of birth because I'm applying

791
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,010
for another job I'd have to get my

792
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,510
transcript which requires a credit card

793
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:01,790
and I'm gonna send to my AOL account to

794
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,850
the the real thing about the seven

795
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:09,800
crimes here is he's applying to be an

796
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:11,509
intelligence analyst from Enron so there

797
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,520
all kinds of credit cards in here that

798
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,490
are not worth going into except I like

799
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,120
the sort of human color of I'm in a real

800
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:23,479
hurry here and the other one is I don't

801
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,310
take me for a fool I'm not getting in

802
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,130
your vacation plans here's my credit

803
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:31,279
card and here's the actual balance for

804
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,140
your nice cabin there are password

805
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,590
tricks in here there's lots of sports

806
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,859
fantasy leagues they have password

807
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,890
resets Neiman Marcus

808
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,680
of online shopping in an office at this

809
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:47,950
time a get request on a URL will deliver

810
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,259
back you know the both password and

811
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,540
username in the URL people who knew

812
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,820
better like developers were trading

813
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,910
source code and this is an are function

814
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,010
that gives you their Oracle database

815
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,970
password I pretty much assume it's not

816
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:05,650
user password because nobody does that

817
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,390
but anyway the one thing that as I

818
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,040
pointed out in test two the one thing

819
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,490
that's so telling in this is if you've

820
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,620
got a bonus so there is an a an excel

821
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,589
that has everyone's bonus in it and

822
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,330
somebody at Enron thought oh I mean this

823
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,940
could be terrible we don't want everyone

824
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:25,180
to know the bonuses so let's give it a

825
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,980
password so you open this excel and it

826
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,350
says what's your password you can type

827
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,290
anything in here and it says no that's

828
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,140
not right you just want read-only and

829
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:38,740
then it's filled and spills out

830
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:41,170
everyone's guts so to me curiously

831
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,770
enough you can rewrite history here this

832
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,510
is the press release when video

833
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:50,320
blockbuster wanted to use Enron's

834
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:53,080
broadband trading they wrote a press

835
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,630
release and they the first thing and Ron

836
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,970
did and you could you turn on view

837
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,430
history on this word document and they

838
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,649
said wait a minute and Ron's not second

839
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:05,020
its Enron and blockbuster not

840
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,590
blockbuster and Enron and the second one

841
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,270
is which I really like is Enron says the

842
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,610
original one was going to we're going to

843
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:18,300
give reliable secure video streaming and

844
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:21,190
Enron says woohoo we're not reliable so

845
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,710
that's everything we could you know kind

846
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,780
of tease out here there's so much we'll

847
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:30,160
never know and in some sense there was

848
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:32,740
shredding going all along Enron here's a

849
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,049
lawyer saying it was a subject darkstar

850
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,540
in which he says we're in litigation

851
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,810
with American coal therefore darkstar

852
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,820
and any claim that we've misused or

853
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,640
abused please send all the information

854
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,230
to me and I'll take care of it but

855
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,839
really it was the thing that took it

856
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,680
down was the auditors themselves started

857
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,480
shredding

858
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:56,049
but the way they started shredding was

859
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:00,100
so interesting the guy in charge says in

860
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:03,160
court I instructed all my people to

861
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:07,060
follow the document retention policy and

862
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,879
this was code for if it's older than six

863
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,759
months shredded and so that was sort of

864
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,800
the the dog whistle that went out to

865
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,650
everyone and they shredded everything so

866
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,250
a talk couldn't be complete without a

867
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:25,090
short demo so this is we're going to

868
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:27,970
defraud some Enron documents in so up

869
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:30,730
you see upper left is a Christmas party

870
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,730
and at one point Enron had a Christmas

871
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:37,360
party in actually Houston Astros

872
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:39,910
baseball stadium it was a big deal and

873
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,350
in a hundred seventy lines of code we're

874
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,779
gonna unshredded

875
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,520
and so because this is a strip cut it's

876
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,770
actually not that hard a problem and

877
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,090
that's why you can do it 170 lines but

878
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,500
basically we're going to compare pixel

879
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:55,930
values on the edge and it turns out that

880
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:02,680
will reassemble Jeff Skilling on Santa's

881
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:08,140
lap if I can so I think this rule so

882
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:11,589
this is it it just ran okay so you're

883
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,420
welcome so this is actually a

884
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:17,140
fascinating problem if you ever saw the

885
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:19,120
movie Argo the CIA is trapped in Iranian

886
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,040
embassy they got to get out see I start

887
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,359
shredding all the documents and in the

888
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,810
movie I don't know if this is true but

889
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,790
they got a bunch of Iran got a lot of

890
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,250
Persian carpet Weaver's who knew how to

891
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:33,340
patch things together and they

892
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:35,140
unshredded it Instagram had an

893
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,690
engineering challenge in 2012 and I

894
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,970
think you know shredders now have very

895
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:43,450
tight specs so strip-cut would never cut

896
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,890
it so there's a human component to this

897
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,319
I don't really want to be flippant about

898
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,839
it and it kind of draws two there are

899
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,390
three rules of apology you know I did

900
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,100
something wrong to you I really feel bad

901
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,410
about doing something wrong to you and

902
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,420
how can I make it better and we never

903
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,339
really got that here is a pregnant woman

904
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:05,319
on the day she's fired and there's

905
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:08,259
and lie being taken off the core but in

906
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:10,390
2010 they asked Jeff Skilling in prison

907
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:12,369
and they said what would you do

908
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,609
differently and he said three things no

909
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:17,859
question one I would have pled to fifth

910
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:19,509
actually Ken Lay did plead the fifth to

911
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:22,210
I would have hired a media person

912
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:25,150
immediately to tell our story and third

913
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,410
I would never have been sarcastic I mean

914
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,700
really you're hearty

915
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,739
you've already been there and the

916
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,609
sarcasm at one point was he said they're

917
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:33,549
on to us

918
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:37,029
which you know probably not a great way

919
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:38,729
and he says well it's sarcastic so Enron

920
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:42,369
was not blind to what they were doing

921
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:45,759
this is three days after this is August

922
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:48,729
2001 so three days after skilling

923
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:51,009
resigns his chief of staff writes to him

924
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:52,899
and says these are our ills we used

925
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:54,489
aggressive accounting we did black box

926
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,710
reporting meaning we didn't really have

927
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:59,619
a business or couldn't explain it

928
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,210
we overhyped the stock but the part

929
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:03,880
that's really bad is we had a mercenary

930
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,529
culture and then the part that you just

931
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,210
can't send that to the boss without

932
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:12,729
saying but I love being here so there

933
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:16,960
was a point at which it gets surreal and

934
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:19,269
this is that three days after they take

935
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,960
over and so he's going to go this is the

936
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:25,410
first employee meeting after the CEO is

937
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,160
resigned and everybody kind of knows

938
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,160
something's up good morning

939
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:53,850
[Applause]

940
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:59,430
I like this guy over here like why are

941
00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:00,900
we standing up Why ask why I will say

942
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,049
over here in the corner you see who I

943
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,030
didn't expect that okay I didn't either

944
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:09,030
so over here in left corner you see two

945
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,560
familiar characters that's Mueller and

946
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:15,930
colony who actually were the people who

947
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,900
prosecuted FBI Jeff Skilling so that

948
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:21,149
same sort of may occult but goes back

949
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,360
between Ken Lay and the chief of staff

950
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,670
says it really is that we have people on

951
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,390
staff who were rewarded to have little

952
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:35,070
or no respect for anyone and but I still

953
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:37,350
hope I love this place so the comedy is

954
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:41,460
there are dedicated employees spill

955
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,810
their guts here's one who this is about

956
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,660
a month before they declare bankruptcy

957
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,730
says there's still hope let's the

958
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,920
employees do a fundraiser okay this is a

959
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,560
seventy four billion dollar company at

960
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,930
one point like took at the bake sale the

961
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,690
good part is down here at the bottom can

962
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:00,620
laces I agree but we've decided to merge

963
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:03,090
with diner G for a variety of reasons

964
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,730
the other one which really is

965
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:07,410
heartbreaking is dedicated employee this

966
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,450
is three days before they'll declare

967
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,819
bankruptcy he says I've been an employee

968
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,669
for 21 years you have my vote of

969
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,650
confidence over here he says when Donald

970
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,330
Trump had was bankrupt he got the

971
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,270
brightest minds together and he rebuilt

972
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:25,140
himself we can do it too and then

973
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:27,270
finally he he comes back this dedicated

974
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,759
employee and says and I've given you my

975
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,910
last ten thousand dollars just to show

976
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,820
in my 401 K so that really became one

977
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:39,080
dollar so in conclusion we have the

978
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:42,480
largest public domain email repository

979
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:46,259
we found fifty thousand PII elements

980
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,510
which really should be redacted we've

981
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,200
automated some of the legal interns this

982
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:55,590
is by no means novel it is a big topic

983
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,759
and predictive coding is a big deal and

984
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,120
we found sort of the persons of interest

985
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,770
I'm not

986
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,569
proud of the fact that it's Precog

987
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,100
because it's very post but the

988
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,470
interesting part is what what's the

989
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,509
reason behind it so there are some

990
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,609
actual real problems buried in here I

991
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:16,820
think you could build some modern deep

992
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:19,920
privacy filters there are real fraud

993
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:22,290
cases that fraud filters that run

994
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,090
through currently SEC filings that are

995
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,550
quite interesting and as I say

996
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,490
predictive coding so these are the this

997
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,350
is the tool belt turned out you don't

998
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:35,939
need a lot of Hadoop here it's not that

999
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:37,710
big pearl Python or Java if you really

1000
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,180
are interested in the attachments you

1001
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:43,680
want to be able to split all that to

1002
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,980
text so on that I will conclude thank

1003
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:53,808
you

1004
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:53,809
[Applause]
