1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
this is us and illegal updates clearly a

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,410
page-turner

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,980
but it's I've realized this year has

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,849
been an interesting year in watching one

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,060
half of my career path run headlong into

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,380
the other half of my career path is a

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,609
information security professional at

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,720
least that's what I you know put on my

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,310
tax forms and it's been it's been

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,830
interesting because I've watched people

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,169
freak out and usually people are

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,308
freaking out about other things but this

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,050
year has been the first year I've

14
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,968
watched people freak out about how the

15
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:44,190
law is going to affect their their jobs

16
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:45,780
their companies and a lot of my a lot of

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,640
my tasks have been telling people to

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,199
calm down and wait but standard

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,180
disclaimers coz what kind of lawyer

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,430
would I be if I didn't do a disclaimer I

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,510
am a lawyer I'm just not your lawyer

22
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,260
some of the laws I'm going to discuss

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,149
our new which means that just because I

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,810
can read them and have some guesses I

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,030
may be wrong are as I like to say until

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,710
I'm wearing black robes my opinion means

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:22,009
nothing and that's a scary scary thought

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,589
me as a judge I have been wrong before

29
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,900
there's an article back when I worked as

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,540
a tech writer in law school and I

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,740
remember saying my favorite stupid thing

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,759
to say was why on earth is Apple putting

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,490
television shows in the iTunes Store

34
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,149
who's going to pay money for for

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,860
television shows yeah and I think I've

36
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,460
met some comment like cocaine must be

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,369
cheap in Cupertino clearly I can be very

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,899
very wrong so accept that and when I'm

39
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,520
wrong I'll admit it and try to tell

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,540
everyone that I was wrong and how to fix

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,090
my screw up I'm not speaking for any of

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,250
my clients or my employer if I still

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,830
have any at the end of this talk so why

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,590
are there laws affecting security

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,220
privacy

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:21,800
our jobs if we're somehow in the

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:24,819
technology IT security industry a lot of

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,730
these are attempts to fix problems right

49
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,589
legislators react to we see a problem

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,768
our constituents have come and

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,769
complained to us how can we involve

52
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:42,799
ourselves use the power of the state to

53
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:44,989
make this problem not as bad right like

54
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,180
think of think of the the the great deal

55
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,780
of pearl clutching we've had about oh my

56
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,819
god

57
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,810
Facebook holds all this data and they do

58
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,060
things with it

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,790
right we've been smug about that but

60
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,390
explaining that to mom explaining that

61
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,849
to your friends and we have to not be

62
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,099
the smug oh you should have known like

63
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:07,129
it's it's something we have to remind

64
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,089
people that and I know it's trite but if

65
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:13,099
the if it's for free the product is you

66
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,700
we say that like it's like it's a mantra

67
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,500
but it's a reminder that you know

68
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,208
Facebook and Google and all that they

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,310
clearly churn through our data and

70
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,200
they're they're not providing all these

71
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,950
services because they think it might be

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,328
valuable

73
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,190
it is incredibly valuable and the

74
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,959
legislators and whatnot of response are

75
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,030
we're going to respond to this by saying

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,190
well instead of saying you know fool you

77
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,950
knew I was a scorpion

78
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:47,540
instead it's no we have the power to

79
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,700
regulate Google and Facebook we can do

80
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,810
things we might do things that are

81
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,780
ham-fisted and clumsy but the the law

82
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,060
can be used to do this and it's coming

83
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,459
from my place of let us fix this problem

84
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,959
as we have identified it the problem is

85
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,959
that sometimes they come from a

86
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,579
fundamental and I won't call it a

87
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,329
misunderstanding it's a different

88
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:14,720
understanding of how things work right

89
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:18,858
the privacy your right to to Google and

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,349
Facebook and Apple and Amazon not doing

91
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:24,539
odd things with your data and figuring

92
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:29,580
out who you are and selling that on and

93
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,860
bundling it versus you as a product

94
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,020
right you you think you have these

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,830
privacy rights but you also want Google

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,200
Docs you want to stay in touch with your

97
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,780
family in a nice easy manner via

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,950
Facebook you want to entertainment so

99
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,929
you go to YouTube

100
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,300
well they're collecting all that data

101
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:53,280
and and the working that out as a

102
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:56,220
society is how and it's manifested in

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,250
some of these laws the free flow of

104
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,630
information versus criminal facilitation

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,310
you know we all believe information

106
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,280
should be free but what happens when

107
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,180
that flow of information is a part of

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,359
something facilitating criminal acts we

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,620
react and instead of just shrugging your

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,140
shoulders and going well information

111
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,250
wants to be free well some legislator is

112
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,590
going to come up with there's a way to

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,600
fix this and it might be clumsy and hand

114
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,390
fisted and actually counterproductive

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,460
but the problem is is that the

116
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,950
legislator wants the legislators hate

117
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,409
saying oh you can't do anything about

118
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,360
that like then we can do something about

119
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,540
that and they want to be seen to be

120
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,190
doing things that concern you as

121
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,380
constituents you as citizens so first

122
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,120
one I want to talk to because this has

123
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:51,500
been more and more interesting I the

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,500
cesta FASTA Act this is an attempt to

125
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:59,910
regulate Internet Internet activities

126
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,870
that facilitate prostitution and sex

127
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:08,070
trafficking and I caught an earlier talk

128
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,960
where the presenter mentioned that there

129
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,260
really you know it's a it's a fuzzy line

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,150
well not under the law prostitution is a

131
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:21,030
different crime than then sex

132
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:23,669
trafficking but what we what Congress

133
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,020
did with this was for the longest time

134
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,340
section 230 of the Communications

135
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,219
Decency Act was a safe harbor that

136
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,640
allowed that if you are a provider of a

137
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,529
service you are not liable for the words

138
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,498
of people using your service

139
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:43,829
simple rule right the phone company is

140
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:46,649
not liable for a murder planned using

141
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:48,719
their technology if they don't know

142
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:54,209
about it if they don't do a thing about

143
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:56,099
it if if you know so we decided to say

144
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:59,279
like look to let the internet grow to

145
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:01,829
allow the the to allow it to the the the

146
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,299
to allow companies to use it in new and

147
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:06,529
interesting ways for us to communicate

148
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:10,049
with one another we we allowed that well

149
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:12,449
it can be a Wild West we can allow

150
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:14,219
horrible things to be communicated

151
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,129
across your lines and you don't really

152
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,429
have an affirmative requirement to go

153
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,189
out there and police your stuff and you

154
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:26,248
can do so if you feel that well it it

155
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,529
makes the service better you know the

156
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:30,689
Great Purge at reddit well we find that

157
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:32,699
some people are being assholes on the

158
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,239
internet and that drives other people

159
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,979
out well well we'll cut this group of

160
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:41,279
people out to prevent this people from

161
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,008
leaving okay but it wasn't required to

162
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,689
by law so ii 230 said you had immunity

163
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:50,419
for even probably you know for anything

164
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:52,919
criminal happening on your networks and

165
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,659
susta files to remove that immunity for

166
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,758
sex trafficking and facilitation of

167
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:02,279
prostitution that immunity was actually

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,699
fairly broad even if the contents paid

169
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,649
for by the provider there's an AOL case

170
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,819
where they hired a conservative

171
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:13,199
columnist to post stuff and they paid

172
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,609
and said you know we'd like you to talk

173
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,469
about things and put up content and and

174
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:22,289
he was accused of slandering someone and

175
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,808
they sued AOL saying he's not just a

176
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:28,649
user he's working for you he's an

177
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:30,979
employee and court said nope that's he's

178
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:34,529
clearly a content provider and AOL is a

179
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:36,838
interactive computer service section 230

180
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,568
protects you you can sue the individual

181
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,050
columnist for for this slander but you

182
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:45,719
can't sue AOL even the contents edited

183
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,849
they actually had evidence that AOL had

184
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,309
cut down and modified the document

185
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,090
before being posted and yet it was still

186
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,120
okay

187
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,310
if a AOL is immune and even if the

188
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,730
content is describing a criminal

189
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,989
activity the provider is is not liable

190
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:06,540
that's the old rule under under this

191
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:10,110
cesta FASTA comes in and says there's a

192
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:14,490
new rule if you own manage operate or

193
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:17,010
attempt a attempt to own management

194
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,350
operate an interactive computer service

195
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,529
with the intent to promote or facilitate

196
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:26,550
the prostitution of another and that's

197
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:32,870
kind of a wordy way to say if you use

198
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:36,000
the internet to operate some guys to to

199
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,339
some help facilitate prostitution you

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,450
are you are a sex worker and you

201
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:47,760
advertise you are procure you are pimp

202
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,490
that not only is the prostitute

203
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,830
themselves liable the interactive

204
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,440
computer service can be liable for the

205
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:59,580
crime of being used to transmit that

206
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,030
information there's an aggravated

207
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,560
violation which allows greater criminal

208
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,829
penalties but also a private right of

209
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,420
action for anyone injured by it for

210
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,800
promotes or facilitates the prostitution

211
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,110
of five or more persons and reckless

212
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,030
disregard that such conduct facilitated

213
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,400
sex trafficking now sex trafficking is

214
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:26,400
differ different than prostitution sex

215
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:33,030
trafficking is the the using force fraud

216
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:38,130
coercion or some kind of threat to make

217
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:41,370
someone operate in operate as a sex

218
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:44,060
worker especially if they are of

219
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,940
underage if they're below the age of 18

220
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,339
so knowingly assisting supporting or

221
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,500
facilitating sex trafficking is also a

222
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,360
law is also against the law it's no

223
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,610
longer protected by section 230 so what

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,010
does that do to ISPs what does that do

225
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,010
to content providers website providers

226
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,560
okay sex trafficking recruits entices

227
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,020
harbors transports provides obtains

228
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,719
advertisers maintains patronizes are

229
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,050
solicits a minor for a commercial sex

230
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,460
act so using an interactive computer

231
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,949
service or an interactive computer

232
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:26,240
service somehow facilitating these acts

233
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:29,330
is criminal in and of itself if you

234
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,660
knowingly assist support or facilitate

235
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:36,470
now assist supporter facility it is

236
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,170
awfully vague if you run an ad that's

237
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,630
clearly supporting or facilitating if

238
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,120
you're taking money if you transmit

239
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,120
money if you are a PayPal and you

240
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,870
transmit money for the payment of a sex

241
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,730
trafficked person you have broke you

242
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:57,410
have broken cesta FASTA so what are the

243
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,380
impacts this is going to have on us

244
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,150
it clearly criminalizes interactive

245
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,880
computer services that are dedicated to

246
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:11,630
sex workers such as eros Backpage

247
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:15,590
rentboy if you if you are in if you are

248
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,750
a professional sex worker and you're

249
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:22,310
using and i if there's an ICS dedicated

250
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,870
to you providing providing contact

251
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,819
information providing photographs

252
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,180
providing availability information

253
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,930
providing anything that prove anything

254
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,790
that furthers your trade that

255
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:39,380
interactive computer service is now

256
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:42,530
liable criminally criminally and-and-and

257
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,450
monetarily for those act for your use of

258
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,430
it

259
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,180
so clearly there's an intent to promote

260
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,560
for say a back page or an eros now

261
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,550
here's where it gets weird

262
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,250
what about sites that are dedicated to

263
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,209
sex workers but not to promote their

264
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:09,110
business such as harm reduction such as

265
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:10,940
advocacy such as their there are some

266
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,310
sites dedicated where sex workers can

267
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,820
talk to one another about how to do

268
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,609
their business more safely

269
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:23,320
how to discuss potential customers and

270
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,790
blacklist them if they can if the if the

271
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:31,630
if the customer or John is violent are

272
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:35,410
rips them off are has a disease how can

273
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:37,720
you communicate that and and sort of get

274
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,819
the worst of the trade out well

275
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,340
that is clearly can can fall under the

276
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,070
you know if we go back to promote or

277
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,030
facilitate is that facilitating and I

278
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:56,200
think it is so an advocacy website would

279
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:58,600
also be criminal and this translates

280
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,730
back to not just that the the operators

281
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,510
of the website but it can translate up

282
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:09,280
to the provider you are a hosting

283
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,290
company offering that so so advocacy

284
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,089
site would also possibly fall into a

285
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,860
facilitation be criminal in and of

286
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,960
itself I think for sites that aren't

287
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,260
dedicated to prostitute sex work but

288
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,450
instead just sex positive does that

289
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:29,500
require them to have a duty to monitor

290
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,750
all of a sudden does say fetlife because

291
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,650
I'm sure there's some people on that on

292
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,230
that site that are not doing it

293
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,819
Cheerilee Cheerilee for the for their

294
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,290
own amusement but instead to pay the

295
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,500
bills

296
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:47,260
what happens does does FetLife have to

297
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,170
monitor that what about I don't know

298
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,330
OkCupid do they have to parse all the

299
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,599
messages between participants looking

300
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,680
for words that may imply that this is

301
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,020
not this is something commercial and I

302
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,780
don't see any guidance on how far that

303
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,430
goes do you now start grepping do you

304
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,560
now start grepping messages for terms

305
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:13,540
like generous sugar-daddy

306
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,729
you know and this is the problem this

307
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,829
this now this this question comes back

308
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,630
to every provider and i was in these

309
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,880
just been in these discussions in these

310
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,950
fora where you had corporate counts

311
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,780
going i don't know what this does to us

312
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:31,140
so they took a very if you were

313
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,390
if you were an OkCupid or a fetlife you

314
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,750
took a very dramatic approach and said

315
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,060
either I'm not going to you know I'm

316
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,980
going to aggressively do stuff if I've

317
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,959
identified that you've ever been a sex

318
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,720
worker just kill dude knock them off the

319
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,540
site because the the the risk is so high

320
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,400
to you as that provider that all of a

321
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,050
sudden you are now liable for the speech

322
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,160
of others you're now liable for the

323
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:58,829
actions of others on your site so I

324
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,620
while I don't think it creates one

325
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,720
legally operationally I think it does I

326
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,950
think it makes you all of a sudden if

327
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,060
you're concerned about your business

328
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:13,410
because you're not your if your business

329
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:16,079
is 99.9 percent not sex workers that one

330
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,120
tenth of one percent definitely impacts

331
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,850
you all of a sudden it's now criminal

332
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,460
liability so you're going to

333
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,790
aggressively just like any question how

334
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,590
if I find that you once posted on the

335
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,319
sex workers site and now you're using

336
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,339
OkCupid years later maybe that's enough

337
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,870
to kick you off because from a

338
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:40,710
overabundance of caution maybe I'll make

339
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,140
you go away so I've heard of several

340
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,880
sites that have either curtailed their

341
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,210
operations or just shut down saying like

342
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,220
we don't know the liability and we're

343
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,230
too small not profitable enough to

344
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,260
figure this out or solve the problem and

345
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,630
thinking of it even sites that did try

346
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,880
to solve this problem before says to

347
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,780
FASTA say for example Craigslist

348
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,920
Craigslist for that 18 months hired

349
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:10,649
people to review ads on both personals

350
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,189
and the erotic Services section to

351
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:17,430
figure out what them is this a band act

352
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:20,790
are you advertising a sex line which is

353
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:24,839
legal are you advertising you know

354
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,520
webcaming still legal but if the sex

355
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,540
worker shows up at your place or you

356
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,980
show up at theirs okay you're gone and

357
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,659
think how expensive that is you've taken

358
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,920
something that was essentially upload ad

359
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,570
you know put some contact information

360
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,010
that's the last I hear from you is

361
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,470
Craigslist and I Billy

362
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,060
you simple right I can automate all that

363
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,640
all of a sudden now I have to have

364
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,320
actual human eyes on an ad to figure out

365
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,660
whether or not I could run that it

366
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,320
caught it increases the cost of

367
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,730
acquisition so high to to unreasonable

368
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,330
amount so you just cut it out you're

369
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,920
like I can't profitably put this ad up

370
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,990
instead I'll just you know put up more

371
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,520
ads from you know you know trying to get

372
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:10,020
rid of my charcoal grill five dollars so

373
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,230
many sites that just shut down or

374
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,750
curtailed their operations then what

375
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,120
about what I think of as mere agnostic

376
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,750
sites sites that have nothing to do with

377
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,840
sex except that it's one of many things

378
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,640
we discuss as human beings like Twitter

379
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,939
reddit or Linode you know it's an

380
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,920
example right does Twitter have to now

381
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,750
look through because there are sex

382
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,780
workers that use Twitter to advertise

383
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,340
does Twitter now have a duty to now look

384
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,040
through their look through their

385
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,290
transmissions and say I think you're a

386
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,190
sex worker I have to either shadow ban

387
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,170
you or kick you off the site for a site

388
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,680
such for a company such as Linode where

389
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,930
your second removed right you have you

390
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,810
give a great deal of power to individual

391
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,790
users to do other things on it do they

392
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,870
now have to go through and figure out

393
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:07,740
what you're doing with individual VMs

394
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:10,620
what about I don't know you know just a

395
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,380
basic web host do I have to now figure

396
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,530
out what you're selling and have some

397
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,740
kind of authority to to regulate what

398
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:24,830
you do on what used to be very very thin

399
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:28,110
margin sites and I think says - Fausta

400
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,120
does put a requirement it puts a risk

401
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:35,310
that someone uses your site to do this

402
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,379
thing it eventually it it makes you it's

403
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,260
the cost is so high that I think you

404
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,820
will see people either pre-filtering

405
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,620
or possibly stop hosting inside the

406
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,270
United States the move the data centers

407
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,969
maybe with the company outside of the

408
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,580
convent oh you

409
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:57,880
outside of the jurisdiction just to

410
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:58,928
avoid the liability so that's an

411
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,600
interesting that's an interesting

412
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,299
attempt to fix a problem using a very

413
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,500
very blunt tool and I'm not going to go

414
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:11,710
into in-depth into individual groups

415
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,390
that that are in the space attempting to

416
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,530
regulate it the old-fashioned way

417
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,360
law enforcement advocacy groups who have

418
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,750
said you know I'm thinking of law

419
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,789
enforcement people I know who work on

420
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,590
actual child sex trafficking who don't

421
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:29,080
like this because now it drives it all

422
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,860
underground it's now harder to find

423
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:37,389
those people when when you had fairly

424
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:40,689
open sites dedicated to the the sex

425
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,909
worker trade you could fairly quickly

426
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,250
grep through the images to find known

427
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,860
you could track people by the images

428
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,419
that went up because you know you want

429
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,010
to generate an ad you're going to use

430
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,539
existing pictures that looked pretty

431
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,179
good you're not going to do a new photo

432
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:59,799
shoot for every if you move someone

433
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:04,030
around are you you know you relocate so

434
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,889
you're it made it hard itself is

435
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,710
actually making it will make it harder

436
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,919
to enforce those laws but it puts the

437
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,990
onus now on providers so it's it's going

438
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,450
to dry up a different section of that

439
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:23,380
market which maybe wasn't a big problem

440
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:24,789
so that says - Fausta other thing that I

441
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,130
think is interesting I wanted to pick

442
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:30,730
this out the SEC Securities and Exchange

443
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,220
Commission has been fairly lacks on

444
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,890
cybersecurity for of all the large

445
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:41,130
regulatory agencies SEC has been

446
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:46,409
trailing you had offices control of

447
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:49,740
currency you had the FDIC you had the

448
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:52,240
NCUA which is the credit union regulator

449
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,049
and you know the Federal Reserve's all

450
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,399
fairly aggressive about cybersecurity

451
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,430
they got together and generated the

452
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:05,500
FFIEC examiner's handbook which was a

453
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:08,850
fairly lengthy set of regulations about

454
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,620
how to do IT and how to regulate IT risk

455
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,149
SEC was always behind on this because

456
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,149
they took it and they took a rather less

457
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,070
a fair approach they've been talking

458
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,500
about cybersecurity they were the first

459
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,409
one to mandate or at least put strong

460
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,430
recommendations and to follow the NIST

461
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:31,120
cybersecurity framework but recently

462
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,160
they changed they change the their

463
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,439
guidance and they regulators put out

464
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,120
guidance which is this is the law this

465
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,370
is the regulation but this is how we're

466
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,320
interpreting it and it's usually fairly

467
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,270
useful information if you have to live

468
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,980
with it if you have to if you're working

469
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,980
for someone in that into if you're

470
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,560
working in that industry are you are

471
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,900
advising someone in that industry and

472
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,419
one of the things they did was they

473
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,930
changed what disclosures you had to do

474
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:02,290
to investors you every quarter you have

475
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,240
to disclose risks to your company we

476
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,330
believe that we're going to lose money

477
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,270
because of X Y & Z we're going to make

478
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,490
this acquisition the risks are here and

479
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,050
all of a sudden now cyber security

480
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,730
breaches

481
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,990
now sub security breaches have been a

482
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,880
part of that have been part of the

483
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,250
guidance for a while if you suffer a

484
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,860
breach you have to and it has a material

485
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:29,040
effect on upon your bottom line you

486
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,979
would have to disclose it but now

487
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,550
they've added risks so an unrealized

488
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,110
breach you have low quality security you

489
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,330
haven't been breached yet to your

490
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,000
knowledge but you know it's a high

491
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,310
enough risk that would affect investors

492
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,140
decisions in buying your combined stock

493
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:55,990
in your company now has to get released

494
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:58,990
so a and Equifax are a target if you

495
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,960
knew that you had a serious gap in your

496
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:05,260
defense in your controls even if you

497
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,930
haven't been breached yet you have some

498
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,910
kind of duty if it affects decisions

499
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,700
that a potential investor would make

500
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,380
withholding that information exposes you

501
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,419
to liability

502
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,110
and I'm thinking many of us who work for

503
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:23,679
larger companies know of something that

504
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:26,529
keeps you up at night at large you know

505
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,440
that large unencrypted data base that is

506
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:32,559
on the public internet that holds a

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,090
large amount of customer data and if

508
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,620
that got breached that would be really

509
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,740
embarrassing but it hasn't been popped

510
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,649
yet well all of a sudden because that is

511
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,899
not a breach but at risk you may have a

512
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:45,789
duty to report it to investors and I

513
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,860
haven't seen where this has happened yet

514
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:50,679
but it's sort of that that sort of

515
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,830
Damocles hanging over boards of

516
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:59,019
directors if they know now they have a

517
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:01,059
duty to disclose this and it's this is a

518
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:03,039
broader requirement than say state

519
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,039
breached notifications are a breach

520
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,779
notifications under HIPAA because if you

521
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,720
look at like state breach notifications

522
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:13,389
most of them are for health care data or

523
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,450
if it can cause a financial impact so

524
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:18,428
your identity your identity plus say

525
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,230
your credit card information or your

526
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,389
banking information that has to get

527
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,210
released but not just public information

528
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:27,580
not just your name address and maybe

529
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,850
something embarrassing about you like

530
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:34,629
for example the the Ashley Madison

531
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:36,279
breach a couple of years ago if credit

532
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:38,469
card information wasn't released it's

533
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,320
not it won't trigger quite a few state

534
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:45,159
laws because you can't use that

535
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,200
information for financial for direct

536
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,629
financial access to your accounts it's

537
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,500
embarrassing it has an impact in your

538
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:55,689
life but it's not you know probably

539
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,549
larger than a credit card gets breeds

540
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,659
you're like wow that I just lost a

541
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:00,340
credit card I'll get to know when there

542
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,440
should be in three days and I have to go

543
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,959
through instead getting your entire

544
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,610
Ashley Madison chats you know that's

545
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,230
especially you know knowing that you've

546
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,789
probably been talking to a chatbot is

547
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:15,639
probably more embarrassing and more

548
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:17,110
expensive you know and and we have up

549
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:19,750
until now really haven't given a lot of

550
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,459
like financial value to that you know

551
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,529
think of the you know embarrassing

552
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,450
things you might have said elsewhere and

553
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:28,090
that coming up well

554
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,519
under most say breach laws that getting

555
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:35,559
dumped isn't you know it's merely

556
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:37,539
embarrassing you know for example like

557
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,799
breach notification for HIPAA it

558
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:44,889
requires PII and healthcare information

559
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,679
for to justify having to ident to tell

560
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:50,559
you as the data subject well we happen

561
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,380
to leak this but instead the SEC

562
00:26:50,559 --> 00:27:00,010
guidance is just a risk of a significant

563
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,690
breach if it impacts investors so next

564
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,720
one I want to go into and this is one of

565
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,730
those it's actually a movement back of

566
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,490
the capability of a regulator Federal

567
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:15,639
Trade Commission after a couple years

568
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:19,840
ago actually just mention it FCC

569
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:23,678
regulates interstate trade and they have

570
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,470
the ability to fine or penalize a

571
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,190
company if they are doing unfair trade

572
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:34,120
practices and unfair is a fairly broad

573
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:37,210
it's it's it might seem vague but

574
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:43,268
usually there's a there's seventy years

575
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:45,039
of precedent to describe that sometimes

576
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:47,380
you get you have such bad trade

577
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,960
practices or so you know so sleazy trade

578
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,610
practices that they are unfair and the

579
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,380
FTC can come find you

580
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,879
and in a case they can they can

581
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,470
regularly both deceptive and unfair

582
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:05,230
deceptive would be I lied to you about

583
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:08,559
something and you are heard unfair is

584
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,110
just this even with no even with no lie

585
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,750
is still so bad we're gonna have to hit

586
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,820
yeah where did this info

587
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,139
cybersecurity is a case called Windham

588
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,960
the hotel chain

589
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:22,629
Windham claimed to have effective

590
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,769
security for especially credit card data

591
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:29,889
and they didn't you know no controls

592
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:34,269
laughably bad security one flat network

593
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:35,799
for each hotel includes so PCI data you

594
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:37,299
know credit card data was transmitted

595
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:44,129
unencrypted on

596
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:48,399
network information about your stay and

597
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:50,619
they had been breached and FTC got

598
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,498
involved by saying well let's see you

599
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:55,809
claimed on your website that you know

600
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:58,720
the security the security of data held

601
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,428
by Windham was industry standard here's

602
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,629
how we use encryption here's how we do

603
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,450
this here's that we do this and they

604
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:07,178
didn't do any of it so they filed suit

605
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,669
against Windham claiming both unfair and

606
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:13,629
deceptive trade practices and they win

607
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:15,820
and the the opinion was broad enough

608
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:19,149
that it seemed to it allowed the FTC to

609
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:21,340
essentially regulate really really bad

610
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:24,039
security yeah laughably weak security

611
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,499
was an unfree unfair trade practice and

612
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,840
this was interesting because this is the

613
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,769
first time it allowed a a what I think

614
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,230
of as a general or unregulated industry

615
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:37,450
we we in the United States for cyber

616
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,929
secure for security and privacy tend to

617
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:44,169
do an industry by industry banking is

618
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:49,629
regulated by gramm-leach-bliley HIPPA

619
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:51,789
and hi-tech regulate are the laws that

620
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:54,820
establish some minimal data standards

621
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:56,980
for healthcare but the vast other

622
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,439
businesses out there don't have to meet

623
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,999
any requirements unless there's a state

624
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,859
requirement and this allowed that any

625
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:08,980
company in any space is this holding

626
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:12,039
customer data had some minimal standard

627
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,080
that they had to meet and after Wyndham

628
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,879
the FTC kind of goes and says well I

629
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,908
guess we're the cybersecurity regulator

630
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:20,619
for everybody else and they get in they

631
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:23,200
they start doing investigation work

632
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:26,168
they've hand out that you know they they

633
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,710
they file suits they hand out fines they

634
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:32,200
do their thing and they get a consent

635
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:37,269
decree against a company called lab MD

636
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,480
and they basically require lab MD to put

637
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:42,909
in a bunch of controls that seem to be

638
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,639
expelled sort of expected controls you

639
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:48,190
would excuse you you would think the

640
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:49,229
decent security and lab MD sues them

641
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,870
saying

642
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,720
you don't have the power to make us do

643
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,639
these things you have the power to

644
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,370
regulate cybersecurity you are allowed

645
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,290
to say you have weak cybersecurity

646
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:06,870
that's an unfair trade practice but you

647
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:08,340
cannot specify which controls so because

648
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,399
the Vega said like you can put in these

649
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,280
put in these like 15 controls use

650
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,160
encryption lis Spratt you know all the

651
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,700
stuff you would find and say like ISO

652
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,500
27001 and two are the sands top 20 you

653
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,530
know basic stuff nothing really nothing

654
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,410
really are difficult and lab MD Wynne

655
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,889
saying like look you it's an injunction

656
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,690
it's a it's an order to not do a thing

657
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,860
well in in order to not do a thing you

658
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:41,370
cannot make me do a thing and it's it's

659
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,129
it's the legal nitpicker II but it allow

660
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,830
it essentially says well they cannot

661
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,419
they cannot make a company follow a

662
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,120
specific set of rules they can say

663
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:54,990
you're you're you're acting so badly you

664
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,879
have to stop but they the attempt to go

665
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,130
and make a standard that you can follow

666
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,900
and as a security professional

667
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,150
especially someone in like the risk

668
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,809
space it would be great like oh those

669
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,540
are the rules

670
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:08,879
I can audit against that awesome you

671
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,129
know just bring in some auditors they go

672
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,870
through they ask you you know 35 stupid

673
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,660
questions about databases and you're

674
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,070
done great you know I mean how many

675
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,320
people have gone through an ISO audit

676
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,639
this year yeah I'm sorry but at least

677
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,918
though you can go and say look there's a

678
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,660
rule set of rules they might seem stupid

679
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,059
from time to time but at least at the

680
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,010
end of it you can say we made most of

681
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,700
them we're closed

682
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,140
some are lies you know are what I like

683
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,630
to think of as you know the tapestry

684
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,220
that you know a lot of a lot of the work

685
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:46,950
of these people is to map a bunch of a

686
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:49,020
tapestry of lies into Excel by filling

687
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:53,840
out vendor security assessments saying

688
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:57,210
sure we do these things sometimes never

689
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,679
you know are you gonna check no okay

690
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,920
sure

691
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,380
can make it out of here here's blue

692
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,810
encryption okay yeah whatever

693
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,430
no I I did that for a little while and I

694
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,260
remember there was one question on the

695
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:13,020
questionnaire we had to ask and it was

696
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,090
about money laundering is the OFAC

697
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,450
barred list and we were in health care

698
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:21,990
and like why is this here who on earth

699
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,100
is doing money laundering and I asked

700
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,200
corporate counsel and they're like

701
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,389
that's not that shouldn't be in there

702
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm like well I've been auditing people

703
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:33,090
for two and a half years and and some

704
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,130
companies like yeah sure we do that and

705
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,659
you know it was not difficult to do

706
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,460
there's a public website you can see

707
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,260
who's banned under money laundering it's

708
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,300
like okay sure it's like that's supposed

709
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,280
to be this different list of people

710
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,080
banned from Medicaid like it's in your

711
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,810
spreadsheet man you have an army of

712
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,110
auditors asking deliberately stupid

713
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:54,300
questions and like oh I'll change that

714
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,209
and of course how did they change that

715
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:02,460
they added the Medicare question they

716
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:04,470
didn't remove that's like okay but right

717
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,230
but the advantages we can work within

718
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,600
that framework you can you can test and

719
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:11,730
validate and go we've done we meet that

720
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,620
standard the FTC can't come after us but

721
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:18,929
instead it's like you can't have laugh

722
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:20,250
at laughably bad cybersecurity and I'm

723
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,870
sure we all you know like so what do you

724
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,600
tell war stories and you're watched you

725
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:25,859
know that's that's how you you know

726
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,469
interview the staff and at the end of it

727
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,159
you go oh you didn't laugh at all of

728
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:33,928
them so your security can't be that bad

729
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,890
there didn't one-up me with oh you

730
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:41,600
should see how we hold patient data it's

731
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:44,100
all secure on pastebin you know and

732
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,630
that's the you know so so it's nice to

733
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,960
be able to set a standard unfortunately

734
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:51,300
the WebMD case says the FTC can't

735
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,399
mandate a standard like okay fine

736
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,470
because I would love to see that just

737
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,149
from a a simplicity there's a set of

738
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:01,470
rules we can follow those rules we do

739
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:04,620
the thing we're done but no okay

740
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:07,009
gdpr who here has been under a rock and

741
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,230
hasn't heard about

742
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:12,680
it's great because I I have a few

743
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,599
clients who have extensive European

744
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,589
operations and a lot of my job was to

745
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,220
convince the European based IT people

746
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:26,308
that they weren't going to go to jail

747
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,169
because as much beat up as we had about

748
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:31,559
it in the United States I could only

749
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:35,760
imagine like every every ad in every IT

750
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:37,250
rag every radio spot was like gdpr is

751
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,609
coming and it's gonna eat your children

752
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:43,770
you know so GD scoped EU data subjects

753
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:47,279
people in that part of the part of the

754
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:50,339
world that's the scope their data when

755
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,510
to effect May 25th the Sun came up on

756
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,740
May 26th

757
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,630
you know there are people like they're

758
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,379
gonna show up and audit us on day one

759
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:00,140
like they're a bureaucracy you think

760
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,780
they're gonna be that fast

761
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,910
nothing happens that quickly of course

762
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,680
you know I can imagine from a regulator

763
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,950
standpoint it's nice to like you're

764
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,589
afraid of us good you'll at least do

765
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,839
some things but the panic right so you

766
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,910
know the Sun came up the next day and

767
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,049
there's a maze of twisty little privacy

768
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,359
policies all alike and that the best

769
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:26,009
vantage that the best use of the GDP are

770
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:28,078
I think was to find out all the places

771
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:31,260
that you signed up for an account go oh

772
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,010
I signed up for that two and a half

773
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:39,029
years ago I don't remember why what does

774
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,799
this come to even do oh you know it's

775
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:43,140
like finding out that you know the

776
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:45,059
number of HR based companies like you

777
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,980
had to pipe the resume through them it's

778
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:51,329
like that's all you did that's the data

779
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:53,849
you have in me huh but you you all have

780
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:55,740
this flurry and now everyone's kind of

781
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:58,650
waiting to see what happens because it's

782
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,770
easy to put up a privacy policy like I

783
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:05,130
said it's a tapestry of lies right we of

784
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,720
course we do all these things you know I

785
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,220
remember and you're doing it doing a

786
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,649
basic like let's see if you're ready for

787
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,240
GDP are how do you get your customer

788
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,400
data and like well there's a database

789
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,279
like uh-huh where did that data come

790
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,989
from

791
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:20,229
and the head their head of markings like

792
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:25,150
I have to know where it came from

793
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:27,158
uh-huh it's like if you're gonna say it

794
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,019
fell off a truck I'm gonna be really

795
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,909
impressed because you know like well we

796
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:37,839
just had it like right now you got a

797
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:40,479
okay learn opt-in you know hey dear Bob

798
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,369
we have a lot of data about you

799
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:45,009
please opt-in if you would like us to

800
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:46,209
continue marketing to you that's and

801
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,409
like that's how you're gonna have to get

802
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,719
yourselves out of that because now all

803
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:51,479
of a sudden you have to treat personal

804
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:54,279
identifying information kind of like

805
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:56,198
toxic chemicals you want to know where

806
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:57,789
they are you want to you want to make

807
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:02,709
sure that the children can't eat them

808
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:04,959
and and you want to to kind of be aware

809
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:09,249
of them because they're valuable in a

810
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:10,928
both a positive and a negative way you

811
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:12,428
know data subjects have rights and you

812
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:15,579
have to improve to figure out how to

813
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:17,709
implement those rights in your

814
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,229
infrastructure and some people found it

815
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:22,390
very easy some people found it very hard

816
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:26,709
some people are just gonna lie about it

817
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:30,519
and wait and that's probably gonna work

818
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:31,868
for a year or two because we all heard

819
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,538
this you know four percent of gross

820
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:36,880
revenue the work that more dangerous

821
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:40,209
thing is they can do a stop data

822
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,699
processing order you cannot process this

823
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:44,499
data you have to get rid of it and if

824
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:47,289
that's kind of core to your business

825
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:50,019
you're like but that's you know just

826
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:53,109
stop processing French data subject

827
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,999
information well that would annoy the

828
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:57,489
 out of Facebook but imagine if

829
00:38:54,999 --> 00:39:02,529
you're like a France only company you're

830
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:06,880
like what I have to stop doing that yeah

831
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:08,979
and all of a sudden so it's it's it's a

832
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,349
law it's a large set of these things you

833
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,729
all of a sudden have to now do and you

834
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,409
have to figure out how to implement it

835
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:17,408
and there's a lot of credo there's a lot

836
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:19,839
of I first see that gdpr will have a

837
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:22,959
couple effects one it will have AI it

838
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,259
will be like the new HIPAA in that all

839
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:26,808
sorts of bizarre things will be blamed

840
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:29,509
on

841
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:31,699
like the number of people who said to me

842
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:34,999
with a straight face an IT like HIPAA

843
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:38,719
requires us what was the one HIPAA

844
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:44,658
requires us to have keyboard covers like

845
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:46,369
the old dust covers I'm like what like

846
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:49,099
it's because peoples like you take them

847
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:51,439
off before you type unless like you're

848
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:53,119
in a really dusty area and then you get

849
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,649
those like weird plastic things like you

850
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,299
see it auto body shops or whatever like

851
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,769
where did you get this waltz

852
00:39:56,299 --> 00:40:00,019
it's HIPAA I'm like can you show me in

853
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:03,379
HIPAA like let's let's traipse through

854
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:05,749
here no it's not there people will be

855
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,279
blaming the same stuff on GDP are you

856
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:09,439
know I mean like think that this

857
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:23,709
happened I heard this happened like this

858
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:26,839
week with British Airways survey

859
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:29,089
social-networking score it's all my

860
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,459
social networking is me screaming had

861
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:36,099
some kind of providing service that just

862
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:36,098
wasn't working and oh go like you have

863
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:49,099
it braces straight freaky ways and all I

864
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:51,339
do is I'm afraid that that's going to be

865
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,339
held

866
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:04,640
so so if someone else is catching had

867
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,980
British air for like this flight was

868
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,310
delayed then it was cancelled okay that

869
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,710
happens and the responsive British

870
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:20,660
Airways social networking people was to

871
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:23,150
say flame which I think the appropriate

872
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,080
thing like you know that flight the

873
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,910
plane yes

874
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,660
get up with British Airways we only have

875
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,700
one and please be more specific about

876
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,069
the flight you were on except that they

877
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:37,129
has to let you know your name your

878
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:41,420
address the last four digits of what the

879
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:43,430
credibly you just dependent Tweety why

880
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,760
is it be like here's our customer

881
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:50,870
service line called it but someone has

882
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,010
to go no no but you're gonna blame all

883
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,290
sorts of weird shape as you

884
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,090
misinterpreted it and that's gonna take

885
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,590
a little time for it to work out but he

886
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,460
you know it would be fixed liked about

887
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,780
14 years was a random stupid know

888
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,130
something about head-butting it's like

889
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,120
I've never once actions work but it was

890
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,730
someone's thing like oh you can't

891
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,040
discuss this thing like it's to

892
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,500
co-workers discussing their health with

893
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,029
one another yeah but isn't involved

894
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,030
because I'm not at a health care company

895
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,400
that gives you know

896
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:29,500
he's treating the other anything even

897
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,600
more incompetent than I thought doesn't

898
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,190
get involved in like when I hit the

899
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:49,118
assessment and of course I know my

900
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:50,859
response was okay yes okay we still

901
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,580
don't know things like what's the usual

902
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:56,830
security under article 32 acceptable

903
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,980
implementation of rights how to actually

904
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:02,350
do that in a cost-effective manner how

905
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:06,010
we're going to enforce it because every

906
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:08,290
member state has its own regulator some

907
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,630
ways go after the worst actors like

908
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:12,250
Cambridge analytic uh some are going to

909
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:16,030
grab for a big game because it gives you

910
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,920
a better name the privacy shield

911
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,710
suspension is interesting if anyone

912
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,560
caught that the United States may be may

913
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:29,650
get decertified and we will instead have

914
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:32,290
to add data export to all contracts so

915
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,230
my word for that is wait and see what

916
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:37,779
happens do the things like the private

917
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,150
unity the pro group privacy policies try

918
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,840
to implement the rights and then wait

919
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:48,550
don't freak out I'm gonna skate the

920
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,710
clown bags so trends geofencing I see

921
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,840
where you're going to stow fight your

922
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,330
German information and a German data

923
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,150
center or au data center and it's not

924
00:43:55,330 --> 00:44:00,779
going to talk to you you esto you're

925
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,880
going to claim to do so

926
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,040
yeah we're compliant we're forward

927
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,780
complying with your own 27-game and

928
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,940
withdrawing for markets if you decide

929
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:16,920
that you don't get enough business out

930
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,360
of that regulatory space sell like Excel

931
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,450
you mind game to someone else they'll

932
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:24,440
take it up there's going to be a flurry

933
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:27,810
look right to be forgotten requests

934
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,070
there will be endless fights because the

935
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,680
amount of shops I've seen that have

936
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:34,170
headed GDP or language to some contracts

937
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,700
but not others so you day they hear the

938
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,510
four things you have to sign and they're

939
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,980
all different

940
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:44,840
good job dick in the future where we

941
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:48,330
have a GTR yes

942
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,200
Californians already passed one degrees

943
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:54,240
of GPR how they're done the influent ow

944
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,660
everyone's that the implemented is to be

945
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,669
interpreted but we may see something

946
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,359
equivalents there are none people bent

947
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:06,630
out of shape I think it may happen now

948
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:10,200
of course what may happen is that I'll

949
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:12,180
skip ahead you might have some states

950
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,040
implemented and then the feds may come

951
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,830
in and print it or kind of some federal

952
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:23,730
law that would be able to say more

953
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:26,029
palatable I think I've got time for a

954
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,030
few questions

955
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,509
they keep going back to the SEC question

956
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,540
for a moment okay

957
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,910
Pickwick two parts has that bin

958
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,590
legislating we saw a lot of oesc data

959
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,460
coming out that they can kind of fuzzy

960
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:47,440
so when you say that is moving to

961
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,510
general best practice or there's a need

962
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,020
to disclose if there's a potential

963
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:55,810
breach does that follow any specific

964
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,660
standard blight you know best do be

965
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:01,180
reasonable cause or as éponine it's

966
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,790
going to be indicative of risk it's it's

967
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,190
if if there's a risk of death affects

968
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,440
the financial I can financially stable

969
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:12,970
so I don't think there's gonna be any

970
00:46:08,440 --> 00:47:04,090
established goals you mentioned that

971
00:46:12,970 --> 00:47:05,890
there yeah no no I think it's just going

972
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:09,430
to be yeah we meet that because even

973
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:11,200
then CSF doesn't actually require that

974
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:15,160
you follow any of those you could make

975
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:18,879
up your own if you're a sadist okay I'm

976
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:24,640
at a time anymore time for questions or

977
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:32,100
not get me thank you

978
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:32,100
[Applause]
