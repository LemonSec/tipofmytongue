1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,229
thank you so this is aiming to be a

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,210
little bit interactive we're going to

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,580
start by introducing ourselves I'm

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,370
really excited at the the quality of

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,509
this panel we've got a bunch of really

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,310
deep experts in different parts of

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,010
Internet censorship and it's a field

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,659
that has a bunch of nuance and subtlety

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,640
that we don't necessarily think about

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,769
initially until we've sort of really

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,930
gotten into the weeds of what's going on

12
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,028
there and it is a field that's changing

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,830
a lot so we're gonna I think start by

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,020
introducing ourselves and maybe the

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,329
first question that will that will sort

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,030
of try and address is what's what's new

17
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,790
in the in the specific little subfields

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,579
of censorship that each of us work in

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,050
and then we'll serve dive into a few of

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,340
the questions that come in there and

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,038
then open it up to the audience

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,780
questions at the end I'm told there is

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,840
one microphone sort of in the center of

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,190
the room so if you if you have dying

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,469
questions or in the area of internet

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,239
censorship and what we mean by that will

27
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,340
probably become clear over the next half

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,589
hour perhaps feel free to stand in line

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,189
there and we'll take questions sort of

30
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,220
later in this hour so why don't we start

31
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,449
with Riya and then we'll move down so

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,400
can you introduce yourself and tell us

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,520
and Safie and I'm a new faculty member

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,759
at University of Michigan in my lab we

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,270
try to develop new techniques to measure

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,159
Network interference and deploy these

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,829
techniques and gather the data to

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,610
understand the behaviors of the

39
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:35,008
intermediaries which does the

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,079
interference and then based on our

41
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,530
understanding try to come up with the

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,789
ways to defend users from hostile

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:48,119
networks network interference or

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,119
censorship they are it's a very complex

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,250
problem there are many stakeholders and

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,409
there are many reasons that the

47
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,579
connection can be interfered for example

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,689
from the users to the server there that

49
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,908
they provide the service

50
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:08,190
there are ISPs of the users there is a

51
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:10,349
government's firewall let's say there is

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,380
a transit network and then there is ISP

53
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,920
of the server

54
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,180
and the server itself and each of these

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,149
intermediaries can have their own ways

56
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,150
of blocking or interfering with the data

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,150
and so in my group and actually my

58
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,400
research has been try to give a fair

59
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,800
attention to each of these parties

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,080
because one of the key challenges that

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,240
we have had over the past years is like

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,180
we have been focusing on the government

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,850
side of censorship like studying

64
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,180
specifically studying certain countries

65
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,549
like Iran like China countries that we

66
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,400
call suppressive regime let's say but

67
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,130
Internet censorship and discriminations

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,360
towards users is a very very broad

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,600
phenomena and and because of the crowds

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,310
interest the shift has been towards

71
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,500
these certain countries but I'm trying

72
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,530
to change the landscape and say that hey

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,740
we should be interested to know is there

74
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,960
a censorship or is there two different

75
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,970
treatments towards users happening in

76
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,070
countries let's say Western countries

77
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,320
like do we are we interested to know

78
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,500
what type of contents Australia is

79
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,900
blocking and so it's really hard to get

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,720
attention towards those when everybody

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,200
wants to these days here a bad Russia or

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,770
China or Iran or think so another and

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,570
another type of research that I have

84
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,910
been focusing on is a server-side

85
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:46,150
blocking there is a reason for certain

86
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,600
servers to offer their service to the

87
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,330
certain locations because for example if

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,670
you are having a limited bandwidth and

89
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,110
you want to have a certain number of

90
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,670
clients so you don't focus on a certain

91
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:05,110
clients that they bring revenue goes

92
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:10,390
towards your product so we have seen

93
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:13,000
more and more servers trying to block a

94
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,320
certain countries and unfortunately

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,089
these countries are often poor countries

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,099
so we have been studying that phenomenon

97
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,988
recently more and more we want to

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,150
understand

99
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,609
why a server discriminates towards the

100
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:33,900
location of the users and what type of

101
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:36,300
server does that what else oh another

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,250
type of work that I have been focusing

103
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,349
on is what to measure I mean that's for

104
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,910
any censorship a study we have an input

105
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:51,750
list and in this input list is currently

106
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,979
being maintained by most of the

107
00:04:51,750 --> 00:05:00,120
censorship of studies using citizen labs

108
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:04,949
censorship list and that is a crowd

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,449
source basically list of the domains

110
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,949
that there is block somewhere or

111
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,319
somebody thinks that is going to be

112
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,870
blocked and it's maintained by activists

113
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:19,349
and civil society but you can easily see

114
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,449
that that is already biased so because

115
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,069
there are certain activists in certain

116
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,210
countries more active than the others

117
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:29,280
and so there are efforts to be able to

118
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,229
keep that list up data try to reach out

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,780
to many people around the world and try

120
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:38,400
to get them to contribute to that list

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:40,609
but I think in my group we are trying to

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,560
come up with the techniques to keep the

123
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:46,800
human out of it is there a way that we

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,979
start from 5 billion domains and we can

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,870
run measurements globally and do some

126
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,020
machine learning techniques to be able

127
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,080
to find certain domains that each

128
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:02,659
country is sensitive about and basically

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:15,780
have this list I started from a very

130
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:18,479
unbiased or naive in input will get blue

131
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,809
get more questions Lex do you want to go

132
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,240
next

133
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,099
sure cool so my name is Lex I'm a

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,889
researcher at citizen lab which is based

135
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:28,620
at University of Toronto our research

136
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,060
has broadly focused on the intersection

137
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,339
between technology human rights and

138
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,620
global security my background is

139
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,430
actually in law not tech and I've sort

140
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,650
of been asked to provide a bit of

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,080
context on those sort of Western u.s.

142
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,380
Canadian context around censorship and

143
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,300
and freedom of expression right it's

144
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,919
twin so just to sort of set the table I

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,419
guess there are three things I want to

146
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,469
focus on the first is you know how to

147
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:57,539
hold companies accountable when they

148
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,400
engage in the international sale of

149
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:01,380
filtering and censorship technology

150
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,810
which is a big emerging problem that we

151
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,039
don't have fantastic answers to the

152
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,620
second is I want to highlight some of

153
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,479
the sort of messy and emerging problems

154
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,339
coming out of freedom of expression law

155
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,940
in the West particularly around

156
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:18,240
jurisdiction and then the third piece is

157
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,500
just to to reassert or to keep on the

158
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,940
table to continue to important some

159
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,169
encryption and on emiti tools even in

160
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,509
Western countries that are under the

161
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,029
impression that they don't limit speech

162
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,830
or engage in censorship

163
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,930
yeah so I mean on the first piece I

164
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,490
think it's it's essential to say that

165
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,699
Western countries and Western companies

166
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,659
are in the business of building and

167
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,360
selling the infrastructure of

168
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,800
surveillance and censorship

169
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,389
understanding that issue is a big piece

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,099
of the core of citizen labs work in a

171
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,580
lot of ways so this technology is often

172
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,719
called dual use technology based on the

173
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,740
sensible view that there are legitimate

174
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:58,620
use cases for tools that filter sensors

175
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,270
survey monitor people but the technology

176
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,649
is also used to facilitate you know as

177
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,159
we know really profound human rights

178
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:06,570
abuses so in April of this year citizen

179
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,240
lab released a major report called

180
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,099
planet net sweeper focused on a Canadian

181
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,380
made technology called net sweeper which

182
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,770
is used for institutional filtering work

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,740
mostly in North America so things like

184
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,229
so that libraries don't have access to

185
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,759
pornography right but it's also sold to

186
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,979
nation state level ISPs in many

187
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,139
countries we identified 30 countries and

188
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,849
we did a smaller sample of ten specific

189
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,469
ones where there were particularly

190
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:35,159
significant international human rights

191
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:37,529
law issues our technical team found that

192
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,260
net sweeper technology was being used to

193
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,299
filter religious content in rain

194
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,620
political speech and campaigns in the

195
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,810
UAE journalism and Yemen and

196
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,240
particular a large chunk of LGBTQ

197
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,489
related content that was either

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,560
miscategorized or over categorized as

199
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,630
quote-unquote alternative lifestyles and

200
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
that was a list that that is a list that

201
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,620
net sweeper itself is engaged in

202
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,480
curating to some degree which means that

203
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,210
things like access to information about

204
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,130
hiv/aids health information or even just

205
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,930
political advocacy around queer issues

206
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,400
is being censored in a large number of

207
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,589
countries and countries where those

208
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,180
populations are subject to significant

209
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,580
forms of repression and human rights

210
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,630
abuses so what's more is that the

211
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,160
Canadian government itself is

212
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,330
bankrolling this company to some degree

213
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,850
they're providing them research and

214
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,680
development funding they're taking them

215
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,960
on trade missions and this is you know

216
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,489
from our perspective a sort of

217
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,339
hypocritical issue for a government that

218
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,290
has largely promoted its commitment to

219
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,200
human rights and particularly to LGBTQ

220
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,420
groups you know minority groups and

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,710
women internationally so there's a

222
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,849
policy cohesion problem there um but

223
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,070
there's also this broader issue that

224
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,779
businesses have you know it's clear that

225
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,250
businesses have a responsibility to

226
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,410
respect human rights in the countries

227
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,029
where they're operating what's less

228
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,589
clear is how to actually hold them

229
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,660
accountable for those human rights

230
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,900
issues it's a tricky problem of

231
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,240
jurisdiction you know the way that we

232
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,000
treat for example mining or extractive

233
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,860
industries or you know companies that

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,779
use child labor or other types of human

235
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,089
rights issues aren't as well translated

236
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,160
in the technological context and we need

237
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,860
to start building out that legal

238
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,930
infrastructure and we just haven't yet

239
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,410
the other front I want to talk about in

240
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:23,170
some detail is uh you know the messiest

241
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,430
issues in emerging speech law in the

242
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:29,020
West are really questions around

243
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,430
remedies legal remedies and and I guess

244
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,910
the way to do that is to tell you a

245
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,829
little story

246
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,459
well actually here's the thing right we

247
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,959
have this idea that the debate in the

248
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,279
West or on freedom of expression is

249
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,750
really about what the nature of the

250
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
right is and there is this mythology

251
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,010
that the United States because of the

252
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,490
First Amendment has this very sort of

253
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,950
pure free speech absolutist position and

254
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,020
that you know the EU there's sort of a

255
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,390
spectrum where the EU is more

256
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,040
constrained around issues like hate hate

257
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,250
speech or reputation as we see in the

258
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,199
right

259
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,120
be forgotten debate I'm not convinced

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,680
that's true at all I think that it's

261
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,510
just a different set of values that are

262
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,000
being protected in the US legal context

263
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:10,360
and those are in particular morals

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,210
around sexuality which is how we see the

265
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,130
mass censorship through legislation like

266
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,640
susta fausto which PFF is doing a lot of

267
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,410
campaigning around as well as copyright

268
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,590
which you know like the DMCA is one of

269
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,060
the most powerful you know content

270
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,950
removal tools there is from a legal

271
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,079
perspective so I think that we just need

272
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,220
to think about that that that really

273
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,350
there's sort of a debate about the

274
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,450
rights but the bigger Messier more

275
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,550
problematic to me is actually around the

276
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,860
remedies what you do to enforce those

277
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,740
rights when they're brought to a court

278
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,510
so there's a case called Equus tech and

279
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,940
and to really highly simplify it

280
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,230
essentially a couple years ago there was

281
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,070
a case in a British Columbia that's a

282
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,320
Canadian Court where the defendant

283
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,580
basically ripped off was accused of

284
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,530
ripping off some networking equipment

285
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,420
running away from a previous employer

286
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,130
starting their own company and they were

287
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,430
sued for breach of trade secret

288
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,600
so it's an intellectual property right

289
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,459
essentially the defendant either never

290
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,290
showed up or sort of stopped appearing

291
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,480
in court sort of started running a

292
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,900
clandestine business was not available

293
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,089
to appear and and it was impossible to

294
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,380
take take their services online so they

295
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,990
were just basically selling these kind

296
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,750
of ripoff like sort of router type

297
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,550
devices the plaintiff essentially seeks

298
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,500
an injunction to stop them from doing

299
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,260
business online right as part of an

300
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,390
interlocutory remedy so the court Awards

301
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,920
this remedy but the defendant is nowhere

302
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,810
to be found the court can't enforce the

303
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,349
order and they keep engaging in the

304
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,849
offending activity so then the plaintiff

305
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,830
goes to the court and seeks an

306
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,110
injunction against Google to have Google

307
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,050
removed search results related to this

308
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,970
business worldwide so Google had already

309
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,229
been doing voluntary enforcement for

310
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,300
dossier but they're like well look our

311
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,680
businesses international enforce this

312
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,040
injunction internationally against

313
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,750
Google so you know this ends up being

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,219
really a case about the remedy itself

315
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,810
that it goes all the way to the Canadian

316
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,000
Supreme Court the Canadian Supreme Court

317
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,768
ultimately upholds the injunction

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,749
against Google worldwide and then Google

319
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,639
has just quite recently gone to a US

320
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:12,920
Court to ask for sort of an exemption

321
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,439
from the ruling of the Supreme Court in

322
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,300
Canada if that makes sense so it's

323
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,769
really like the most complex messy

324
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,118
conflict of laws problem that you can

325
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,009
get and really it's a debate about you

326
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:24,949
know if we accept that a Canadian Court

327
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:27,799
can tell Google what to do and what

328
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:30,799
content to show people worldwide do we

329
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,319
also accept that a Turkish court or a

330
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,239
Bangladeshi Court or a British Court can

331
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:36,979
decide what other people can see

332
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:39,379
worldwide so it's a question of really

333
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,129
on one hand the risk of a bulky noised

334
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,959
intranet or on the other the risk that

335
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,459
there's sort of a global race to the

336
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,768
bottom in terms of freedom of expression

337
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,809
and both are terrible outcomes and the

338
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,639
law does not have fantastic solutions

339
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,779
for how to deal with it so I think that

340
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,579
this is something that's worth keeping

341
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,019
on the agenda we often have this idea

342
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:01,910
these panels often get to like

343
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,929
censorship is bad you know great you

344
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,579
know but we really have to start

345
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,019
thinking at the technical level at the

346
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,399
legal level at the political level how

347
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,470
we're going to sort of negotiate these

348
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,240
complex value problems as well

349
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,429
and I guess on the last piece I just I

350
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,839
want to say that the encryption debate

351
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:20,449
is far from over you know at a legal

352
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,220
level there are new efforts in courts

353
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:24,378
every day in countries like Canada and

354
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,589
the US and the UK to expand powers to

355
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,970
compel people to disclose passwords

356
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,429
Australia has new proposed legislation

357
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,899
and that's extremely problematic and so

358
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,980
when we talk about censorship we also

359
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,290
really have to think about the

360
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,699
technological mechanisms that help

361
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,139
guarantee people's fundamental rights

362
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,209
and freedoms on the Internet and that

363
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,549
includes tools like tor it includes

364
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:47,179
encryption tools and in particular

365
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,839
end-to-end encryption so yeah thanks for

366
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:52,490
thanks Alex

367
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,949
Sergey hello thank you for coming my

368
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,809
name is Sergey Favre and I'm a PhD

369
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:59,859
student at University of Colorado in

370
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:02,660
Boulder where we research various

371
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,600
practical ways to actually circumvent

372
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,509
censorship my main academic project is

373
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,569
refraction networking family of the

374
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:16,279
circumvention tools and it tries to move

375
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,779
routers in the middle circumvention

376
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,120
routers into the middle of the network

377
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,970
so if we get depot

378
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,589
the friendly is peace then it would be

379
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,240
much much easier to circumvent

380
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:32,300
censorship because requests to arbitrary

381
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,920
websites various websites that have any

382
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:39,109
routers of refraction networking on the

383
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,689
path then we would be able to catch

384
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,690
their specially tagged requests and

385
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,510
start practicing does circumventing the

386
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,480
censorship so I'd like to talk about

387
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,689
some recent events that happened in

388
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,970
various countries can you start right

389
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,730
sure

390
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:06,110
okay so one fun story is how Russia

391
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:09,200
blocked Google and Amazon IP addresses

392
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:12,200
at some point they were blocked up to 16

393
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,770
million IP addresses which is a huge wad

394
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,560
currently I think it's like something

395
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,050
3.5 million IP addresses ostia wat but

396
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:27,250
the gist of the situation was that they

397
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:30,650
were basically trying to force Google to

398
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,670
collaborative them via trying to ban

399
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,980
telegram

400
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,939
so telegram would just you know do usual

401
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:41,209
things like switch VMS and get new IP

402
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,370
addresses and sensors for work if you

403
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,560
don't want to hunt those IP addresses

404
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,160
one by one we just want to block the

405
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:56,000
whole sub networks and they did and

406
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:59,510
eventually and yeah at some point at

407
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,660
some point they said Google and Amazon

408
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:12,129
caved to some of the network some of the

409
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:14,689
sensors demands yeah this part so and

410
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,050
does anyone know what the main front in

411
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,630
case yeah a lot of people so the main

412
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,389
front sink was a very crucial defense

413
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,059
against enumeration attacks right

414
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,270
so imagine tools like tor they have some

415
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:32,300
public they have some public entries

416
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,760
then they have bridges that are sort of

417
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,620
private

418
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,370
there remains an issue of how to deliver

419
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,370
those bridges to users and not the

420
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,979
sensors and turns out this is a really

421
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,649
really hard problem and you have to have

422
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,290
lots of bridges which they don't have to

423
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,840
do that efficiently but the main

424
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:57,139
fronting the main front think about user

425
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,780
to establish connection say to cgn or to

426
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,450
google.com and through Google comm you

427
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,760
could like it would walk to a sensor

428
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,430
like you're established in connection to

429
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,879
google.com because you're using its IP

430
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:15,590
address and Google comm in subject name

431
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,920
indication but then you would request

432
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:24,290
your hostname and yeah you could set up

433
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,600
practicing this way and your your your

434
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,600
ranging from Google something like my

435
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,100
proxy dot appspot.com but you go to

436
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,760
Google and then from Google you go to

437
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,379
your proxy and then out and this was a

438
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,720
crucial defense against enumeration

439
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,700
attacks because now sensor sees that

440
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,900
request goes to google.com but that

441
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,530
couldn't just start walking

442
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,860
oh the google.com addresses and this was

443
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,190
an issue for for sensors for a couple of

444
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:55,419
years but the main fronting is almost

445
00:18:52,190 --> 00:19:00,110
dead at this point and as the slide says

446
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:02,870
Amazon and Google turned it off it still

447
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:06,949
works at Asia but I wouldn't hold my

448
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:11,290
breath on that remain in the case and

449
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:13,730
yeah the repercussions were horrible

450
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,830
domain for NSYNC is one of the two

451
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:20,720
current main transport for tor one of

452
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,230
them is office for which is also and the

453
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:29,150
wife and the other one is Mick which

454
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,830
uses domain fronting and yeah so Nick me

455
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,530
Google wasn't an option for a year I

456
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:37,250
think but Mick Amazon was an option

457
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,590
until very recently and tor isn't the

458
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,020
only one who was using domain fronting

459
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,049
for circumvention for example signal was

460
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,789
using it as well and as you can see

461
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:52,639
then so first signal was used in the

462
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,559
main France in Amazon's premises no at

463
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:56,869
Google's premises then they got kicked

464
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,879
out then they went to Amazon then they

465
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:03,649
got kicked out then too so yeah

466
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:06,350
eventually as you can see maxi just turn

467
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:10,549
it off then yeah no sir convention for

468
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:12,320
you as I mentioned key property of the

469
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,690
main Franzen was enumeration attack

470
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,359
existence and I want to talk a bit about

471
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:22,999
how can we replace it now so snowflake

472
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:27,980
is a new currently under active

473
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:33,649
development pluggable transports for

474
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:35,960
tour and yeah funny thing is is that it

475
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:39,619
was revised on the moon France Incan

476
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,619
some way but yeah they are funding some

477
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:46,488
other ways to the surrender world and so

478
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:51,049
after this first initial request current

479
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:54,919
would get no let's go from the other way

480
00:20:51,049 --> 00:21:00,739
so snowflake is a way to get massive

481
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:03,609
amount of short-lived proxies when users

482
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:08,950
would go to a website that serves as a

483
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:13,549
snowflake broker they would establish

484
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,389
web RTC connections to the clients to

485
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,700
the users in sense of countries and

486
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:22,570
since we are now and this would be

487
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,980
brokered by the set by the central

488
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:31,269
snowflake blocker and yeah client and

489
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:34,580
volunteers would talk over WebRTC and

490
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:38,359
there are many there are potentially

491
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,970
many volunteers it is very easy to set

492
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,269
up so it would be impractical for censor

493
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,580
to block the IP addresses now there are

494
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,129
some fingerprint ability issues but we

495
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,678
hope those are untraceable one of the

496
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:53,330
just jump in quickly one of the critical

497
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,730
things to mention is web RTC is the

498
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,810
protocol that a lot of video chat uses

499
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,790
for peer-to-peer technology so if

500
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:03,030
are doing a Google Hangouts or other

501
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,879
video chat this is becoming a one of the

502
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,889
more common ways that to end-user

503
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,200
devices will do a video chat directly

504
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,730
between each other so the thought with

505
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,960
snowflake is allowing arbitrary data of

506
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,460
potentially censored content to flow

507
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,020
over those same channels and look like

508
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,640
you're having a video chat with some

509
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,730
random user in an uncensored country

510
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,400
before it enters you know its final

511
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,880
destination yeah

512
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,420
tor actually had a similar transplant

513
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,760
before mmm it was called first proxy but

514
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,730
it had a shortcoming of not been able to

515
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,590
shove coins behind not and all the coins

516
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:45,750
are behind not so and yeah snowflake

517
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,760
addressed this issue by using WebRTC I

518
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,710
also want to talk about refraction

519
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,910
networking which is academic project

520
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,730
that we are working on so as I've

521
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:02,720
mentioned the idea is that user requests

522
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:06,450
a blocked website it gets coin software

523
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,880
requests any reachable side and thus

524
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,730
option here is that there are key some

525
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,760
American websites that are allowed in

526
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,550
censored country let's see if this

527
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,920
assumption holds then sensor allows this

528
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:25,830
request to pass through their filters

529
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:28,710
the border but then our our router that

530
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:32,189
is going to be at OSP partner I explain

531
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:38,760
our CDN anywhere on the network it's

532
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:41,370
gonna detect the hidden tag that is that

533
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,430
was stay port of the request and yeah

534
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,159
could reject requests to the blocked

535
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:51,090
sites I wouldn't go into details about

536
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,700
cryptography of you know decrypting this

537
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:57,659
hidden tag and how can we do it while

538
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,640
sensor couldn't but yeah please do find

539
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:05,490
me after this talk of you're curious and

540
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:08,370
I would yeah and another way to to

541
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,740
overcome the challenge of numeration

542
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,389
attacks is to just push for massive

543
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:20,220
deployment of easily easily deployable

544
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:21,390
and usable private practice there are a

545
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,510
couple of options

546
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:27,420
as of today so you could use private

547
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:30,510
bridge which isn't exactly the easiest

548
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,000
solution but it's yeah the most

549
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,090
anonymous one the results out when by

550
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
jigsaw which is a Google incubator and

551
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,459
yeah the shadow sucks underneath it and

552
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,270
I think out Wayne is the leader in

553
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:49,730
usability among those few there's also

554
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:54,210
Streisand VPN it supports a lot of great

555
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:57,600
great transport underneath there's also

556
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:00,570
caddy forward proxy and the benefit of

557
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:06,090
fort proxy is that you are actually

558
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:08,600
you're now actually using HTTPS and it

559
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,820
helps you to stay under the radar of the

560
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,360
sensor because sensor is usually sort of

561
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,520
whitelist HTTPS as opposed to randomly

562
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,229
looking protocols like shadow sucks up

563
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:27,570
fuss for yeah that's great

564
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:29,850
so thanks everyone I think there were a

565
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,960
bunch of questions that came up well I

566
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,669
think there's a couple that we should

567
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,010
maybe touch on as a panel before we open

568
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:38,550
it up to to sort of broader audience

569
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,410
questions maybe one of the first ones is

570
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,629
if people want to sort of quickly talk

571
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,910
about why they see this as mattering to

572
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:48,000
them I think all of us ended up here

573
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,230
because you know we care about this

574
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,940
field of censorship and freedom of

575
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,150
expression and and one of the things

576
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,800
that maybe helps relate that is just

577
00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:02,520
sort of like what what got us each of us

578
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:04,919
into this well I'm Iranian so by default

579
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,870
vendors some political events happen to

580
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,640
Iran everybody approached me and asked

581
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,629
me to ask my friends in Iran to help

582
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,410
them drawn measurement

583
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:18,890
for them so almost 2012 or so

584
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:21,390
actually long before but anyway I

585
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,780
started to think about the problem

586
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,970
differently I questioned why we asked in

587
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,000
users and activists in different region

588
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,190
to participate in a measurement isn't it

589
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,750
is there any way that we can do

590
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,170
measurements from infrastructure

591
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,230
machines from the government own machine

592
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,510
things like that so that first we don't

593
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:47,660
need to find people of it in countries

594
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,660
also I didn't wanted to jeopardize the

595
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,700
like privacy of the activists within the

596
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:57,179
country by asking them to run a software

597
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,200
that is easy to fingerprint so we

598
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:04,920
started on that project at 2012 and

599
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,480
almost just in August first we are going

600
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,450
to deploy the project called sensor

601
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:14,450
planet it's it's run measurement from

602
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:19,020
router Open DNS resolvers echo servers

603
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:21,650
HTTP servers all with a condition that

604
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,440
they belong to the government or their

605
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:27,930
infrastructure or organizational vantage

606
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,210
points and that way we don't need to

607
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:37,230
depend on participation and we reduce

608
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,150
the risk we have more coverage globally

609
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:42,300
for each of our techniques we can have

610
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:46,200
more than 50000 management around for

611
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,570
almost 190 countries and then we also

612
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,820
can run the measurement continually

613
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,270
because we don't depend on participation

614
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,270
so the measurement can be weekly collect

615
00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:01,170
the data and the goal of the project is

616
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,600
to hopefully become one of the

617
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,640
censorship data repository where

618
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,040
activist political scientists social

619
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,480
scientists come to us or even computer

620
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,550
scientists come to us and say that hey

621
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,400
we need a data about tcp/ip reach

622
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,530
ability for this region and we need it

623
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,610
for the past year and we can provide

624
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:22,800
that this is a project that does measure

625
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:26,639
internet censorship separately

626
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,620
from vantage point yeah different type

627
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,330
of vantage point and another good

628
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,280
example I want to give a shout out to

629
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,909
them is only for example only does a

630
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,920
great job into involving participations

631
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,720
from the volunteers around the world and

632
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,890
they basically the data they're

633
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,810
collecting is a little bit different

634
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,410
from us so we are coordinating and

635
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:48,330
trying to change the landscape awesome

636
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,160
and so only the open Observatory of

637
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,449
network interference is within the Tor

638
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,920
project and they'll be talking right

639
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,570
after this in the state of the onion so

640
00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:03,740
if you want more on that you can stick

641
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:08,159
around so yeah I have free internet and

642
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:11,280
it but there's more to it than just

643
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:14,750
being annoyed when governments tells you

644
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,790
what you can and cannot read right it's

645
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,200
it would suck to live in the world where

646
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:28,170
there is overly balkanized

647
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:31,260
internet and and you couldn't get access

648
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,240
to the information from the other chunks

649
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,800
of the internet and it would lead to

650
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:39,990
pretty bad country conscious as far as

651
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:44,730
like international relations go right

652
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:47,820
because you would see that the same

653
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,200
events would be covered very differently

654
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,320
in different parts of the internet and

655
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,750
if only information you can get is all

656
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,379
those guys are really bad and those guys

657
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,660
get you know the reverse it can generate

658
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,580
a lot of heat the current situation is

659
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,140
certainly not ideal but at least you

660
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:14,879
have a chance to figure truth out and I

661
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:16,290
want to keep that yeah I mean my own

662
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,400
motivations for doing this work aren't

663
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:23,520
aren't particularly exciting no don't

664
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,920
get those wet but I can't talk a little

665
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,889
bit about what what what values drive my

666
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,720
perspective in this work I think human

667
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,760
rights law historically has been has

668
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,869
emerged from a very liberal

669
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,469
individualized tradition that doesn't

670
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:40,879
recognized fundamentally that

671
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:44,209
marginalised and disadvantaged groups

672
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:46,248
are both disproportionately impacted by

673
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:48,139
this kind of infrastructure of technical

674
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,609
control and also suffered

675
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:52,758
disproportionate consequences as a

676
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:55,309
result and so I feel like in my work

677
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,190
it's really significant to to foreground

678
00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:00,949
those issues to point out that the types

679
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:04,219
of content and the types of information

680
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:05,749
that end up being censored are often you

681
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:08,539
know that of political resistance

682
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:10,249
movements you know movements towards

683
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,289
social justice indigenous justice

684
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:14,749
women's rights reproductive rights

685
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:16,879
health care issues that these are the

686
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:19,549
types of things that are being censored

687
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:22,009
and and that those actually really need

688
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:23,269
to be part of the core discourse from a

689
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:25,279
human rights perspective from a

690
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:27,379
political perspective I think that it's

691
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,389
been a bit unfortunate that there's been

692
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:31,849
a bit of this like sorry like whiteboy

693
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,529
First Amendment framework for thinking

694
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:36,049
about freedom of expression because

695
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:38,929
there's a rich terrain there that I

696
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,549
think will bring many more people into

697
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:42,049
this issue and I think that that's at

698
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,399
the core of what matters to me and I

699
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,959
guess there's maybe this piece around

700
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:46,428
equality too that we want to look for it

701
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:49,999
yeah I mean I think that definitely ties

702
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:52,789
in which is and and maybe one one other

703
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:56,239
sort of thing to point out in terms of

704
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:57,979
the transition as part of this is if if

705
00:31:56,239 --> 00:32:00,499
we were to give this talk I don't know

706
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:01,609
five or ten years ago when we talked

707
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:03,889
about censorship we would really be

708
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:06,168
talking about almost an extra legal

709
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:08,208
nation-state what our repressive regimes

710
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:10,819
blocking yeah and the conversation has

711
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:13,879
evolved a lot in the West so much of our

712
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:15,379
content is in platforms right there's

713
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:16,849
there's not as many people who host

714
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:18,678
their own blogs and so it's about is

715
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:20,329
Facebook moderating your stream and in

716
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,759
what way we now have a conversation

717
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:24,198
about fake news we've really reframed a

718
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,299
lot of what we mean by censorship and

719
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:30,169
access to information and we're having

720
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:32,149
to cope with this public private space

721
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:35,809
where we're the spaces that we are

722
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:38,958
engaging in discourse are not Commons in

723
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,359
a in a pure way but are within some

724
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:43,519
corporate framework and so we have to

725
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,819
tackle this question of what is Internet

726
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,830
freedom and what is equality you guys

727
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:51,080
have I think that's probably

728
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,908
touching on a little bit more yeah I

729
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,500
mean I think that I've been thinking a

730
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:57,409
lot about this around the Sesto faster

731
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,309
to be right what you know which is

732
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:02,510
really legislation just for it for folks

733
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:04,668
who are maybe not from the US or not

734
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,010
following along legislation that's been

735
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:10,159
proposed to ostensibly to prevent human

736
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,080
trafficking but also covers the use of

737
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,110
the Internet to promote or facilitate

738
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,090
prostitution is a language and and in

739
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,529
particular makes intermediaries far more

740
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,240
responsible for the content they're

741
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,130
hosting on their platforms and really up

742
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,850
ends the very careful balance that's

743
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,559
been struck by CDA 230 and I think that

744
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,199
what's interesting about this is that

745
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:34,279
the this sort of mass public uproar one

746
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,690
would expect is is relatively absent and

747
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,370
and maybe that's because we're really

748
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,159
mostly talking about the rights of women

749
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,110
and sex workers and I think that's a

750
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,549
tragedy and I also think that there's

751
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,629
really a missed opportunity here it's

752
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:47,149
something I feel like I said like a

753
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,309
thousand times this year is that women

754
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:51,260
have other rights beyond being safe on

755
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:52,760
the internet like women are human and

756
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,309
have human rights like speech and

757
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,590
privacy you know and like we need to

758
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:59,629
stop thinking about these issues as some

759
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,120
sort of balancing act or trade-off but

760
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:05,179
rather as an exercise in affirming and

761
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,889
protecting all kinds of speech on the

762
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,839
internet so I think you know that's

763
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:15,259
that's one dimension that I think is is

764
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:17,629
often really left behind so I cannot

765
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,310
touch on philosopher philosophy called

766
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:23,540
part of Internet freedom but I'm gonna

767
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:27,639
just say from a networking perspective I

768
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:30,349
think Internet freedom is to me when

769
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,540
somehow like natural Altea stuff

770
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:35,389
basically if the network traffic is

771
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:39,759
being disrupted by any means I want that

772
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,760
to be transparent to users into

773
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:47,598
basically to everybody everybody so I

774
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,759
think you're free to as a user you

775
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,940
should be have this freedom to know who

776
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,960
is learning about your communication and

777
00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:00,020
if there is some monitoring there's

778
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,200
tampering or blocking you need to have a

779
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:06,359
very good real

780
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,328
information about it and and we I'm

781
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,160
gonna just a little bit and they keep

782
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:13,710
talking about Internet censorship as a

783
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,960
locking and I think that's that's a

784
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,730
because it's very easy to detect when

785
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,380
the communication is disrupt and you

786
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:22,170
don't see what you need supposed to see

787
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,230
so like detecting that phenomena is

788
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:30,359
really easy but internet surveillance or

789
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:36,810
monitoring is much much harder to detect

790
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:39,710
and therefore much more common and so

791
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:42,750
yeah that's also another perspective

792
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,349
awesome so we are getting pretty close

793
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,540
to like ten minutes for questions why

794
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:51,150
don't we each take a few minutes or just

795
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,070
like one minute maybe each to serve wrap

796
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,680
up with final thoughts before we open it

797
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,500
up to discussion so that we still have

798
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,890
time for that I guess I I didn't want to

799
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,270
end maybe with my piece by following on

800
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,890
to what Roy was just saying which is

801
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,349
there's this access thing in terms of

802
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,180
how we talk about censorship one of the

803
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:14,760
things that has been true and continues

804
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,660
to be true is that advocacy around

805
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,859
accountability and transparency are the

806
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,950
conversation where you can be more

807
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:25,170
successful often that that it's really

808
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,640
much easier to argue that if there is

809
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,560
censorship it's a censorship that needs

810
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,000
to be accountable to the people that we

811
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,619
need to know what it is that list should

812
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,180
be public and we need to be able to

813
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,220
enforce and monitor and have

814
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,839
accountability that the content we can

815
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,419
see is within our legal framework and is

816
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:41,250
a conversation we can have and that's

817
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,109
getting there I think that that in many

818
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,630
places there are now legal frameworks

819
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:47,160
that drive this and that means that

820
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,349
there is a remedy there's a way that you

821
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,230
can it has a society and as as

822
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:54,420
individual nations like have that

823
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,859
conversation in the open at least which

824
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,970
is better than it being completely

825
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:01,828
opaque it's not perfect but it's one

826
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,980
place that that we are sort of getting

827
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,980
there

828
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:14,410
though I i'd like to in my final what

829
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:17,200
I'd like to just encourage you to help

830
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:21,580
with the internet censorship if you have

831
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,189
research resources of or sometime so

832
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:29,650
currently tor spoke about transport

833
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:31,420
effort is heavily defunded and I'm sure

834
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,830
they would accept any help they could

835
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:37,750
get I would also have some help on

836
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,790
refraction networking stuff specifically

837
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:45,250
we are trying to get more deployments

838
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:48,310
and if you could get your University for

839
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,140
example to deploy us that would be

840
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:59,440
really great and we could research

841
00:37:50,140 --> 00:38:02,049
together and write some papers yeah I

842
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,150
guess just sort of to your point Priya I

843
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,380
think it's also just important to

844
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,840
remember that the technical

845
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,850
infrastructure of censorship is often

846
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,370
the same or very closely related

847
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:15,130
infrastructure for surveillance and that

848
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,620
these are both pieces of the same puzzle

849
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,180
around information controls and that we

850
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,029
have to contextualize them as part of a

851
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,069
larger debate around like what it really

852
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,920
means to be free in the 21st century and

853
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,140
and also I'm understanding that these

854
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,190
technologies you know may not be you

855
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,720
know foolproof or emancipatory or

856
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:38,320
perfect solutions but that they create a

857
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,319
sort of necessary friction you know that

858
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,600
that makes certain kinds of freedom more

859
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,160
possible and I think that you know I was

860
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,110
reluctant to talk about what values are

861
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,640
really like driving me in this debate

862
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,590
but I think that's that's really at the

863
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,220
core of it and that's a piece that I

864
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:58,050
think we shouldn't lose and for closing

865
00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:03,060
remark I want to emphasize that with the

866
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:05,200
focus with the networking groups and

867
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,960
coming up with better techniques to

868
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,879
manage network and the cheap prices for

869
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,040
the deep packet inspection

870
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,020
we're dealing with a bigger adversary

871
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:19,680
and and therefore I'm very excited

872
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:22,490
to see that the civil society activist

873
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,100
academia everybody has been pushing for

874
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:29,669
research in this regard or transparency

875
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,830
in a push for transparency and I'm

876
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,960
actually very optimistic and I want to

877
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:37,049
thank all of you guys it is a lab only

878
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,950
everybody that they are going out of

879
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,220
their ways to juggle marketing at the

880
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,839
same time working researching

881
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,319
communicating trying to bring the

882
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,470
community together yeah you're we're

883
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,060
fighting a good fight great so we do

884
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:58,169
have some time for questions I believe

885
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:01,620
there's a microphone so why don't we see

886
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:04,410
if we get people coming up to it and and

887
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:07,170
just I will repeat the question but try

888
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:10,140
and keep it to a single question that we

889
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:14,940
can can answer with a question mark at

890
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:19,830
the end regular comments

891
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,660
okay so we'll you mentioned that there

892
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,160
were we're sort of expanding the

893
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,629
conversation about what censorship is

894
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,799
and particularly you mentioned fake news

895
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,560
and I wonder if you could talk about

896
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,900
that some more yeah awesome so the

897
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,740
question is about fake news and and this

898
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:40,830
sort of current debate about about you

899
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:42,629
know official content about what about

900
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,509
views and and really what this goes into

901
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,940
right is that as soon as we go away from

902
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:51,030
purely access we end up with a much more

903
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,100
nuanced debate and this question of okay

904
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,720
so maybe there's this one thing of free

905
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,610
speech if I'm in a conversation with one

906
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,990
other person we can talk about whether I

907
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,910
should be allowed to say stuff and what

908
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,649
bounds are there and then there's the

909
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,120
second question of what are my

910
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,790
responsibilities in giving you a

911
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,549
platform to advertise and promote

912
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,870
yourself and and where are the limits

913
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,200
there and that's a very different

914
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:15,150
conversation right you know are you know

915
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,529
what legal protections we have are yeah

916
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,390
you can say this but I don't have to

917
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,580
promote it or like support you in saying

918
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,350
it I don't want to necessarily hear an

919
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,180
extremist voice viewpoint and especially

920
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,830
as we end up with this tangled web where

921
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,690
most of the content that we're posting

922
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,069
your Facebook stream is definitely

923
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,550
curated and

924
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:36,210
Facebook gets to have a curation role in

925
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:38,370
choosing what they promote and so that

926
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,380
has now led to this much more nuanced

927
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,540
conversation and I think it's a place

928
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,130
that we are in a much worse place in

929
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,259
being able to measure because it is so

930
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,840
personalized there's not a single global

931
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,550
view for anyone and so there's much less

932
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,740
ability for us to have accountability

933
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,080
it's unclear if that's something that we

934
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,270
can get purely technically in my opinion

935
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,890
that's gonna be a mix again of needing

936
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:02,070
to catch up in terms of our policy and

937
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,839
legal regimes to have regulation and

938
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,210
accountability there because it's not

939
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,800
something that I can easily check for

940
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,660
others that's that I'd love to be proven

941
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,280
wrong if people want to develop tools to

942
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,520
you know be able to monitor their own

943
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,050
streams for the certain manipulation I

944
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,610
want to add something when it comes to

945
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,190
tech news this scares me a little bit

946
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:21,660
because and some African countries for

947
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,400
example if you have incidents that the

948
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,370
government use DMCA as a way of

949
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,750
controlling the or removing content so

950
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,430
when it comes to thickness I'm always

951
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,860
asking who is gonna make a call into the

952
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:36,000
fake news and that person who's making a

953
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:38,220
call is it needs to be trustworthy my

954
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,250
question thank you so much for this much

955
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,660
needed conversation I have a question

956
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,390
that was actually related to the last

957
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,890
one when we talk about censorship often

958
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,359
the assumption is that the Western

959
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,790
countries and the companies won't be

960
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,190
blocking the services so I'm

961
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:54,870
particularly worried that whenever sure

962
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,450
we need more transports more

963
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,700
technologies more more excuse me

964
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,319
protocols but when we want to deploy

965
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,089
these protocols we have to go to Amazon

966
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,150
you have to go to Google we have to go

967
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:08,160
to Microsoft and what if these I think

968
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:11,010
in in this political climate in the US

969
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,190
it's not crazy to to wonder what happens

970
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:16,230
if these companies if the if the Western

971
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,470
governments start to Detroit ain't ernet

972
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:26,190
and and they start to not let us to run

973
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:28,700
any of these proxies yeah I mean that

974
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,700
would be bad

975
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,180
I don't know that I have a compelling

976
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,500
answer to that question but I do want to

977
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,839
say there are people there are lots of

978
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,860
people in this room who work for Amazon

979
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:43,560
and Google and these types of larger

980
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:46,500
stacks where you know and you have a

981
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,509
responsibility right now as engineers as

982
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,920
software developers to be thinking about

983
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,680
these issues to be thinking about the

984
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,360
human rights you know the human rights

985
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,759
that are so intimately bound up with the

986
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,520
technologies you're building and and I

987
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,870
think take it on an advocacy role within

988
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,220
your own companies to prevent that

989
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,839
because there's only so much that can be

990
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,250
done from political pressure and

991
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,510
lobbying from the outside there's a lot

992
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,310
that can be done to the courts obviously

993
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,200
on these issues there are a lot of live

994
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:12,810
legal problems that play but those are

995
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,859
slow and complicated and costly and so I

996
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,660
think that we really need to start

997
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,060
thinking more now more than ever about

998
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:22,200
our responsibilities as you know as

999
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,060
makers of this technology and I would

1000
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,609
like to highlight that even though

1001
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,549
Amazon and Google killed the main

1002
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:32,550
financing the steel could be used for

1003
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,220
censorship circumvention they are glad

1004
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,690
to be doing this they just wanted

1005
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,990
enhanced protections against the main

1006
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:44,760
France Inc which was not necessarily

1007
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:46,979
that fair to them one point of course

1008
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,260
like these big companies have resources

1009
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:54,150
so we it's good that we can depend on

1010
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:56,370
them to some degree but and we need to

1011
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,860
count them responsible and I think one

1012
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:01,770
good example was when Apple didn't

1013
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:05,160
accept one of the app for that measured

1014
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:07,200
net net neutrality and they just said

1015
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,799
that they cannot put it in Apple Store

1016
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,740
but the designer of that I put it on

1017
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,380
Twitter and asked everybody to call them

1018
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,290
on it and I was thinking after one hour

1019
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,480
it was accepted and it was pushed

1020
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,220
because that reputation of a country can

1021
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,640
be questioned and that's what we should

1022
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,649
do

1023
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,750
I mean with respect to domain fronting I

1024
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,360
mean if Google or Amazon doesn't have a

1025
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:33,360
good reason for doing so I think they

1026
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:37,200
should be Colin but or if they have they

1027
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:39,780
should be transparent about it a

1028
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,169
follow-up for wheeler when you say that

1029
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,880
there are not ruler to

1030
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,190
and observation of the personalized

1031
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,490
stream there is actually and tomorrow as

1032
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,809
a rumor Richie at 20 there is a talk

1033
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,848
about it awesome

1034
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:55,150
also the question that I want to do on

1035
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:58,420
the same subject is that if you have a

1036
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,849
platform that creates for you the stream

1037
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,339
of the news you are getting as someone

1038
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:06,039
pasta a news and you never get it is

1039
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:07,869
this censorship can we call it

1040
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:10,510
algorithmic censorship or which kind of

1041
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:12,339
terminology we can find it right so the

1042
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,140
question is sort of okay as we get into

1043
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,538
individual like items of information a

1044
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,529
level up from internet transports and

1045
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:23,109
access is this in censorship right like

1046
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:24,549
news censorship is individual pieces of

1047
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:27,250
data or information that are getting

1048
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:28,720
taken out of newspapers back in the day

1049
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,819
that that's the tradition that this is

1050
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,799
coming from censorship has a long rich

1051
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:35,710
history this isn't a new phenomenon for

1052
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:37,180
the internet and and having things that

1053
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,069
people are attempting to post that don't

1054
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,808
make it to the audience definitely

1055
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:42,640
at some level especially when it doesn't

1056
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:46,210
make it at all is something that that we

1057
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,549
would say is censorship the the trick

1058
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,559
and the nuance is win it's just lower on

1059
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:52,599
the feet right it made it potentially

1060
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,069
it's just not highlighted or promoted

1061
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,319
and that's where we get into the the

1062
00:46:54,069 --> 00:47:00,009
tricky part right is is does this

1063
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:02,259
actually get the intention and does it

1064
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:04,509
does it fit with maybe the social norms

1065
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:06,670
and expectations of users and how do we

1066
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:08,799
have accountability about that and that

1067
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,869
and that's this this debate that we're

1068
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:14,140
just gonna keep coming back to and look

1069
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:15,789
for answers and policy around right yeah

1070
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,009
well I also just think that it's part of

1071
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,690
the sort of trick that happens where

1072
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:21,460
people treat things like Facebook's news

1073
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,259
feed or the Twitter algorithm is like a

1074
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,269
law of nature like it's gravity or

1075
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:27,130
something that information just flows in

1076
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:28,629
a particular way and so I think that we

1077
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,859
need to change the conversation except

1078
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,410
that these technologies even when

1079
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,750
they're opaque are a form of curation or

1080
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,399
moderation there that they embed values

1081
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,369
and political ideas about what's

1082
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,380
relevant what isn't you know and sort of

1083
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:42,700
once we unpack that a little bit it

1084
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,750
becomes easier to have a conversation

1085
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,939
about the issues raised okay I think we

1086
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,829
probably have time for one more question

1087
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,539
all right I'll try to make it good you

1088
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,859
know how people like to talk about like

1089
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,940
what's in your bag what's your daily

1090
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:57,490
carry in case

1091
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,140
weird what is on your computers or

1092
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:01,990
phones I know like Sarah gays slide

1093
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,390
showed a variety of tools is it just tor

1094
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,069
browser do you like a certain VPN how do

1095
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:08,259
you avoid like if you travel a lot like

1096
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:11,529
I do how do you what you're like loadout

1097
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,420
quick top ones great so the question is

1098
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,550
how do you stay safe with with personal

1099
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,210
digital security and how you keep access

1100
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:21,849
I bet a lot of us end up in sort of

1101
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,609
privileged positions in the I think all

1102
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:26,260
of us probably have academic

1103
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:29,980
affiliations of some form and and one of

1104
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:32,430
the tricks is that in many places an SSH

1105
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,839
connection or a VPN to your academic

1106
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:38,470
affiliation gets around a lot of

1107
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:40,900
blocking you know even even in China the

1108
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:43,779
the Internet to pipe connecting to the

1109
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:48,839
various educational institutions has has

1110
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:50,829
less of a latency Edition so so less

1111
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:52,390
technically sophisticated and censorship

1112
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:55,060
can work when you're connecting to an

1113
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:59,348
educational location than if you're just

1114
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:02,680
connecting out to a standard VPS so for

1115
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:04,810
me SSH to to a server that I own in a

1116
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,839
place that I trust works great as a

1117
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,250
bridge most of the time I will say that

1118
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,109
I when I'm traveling internationally

1119
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,200
I'll take a computer that doesn't have

1120
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:16,210
things that I consider sensitive so so

1121
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,828
an alternative set of technology for

1122
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,910
international travel that you're

1123
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:25,000
comfortable with is as useful and and

1124
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:27,220
then it's about understanding the local

1125
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,630
context of what you are getting into as

1126
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:37,899
much as anything so so each place has

1127
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:40,140
has its own specific problems great no

1128
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,140
worries

1129
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:50,769
thanks everyone

1130
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:50,769
[Applause]
