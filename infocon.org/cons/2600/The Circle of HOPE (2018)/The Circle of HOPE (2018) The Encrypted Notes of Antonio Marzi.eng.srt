1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,100
this is a story of when we were once

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,220
bored in Italy and we decrypted a bunch

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:16,590
of notes written by world war ii italian

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:21,119
spy in 2003 he wrote a letter and he are

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:25,500
asking if he were able to ask for l to

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,660
the crib notes he forgot how to decrypt

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,710
them attached to this letter there were

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,630
a bunch of papers with random letters

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:41,489
undone so this person who was this

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:46,590
person who was Antonio Mart see what

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:52,230
were two started in 1934 49 in a 1940's

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:56,280
I joined Germany and the Nazis and this

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,099
is one DEA's young guy at 16 comes in he

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,850
volunteers to be a radio operator in

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:07,549
Italian Royal Navy Thank You gains were

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,290
married cross doing Dutch then in 1943

17
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:15,509
Italy officially surrenders to the lies

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,759
that cans into southern Italy and start

19
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,189
occupying the territory it's worth

20
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,180
noting northern Italy was still occupied

21
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:29,039
by the Germans the ship were Marty was

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:32,729
in stored over in southern Italy and he

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,970
lands in Brindisi so there were not a

24
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:40,110
lot of people able to operate really big

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,298
radio so after a year he volunteers to

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:48,420
be parachuted behind enemy lines

27
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:52,200
internal Italy and transmit communicate

28
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:57,090
communicate notes to the Allies so he

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,509
was persuaded in Verona and then took a

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,630
bike and about a hundred twenty miles

31
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:10,590
with a forty pounds radio on his back so

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,109
he he landed in in order in 1944 and he

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,560
stayed

34
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:20,200
until the war finished in 1945 so after

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,980
they were finished he moved to Rome and

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,140
when he was about 80 he asked for help

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,030
to Delta to defeat those nodes because

38
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,489
he couldn't remember how to do that he

39
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,050
mentioned he also mentions his education

40
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,090
is a middle from a middle school

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:44,020
background and he has a terrible

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:47,970
handwriting note that is from 1940s we

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:51,120
done came in we found these notes on a

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,859
puzzle site called mystery twister and

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,040
since we had busy nothing to do we

46
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,850
decided to take a train cross all Italy

47
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:05,380
by train and pick them up yes there were

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,769
75 pages of incredible notes along the

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,040
75 pages of encrypted notes Marcy tried

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:15,940
to leave behind some instructions on how

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,880
to decrypt them he leaves this page with

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:24,930
a partial mapping between letters and

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:29,560
words five digit number of unclear use

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,230
some instructions on how to do a old

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,080
cipher called the columnar transposition

56
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:39,238
which is usually done with a key but

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,150
there is no suggestion of that in the

58
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,030
paper with his instructions and he just

59
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,190
scribbles a note saying that he really

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,709
hopes that this will be a helpful but he

61
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,019
can't remember anything else about what

62
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,500
he was doing when he was encrypting

63
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:58,330
those notes again by now he's 80 and

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,400
trying to remember what he was doing

65
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:10,269
when he was 1821 behind enemy lines

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,440
now something that we know about that

67
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:16,930
time is that the spies in behind enemy

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,849
lines were mostly organized by the

69
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,520
Special Operations Executive this is

70
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,909
secretary gence II formed in nineteen

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,299
for

72
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:32,200
with explicit mandate of set Europe

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,560
ablaze they take care of espionage and

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,349
sabotage in occupied Europe and they

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,710
provided training and help to the

76
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,080
resistance forces in the occupied

77
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,210
territories there were sometimes

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,450
referred to as the Ministry of

79
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:55,539
ungentlemanly warfare today we can find

80
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:59,020
their manual their training manuals in

81
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,320
the National Archives and there's a very

82
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,060
good republishing of the syllabus and

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,800
right between invisible inks and

84
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,840
innocent messages there is an

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,320
explanation of how to use the double

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,969
corner transposition to encrypt messages

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,670
by the way this is a fascinating

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,070
document covering topics from

89
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:31,090
cryptography to the art of silent

90
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:33,340
killing and how to hide on trees but the

91
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,049
part we're interesting in the secret

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,580
codes are covered more in depth in this

93
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,210
semi-autobiographical graphical book

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,969
between silk and china I'd written by

95
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:50,349
Leo Marx who was the head cryptographer

96
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:53,560
at the SOE and in that book he explains

97
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,380
how they had they moved on from these

98
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,960
ciphers that he refers to as poem codes

99
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,840
to one-time pads on silk the poem codes

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,049
used to work like this you would have a

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,810
key that would be a word or few words or

102
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,400
three words and you would use it to

103
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:18,190
figure out to order the columns of a

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,500
grid so for example you would take

105
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,630
cryptography as your key word for this

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,210
message and you would start going

107
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,830
through it in alphabetical order the

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,590
first letter in alphabetical order is

109
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,750
the a so that's going your first column

110
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,390
when you're doing the transposition and

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,039
then you continue through the alphabet

112
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,169
there's no B so we move on to C and

113
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,139
that's going to be the second column I'm

114
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:46,080
not going to talk through each step

115
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,889
don't worry but you can see how this

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,469
proceeds through every letter and all

117
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,869
the way to the Y the latest letter in

118
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:57,300
the alphabet in the word of which we

119
00:06:54,869 --> 00:07:02,930
have to so we number column 11 and

120
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:06,869
column 12 so now we have a order for 12

121
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,930
columns underneath that we write in a

122
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:11,339
grid our encrypted message for example

123
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,289
Antonio Marx he was persecuted in two

124
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,360
Italian territory under German

125
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,878
occupation this is what we want to

126
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,949
encrypt and then we follow the order we

127
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,349
just wrote at the top we start with the

128
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:25,229
first column and we read it as a column

129
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,050
and we write it down as a row this is

130
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:30,360
why columnar transposition the letters

131
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,270
of the encrypted messages are are the

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,719
same but they're in a different order so

133
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,758
we copy the first column then the second

134
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,099
column and the message is starting to

135
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,449
get scrambled because the order of these

136
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:47,279
columns come from a secret word we move

137
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,800
through the whole messages the whole

138
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,058
message until we copied all the words in

139
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,610
the all the columns in this plaintext

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:58,469
now if this were the entire cipher it

141
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,089
wouldn't be that hard to decrypt because

142
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,919
you can imagine that you have just have

143
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,959
to figure out where to make the cuts and

144
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,318
then you're playing calling their

145
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,659
anagrams you just have to figure out

146
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,300
which one goes first this gets

147
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,919
significantly safer against anyone

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,349
without the computer which at the time

149
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,990
was everyone if you do it twice so

150
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,490
double columnar transposition this is

151
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,879
the process to encrypt something with

152
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,370
this cipher at the core of the poem

153
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,539
codes and then usually the cipher text

154
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:36,959
was split into five letter groups to be

155
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,000
transmitted over telegraph so what this

156
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,149
is telling us is that these were not

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,329
notes from a journal or personal notes

158
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:48,329
but we're text pre encrypted to be

159
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:50,069
transmitted over radio the radio that he

160
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:53,339
was carrying

161
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:57,029
behind the Nan's alliance decryption

162
00:08:53,339 --> 00:09:00,180
works pretty much in Reverse you figure

163
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:04,320
out the secret word which we don't know

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,449
yet how and then you number the the

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,620
columns you write out the grid and you

166
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:11,959
copy things from rows to columns so far

167
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,490
so good

168
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:19,589
got the cipher okay

169
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,630
now what we used now we need to confirm

170
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,779
that that was indeed what Marty used

171
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,579
because this was just an assumption

172
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,540
based on what we knew about that so I

173
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:32,310
sorry we did that using something that

174
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,219
in modern cryptography you would call a

175
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,439
side channel in modern cryptography side

176
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,660
channels are timing attacks or power

177
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,990
consumption but in general there are

178
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,149
something that leaks information about

179
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,180
the functioning of a crypto system

180
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:52,649
beyond the output that it's supposed to

181
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,138
emit and while yeah side channels in

182
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:59,269
CPUs might be power consumption side

183
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:02,279
channels in Casa cryptography are dots

184
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,370
so those dots over there tell us

185
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,670
something about the the text can you

186
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,300
imagine why they're there there are not

187
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,610
periods semantically they are about the

188
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,760
he was writing a dot every time he was

189
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,630
copying a column from the other grid

190
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,720
which was lost into the the final

191
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,800
message so what this tells us is the

192
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,860
length of each column now if we count

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,930
the letters in each column that we

194
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,660
figured out from the dots in this

195
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,689
message for example they would be all 24

196
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,680
or 23 letters long except the first one

197
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:45,510
and the bottom one the the first one is

198
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,630
twenty nine characters last one is 28

199
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,209
all the other ones 24 and 23 why aren't

200
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:55,139
they all the same length because the

201
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:57,540
last row at the bottom is is incomplete

202
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,370
so columns that come to the right of

203
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,050
that will be one shorter than the

204
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,749
columns copied from the left-hand side

205
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,609
so this tells us that there's something

206
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:09,949
extraneous that doesn't come from the

207
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,689
plaintext in the ciphertext there's five

208
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,329
extra characters at the beginning and

209
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,949
five extra characters at the bottom we

210
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:19,040
don't know exactly where but they're in

211
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:22,670
the first column and in the last column

212
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,679
to be copied now looking close Merkel's

213
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:28,189
had other messages we start seeing

214
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,379
places where the first block was

215
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:33,439
forgotten we have reason to think that

216
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,509
it was probably the fourth block the

217
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:37,550
extraneous one because we have all these

218
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:40,069
messages where Heder went back and

219
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:44,389
scratched what he was copying to insert

220
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:48,199
these other letters or just forgot to

221
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:50,809
put them in and add them on top now for

222
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:54,979
example here we have we can think that

223
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:56,629
the letters H D X D are are from

224
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,179
something else than the plaintext

225
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,730
because they were weren't copied from

226
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:05,480
the grid in the previous round of the

227
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:08,029
transposition the position of the last

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,299
externus block instead is a bit harder

229
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,639
to find but some texts have a dot almost

230
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:15,949
at the end of the text leaving out only

231
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,129
one block of five letters so that

232
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:22,569
suggests that the last very very last

233
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:27,199
block is the extraneous one added on top

234
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:29,029
so something that you might know from

235
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,399
studying classic cryptography is that

236
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,860
usually there was a per message key or

237
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,160
per day key for example if you know

238
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,139
about the enigmas they often had Thurday

239
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,618
keys that were transmitted over more

240
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:44,839
long-term keys so it's reasonable to

241
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:46,910
think that those five extra letters are

242
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,339
somehow communicating the third message

243
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,129
key and they somehow lead to figuring

244
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,470
out the words to write at the top of the

245
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,809
thread to reorder the columns in the

246
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,480
right way

247
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:04,129
now the mortal sin of classic

248
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,610
cartography is kirei use and these two

249
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:10,610
messages written one above the other on

250
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:14,580
the same piece of paper have a

251
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,700
repetition if you can see it

252
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,730
the fourth block of the first message is

253
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,170
the last block of the second message and

254
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,700
visa versa

255
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:28,439
now one word in favor of Antonia Marcie

256
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,110
you have imagined that you're doing this

257
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,280
after getting trained for a few months

258
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,290
by these British people and the Nazis

259
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,660
are chasing you down and you will have

260
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,310
to transmit this with a radio that is

261
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:47,490
being tracked down with radio-cana

262
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:51,349
metric equipment to to find you and kill

263
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:55,290
you so yes this wasn't easy

264
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,760
so we also verified that the keys in is

265
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,490
the same in the two messages by

266
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,590
comparing the patterns of the dots they

267
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,140
come at the exact same positions in the

268
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:08,790
two messages but there's what so that

269
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,620
suggests that those two blocks are the

270
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,410
same thing they mean the same thing

271
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,900
because you can use them interchangeably

272
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,060
just encoded somehow differently we

273
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,180
don't know how yet there's a number of

274
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:27,390
messages that somehow reuse partial keys

275
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:30,839
or entire keys and in the SOA manual we

276
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:34,710
find a section that says to use some

277
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:38,460
personal number to encode the key that

278
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,460
you're using for each message and indeed

279
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,560
merci does write down that there was

280
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,610
this personal number five digits just

281
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,069
like the five letters so how this was

282
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,760
probably working is like with Caesar

283
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:56,700
ciphers where you take the alphabet and

284
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,920
you move off four positions in the

285
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,480
alphabet to change the letter so

286
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,900
probably the first letter would be moved

287
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:15,530
by for second by for third by seven nine

288
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:15,530
seven nine three nine now this would be

289
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,510
this would be reasonable to think but if

290
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,580
we try it with the alphabet like written

291
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,530
down in Marx's instruction it just

292
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,910
doesn't work it doesn't work with that

293
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,079
alphabet it doesn't work with that

294
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,579
Alfred without

295
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,579
re and ATO letters at the bottom so and

296
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:38,399
the words in here are also repeated

297
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:42,329
which is quite unlikely that he would

298
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:46,350
actually use words that repeat in a key

299
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:47,998
making the key weaker so we have to

300
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,759
think that there's something wrong in

301
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,970
the alphabet that he's using and in the

302
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,459
mapping towards but if we find a way to

303
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,579
go from two blocks of five letters to

304
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,529
the words that they map into those words

305
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,920
will probably be the key for the

306
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,829
transposition thankfully we have this

307
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:11,610
example on one of the pages this example

308
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:14,519
shows how to decode some key blocks but

309
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,529
it doesn't it doesn't use key blocks

310
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,699
that show up in any of the messages he

311
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:22,920
sent what we think happened is that he

312
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,859
was also receiving encrypted messages

313
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,009
with the same system and the same number

314
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,319
but of course he was doing the person in

315
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,499
Reverse and we somehow lost the

316
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:36,689
decryption of those messages so what we

317
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:38,610
have here is exactly what we want to

318
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,889
learn how to do how to use four four

319
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,600
seven three nine to turn the key at the

320
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,720
top into the key at the bottom to

321
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,889
decrypt a message in other words this is

322
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:54,809
a unit test and this is where computers

323
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:56,759
come in when you have to go doing wild

324
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,339
guesses about what the alphabet is and

325
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,410
what the mechanism is computers can do

326
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,880
that instantaneously you just write one

327
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:08,069
line of Python to test your your

328
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,669
assumption and then you run it against a

329
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:15,829
unit test and if it turns or gwv Q into

330
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:19,260
e be LF q'f bingo if it doesn't next try

331
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:22,709
now something we observed is that a lot

332
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,980
of the keys had letters that are not

333
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:31,409
present in the Italian alphabet Marcy

334
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:33,539
had in there sorry for the jump in over

335
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,370
here he only has letters from the

336
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:39,090
Italian alphabet you can see that

337
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:41,790
there's no K there's no J there's no X Y

338
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,189
and K the Italian alphabet

339
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,190
is five fewer letters than the English

340
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,860
alphabet but the letters are present in

341
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,170
the key so probably that was with the

342
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,990
first of his mistakes when recollecting

343
00:17:52,170 --> 00:18:00,090
how this worked and also we see that he

344
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:02,700
somehow was taking our e and ATO out but

345
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,070
we don't know exactly why there's little

346
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,980
nothing in the letter about why he wrote

347
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:12,750
Renato right now it turns out that this

348
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,950
is how you have to arrange the alphabet

349
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,880
for the decoding to work there are a and

350
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:24,620
8000 letters first and then all the

351
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,150
other letters from the English alphabet

352
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,010
and I'm not going to tell you how we

353
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,800
figure this out because there's not

354
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:36,810
really how because we just were trying

355
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:41,010
things until one stick and it stuck

356
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:43,020
because we have a unit test and if you

357
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,420
try it out yourself you can see that if

358
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,360
you take the o you go back four steps

359
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,260
you land on an E and then you take the G

360
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:57,600
go back four steps and you land on a b/w

361
00:18:52,260 --> 00:19:02,580
seven steps back lv3 steps back qq9

362
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:08,610
steps back f unit test pass we know what

363
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:11,730
the here so now that we know how to

364
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,919
decode the key we would expect them to

365
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,800
come out equal the first the one at the

366
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,210
top and one to begin and at the end of

367
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,840
the messages because we know they're

368
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,300
interchangeable they don't so these are

369
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,310
pairs each row is a single message

370
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,590
so they're both taken from the same

371
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:35,790
message can you see a way to make them

372
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:39,270
equivalent if you take out again our e

373
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,850
and ATO the letters that he left aside

374
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:44,610
without telling us why if you take them

375
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:48,149
out of these skis they are equivalent to

376
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:52,830
each other so that suggests that the

377
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,659
letters are e an ATO don't map to any

378
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,019
word they're just there to

379
00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:02,429
you make the key harder to figure out

380
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:04,739
their nose so if we now take this order

381
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:09,029
of the alphabet and we map the remaining

382
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:12,779
white letters to words from this key we

383
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:15,119
get probably finally the keys for the

384
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:18,359
transposition by the way these words

385
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,928
came from a poem and we came full circle

386
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,478
about why they're called poem codes

387
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,849
written by Allah our dolly our D it's a

388
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:30,179
snippet from the middle of one of the

389
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:32,279
county in Monticello and some of the

390
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,729
words were a bit different some of the

391
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,729
words were collapsed so we weren't we

392
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:41,129
didn't really have the whole key yet we

393
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:43,159
started seeing some cipher text

394
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:46,289
decrypting and some wouldn't

395
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,259
for example this message wasn't

396
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:52,529
decrypting with the mappings as he

397
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:56,220
suggested them and again we used our

398
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:58,440
dots the dots tell us the height of the

399
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,559
previous good because they tell us how

400
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,570
long each column is and if we know how

401
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,460
long each column is and we know how many

402
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,460
letters there on the message we also

403
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,099
know how wide it's going to be and the

404
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:15,090
width of the message is the length of

405
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:17,639
the key now see always mapped to Jo

406
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,249
Vanetta in map to drew Veneto but close

407
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:22,228
enough well P mapped to something

408
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:25,979
completely different and it was too

409
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:28,399
short for the size of that grid but the

410
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:32,389
letter that was supposed to map to cue

411
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:35,969
winter Otto would have been perfect so

412
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:37,469
not you sorry the letter before P so

413
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,590
what was happening is that there was

414
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,570
probably a missing letter the M was

415
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,908
mapping to something else and it was

416
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,039
just moving all the words one down in

417
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:50,519
the alphabet so that's Venter Otto would

418
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,460
fall on P so what's happening here is

419
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,590
that C turns into Joe veneto Peterson -

420
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,019
Sven - Otto we have the right width of

421
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,199
the grid we turned the grid into

422
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:04,589
ordering of the columns and we decrypt

423
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,600
the message circulars this measures

424
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:09,490
message was still not the correct

425
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,360
what was wrong about this one is that

426
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:17,380
the first column was short not long and

427
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:22,659
we knew that again from the dots and the

428
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:25,870
first column instead when we started the

429
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,530
curtain is this was said Giovanni with a

430
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,139
a on top of that red column a would have

431
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,730
made it the first column and but that

432
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,890
couldn't be right because the first

433
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,250
column had to be short so we knew that

434
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,950
it was in Java Neto and again computers

435
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:45,100
are quick and we just tried different

436
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:48,789
vowels until the thing sorted into the

437
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,740
right order so finally this is the

438
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,408
complete mapping with all the

439
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:58,500
misspellings out of the way of letters

440
00:22:53,409 --> 00:23:02,020
to key words to decrypt the messages now

441
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,500
this might have sounded painful but it

442
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,980
was actually way more linear how I just

443
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,720
told you then what actually happened

444
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,210
this was the store I told your story of

445
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,340
how we figure out one thing and then the

446
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,679
next thing and then that led to another

447
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,379
thing and things like leads to thing and

448
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:26,289
now we have a key not how it happened

449
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:30,070
this took months some of the assumptions

450
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:33,520
were completely wrong and led to long

451
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,320
chases of red herrings sometimes we

452
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,240
would have the right assumption but no

453
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,899
way to confirm it so no way to know if

454
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:47,919
we should invest time figuring that out

455
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:51,100
sometimes my code had bugs and sometimes

456
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,770
you would just come to the conclusion in

457
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,049
three different ways at the same time

458
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,610
and that's how you knew it was right but

459
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,408
also I'm not presenting you three

460
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:03,250
different explanations for each things

461
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:06,789
because that would be boring but yes

462
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,650
these took months and by the way just

463
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,610
one month before we decrypted it

464
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:17,870
we got scooped

465
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:21,870
by German amateur cryptographer arming

466
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:24,689
Kraus in April 2013

467
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,840
we had the final decryptions

468
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:30,620
a couple months after that however

469
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,330
something that he did not do was

470
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,229
published the whole decryptions

471
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,699
and we suspect that there was a one of

472
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,100
the reasons he did not do that right

473
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,950
away is that he did not speak Italian

474
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:52,139
because the hard work wasn't done after

475
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:54,360
decrypting the messages so was not only

476
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,150
a matter of knowing Italian that was

477
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,399
also a matter of transcribing letters

478
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,550
into the computer so sometimes it was

479
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,240
easy sometimes it was not it took a lot

480
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:09,540
of nights and hours - for us to figure

481
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,760
out all the papers and then once we

482
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,800
enter capture done we needed to add

483
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,710
spaces it can be easy it can be not easy

484
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:23,220
especially when their notes comes from

485
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,380
the previous century and there are name

486
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,890
of villages that you don't know or maybe

487
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,290
do not exist anymore or you know words

488
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:34,620
changes over time so different spellings

489
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,040
and he made some grammatical errors as

490
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,889
well

491
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,490
so they were not easy to read once we

492
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:45,930
put all the spaces in we need to figure

493
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:49,580
out a way to sort these codes every

494
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:53,490
snippet started with random letters and

495
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:56,250
not a numbers between Roman letters and

496
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:01,140
then a day so these particular snippets

497
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:03,810
translates in number 82 day 27 again

498
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,180
this is now all easy but it was not

499
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:13,710
reading it for the first time after 70

500
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:17,520
years so those new parts are not just

501
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:21,450
about word by word they were are also

502
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,410
about how to synchronize with the Allies

503
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:29,170
in order to be able to communicate

504
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:33,050
so he tries to different channels

505
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,390
different parts and in order to be able

506
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,280
to receive and send communications and

507
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,330
yes oh really

508
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:47,510
quartz not frequencies or knobs there

509
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:50,480
are actual stones there after reading

510
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:54,140
all of them we put them on a map this is

511
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,770
a northern Italy that area is Eastern

512
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:01,790
Italy the borders now are different once

513
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:04,310
we had all these Peninsula here what's

514
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:10,639
called Italy as well and the border was

515
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:14,210
running across there so we mapped all of

516
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:19,400
them they cover a pretty big area it's

517
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:20,990
around 5,600 square miles and the

518
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,070
longest line you can trace from one

519
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,650
point to another is around 170 miles it

520
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,169
will take now three hours three hours

521
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,130
and a half by car to cover all that Road

522
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:37,340
so you can imagine on the war by bike

523
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:40,460
was not an easy job taking a closer look

524
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:43,490
there were a lot of places some of them

525
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,130
are not in this slide I wasn't able to

526
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,560
trace all the villages down sometimes

527
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,300
you mentioned this family's farm and

528
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,860
obviously I don't know what the farm in

529
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:58,700
Avoyelles yeah after putting the

530
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,949
monomyth we create a timeline we know

531
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:06,980
these are the notes from the last month

532
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:11,990
of world were ended officially April 25

533
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:14,930
in 1945 in Italy and these are all the

534
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:20,300
notes that we have maybe there were some

535
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:23,360
more but we again we don't know we can

536
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,919
see how he started can be sending

537
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,530
sending a lot more communication during

538
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,770
the last days of the reparation of

539
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,760
northern Italy but maybe maybe lost more

540
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,760
in the first week of April

541
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,730
so it was obvious how this project would

542
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:44,260
turn out to be personal for us

543
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:47,150
my my family is from that area we

544
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,360
suffered a lot from the Second World War

545
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:53,600
then all northern Italy actually took a

546
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,969
really harsh hit during world war ii so

547
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,050
we we went through all the messages and

548
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:02,630
really fell down before it was worth

549
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,850
dividing them in three different topics

550
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:12,470
the first one is the logistics targets

551
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:15,129
and damage reports so he here it was at

552
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,840
the beginning of the month he was

553
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:21,310
helping the Allies for

554
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:26,139
air strikes he was telling them where to

555
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:30,950
hit the Nazis were their ammunition for

556
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:38,330
aircraft were that they were not enough

557
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:43,520
they were using them a lot then later on

558
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:47,030
he the Allies were approaching from east

559
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:51,100
and the Germans were starting to retreat

560
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:55,010
right so he sent his note about that

561
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:00,010
particular Road on the coast that was

562
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:02,150
bringing to the eastern docks of Italy

563
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,360
he'd been particularly mentioned

564
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:10,670
minefields here and states of roads and

565
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:13,449
bridges so the Germans left behind some

566
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:18,010
minefields for the earliest to stop in

567
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,010
hopefully he saved a couple of lives

568
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,070
maybe more yeah

569
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:28,580
so yeah then the German starts to

570
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:31,669
retreat north because they had because

571
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,790
the Yugoslavia yes we go saw you could

572
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:37,910
Slavic people coming from the east

573
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:40,700
Allies British people coming from the

574
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,610
from the West so so Germans started

575
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,970
going north and and so he was reporting

576
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,399
the state of roads and

577
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,580
passages up in the mountains in this

578
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,310
particular passage she claims that in

579
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:59,189
order to block crossing up a river he

580
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,190
needed to destroy both foot bridges

581
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:07,690
after doing a lot of logistics he also

582
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,810
talked about people moods and how the

583
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,700
city was actually failing on well you

584
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,860
know an Army is occupying your city it's

585
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,040
not always easy and people can create

586
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:25,209
problems so also useful information

587
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:28,300
right in this particular snippet he is

588
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:32,050
talking about police shooting people

589
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:35,230
young people in prisons they didn't the

590
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:38,230
Nazis actually set up an extraordinary

591
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,930
court to condemn people to death before

592
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,350
the Allies actually came into the

593
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,830
territory and the they did that pretty

594
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,379
quickly

595
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,870
I wouldn't be here if I if the Allies

596
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,420
hadn't really liberated them my

597
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,899
grandfather was one of those young guy

598
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:59,200
condemned to death so I'm feeling glad

599
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,890
this communication were actually being

600
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,590
sent also never the party really the

601
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,510
Patriots are buzzing so there are people

602
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:18,100
that want to do something that want to

603
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:20,500
take actions afterwards so the Allies

604
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,659
can kick coming in the Germans do not

605
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,320
know where to go

606
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:30,340
some German troops in this particular

607
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,460
snippet were five thousand people from

608
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,889
the opposite Army didn't know where to

609
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,130
go they were pushed back from Yugoslavia

610
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:42,190
and they they didn't know if they wanted

611
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:44,800
to go back to Germany's camps or doing

612
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,500
being a deserters up in Italian

613
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,980
mountains both auctions were risky at

614
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,400
the time because we had

615
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,520
resistance in the mountains from the

616
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,200
departs the part of the partisans and

617
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:09,210
you know going back to your camps cannot

618
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:11,580
always be safe right he he also

619
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:15,150
describes the parties in the resistance

620
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,860
taking action those groups were not

621
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:22,500
always organized they didn't actually

622
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,870
respond to an organization in big cities

623
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,620
especially in Milan they had some sort

624
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:31,500
of hierarchy and someone that was sunny

625
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:35,429
hoarders but in the mountains no one

626
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:38,520
cared they did a lot of career warfare

627
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:41,930
and they tried in vain taking some

628
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,210
cities but they always failed until the

629
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:57,420
the the army arrived the Allies army

630
00:33:45,210 --> 00:34:00,960
arrived so after a while Germans start

631
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:05,120
to be desperate and they start taking

632
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:11,460
armed arms from the Italian Army they

633
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:15,350
they start to attack the finance guard

634
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:19,290
and monisha taking their their arms and

635
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:22,918
the the city life is obviously disrupted

636
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:25,230
it was adopted this is only this is all

637
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:30,080
short also sorry this is also the only

638
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:32,850
note were Marcy sends a personal line

639
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,980
stating dr.rob remember my family

640
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,520
regards

641
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:41,100
Mario we do not know who Mario was it

642
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,389
might be another name he was using under

643
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,650
bohemian lines

644
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:49,699
Marcy Mario can make sense but it can

645
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,740
also be a hidden message in there and

646
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,259
this is the only time he writes

647
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:58,669
something personal in

648
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:04,400
in these in 75 pages we find that

649
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:07,130
interesting as well and finally the

650
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,380
advance of the other is an elaboration

651
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,890
of Trista

652
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:16,400
so Trust is the easternmost city in

653
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:20,060
Italy and it's just right on the border

654
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,720
and he has a particular history for the

655
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,350
world war two so let's start at the

656
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,490
beginning

657
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:31,540
the the Allies arrived interest and

658
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:37,549
people were celebrating they were

659
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:45,710
showing showing show enjoying I guess

660
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:47,480
yes and the they sent the national

661
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,490
liberation committee that was the

662
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,230
political umbrella of the partisan

663
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:59,029
resistance to send notice to Venice and

664
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:03,580
asked to support the support from the

665
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:07,430
royal government the Germany the Germans

666
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,110
being refused to actually gave in but

667
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:13,190
then the English arrived and they

668
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:16,970
surrendered on the same day the same

669
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,670
note here still he also mentions the

670
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:24,080
authorities and this is crucial because

671
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:28,070
they started taking up with occupancies

672
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,590
of Trieste hanging hanging on posters in

673
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:34,190
their own language not in Italian and

674
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,320
imposing their own time zone and that

675
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,180
was an Italian city so they were

676
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:44,300
basically occupying the city soon after

677
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:46,730
the the Germans were kicked out of it he

678
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:51,740
sends another note from the same day

679
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:54,980
just some like later on saying that the

680
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,290
the situation is fine tragic so in the

681
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:02,090
same day he goes from hey we are

682
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:06,009
celebrating a lot and people do many

683
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:07,630
many many firsts a lot of

684
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,450
okay didn't demonstrate a lot of

685
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:12,490
positive feelings and they're separating

686
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:18,930
but then this situation is becoming

687
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:18,930
strategy it was really peak coupe

688
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:26,470
so there were songs in a city where

689
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:29,529
bread and food are missing the people

690
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,750
loved just the Italian people of trust

691
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,600
are waiting for the support of other

692
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:37,000
Italian cities they were the last

693
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,150
Italian city to be liberated from the

694
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,460
Nazis the English authorities that were

695
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,170
third that helped them liberate the city

696
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,940
from the Nazis do not know what to do

697
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:50,859
because it was a political mess right

698
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,930
also it's worth remembering our the

699
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:59,080
borders were not like T's at the time

700
00:37:52,930 --> 00:38:01,509
all this area here was Italy so you got

701
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:08,020
a you got a lot of people took the city

702
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:14,170
and then they kept going north this is

703
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:17,170
the last of none of our notes as I said

704
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:19,420
the borders were not like that but they

705
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:25,619
were they were probably going your

706
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:28,030
houdina so here he is complaining about

707
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,440
you guys having people taking Italian

708
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:36,070
people and deporting them to Bosnia he's

709
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:40,570
also complaining that they are seizing

710
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:45,700
every house for food and clothes and the

711
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:48,130
bishop is a declared enemy of the oven

712
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:54,689
public public enemy and he flees the

713
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:57,490
city and goes back to Rome so he also

714
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:02,740
clearly communicate the intentions of

715
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:06,549
you Davi people to keep going until the

716
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:10,600
rivercourt element that I think is in

717
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,670
this area it was a really tough period

718
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:17,220
for Italy especially for Chester the

719
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:19,950
Second World War was officially over and

720
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:24,290
they were still fighting another

721
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:28,230
war and that's not always mentioned in

722
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:30,750
in the history we usually study so this

723
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:36,480
was the last note from Antonio artsy

724
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:40,260
that we have now we he died in 2007 so

725
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,340
he never so his notes decrypted in in

726
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:47,850
time and color sorry sorry for that this

727
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:52,200
has been really important in my mine

728
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:54,569
life and understanding of my family we

729
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:59,850
also are really glad to have these notes

730
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:02,580
we think we have them because he was

731
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:04,710
usually destroying them every month but

732
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,130
then he saw that with the world being

733
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:14,400
almost over and decided to captain to

734
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:17,280
keep done so we might have not been had

735
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,350
been able to get them if we decided to

736
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,350
stick to the protocol and destroy done

737
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,780
[Applause]

738
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,529

00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,730

[Music]

741
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:47,970
I think we have some time for questions

742
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,970
we are not historians so take it easy

743
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,210
yeah please I think I'm holding the

744
00:40:51,730 --> 00:41:01,090
questions microphone am i no okay cool

745
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:04,690
so I can't see anything so someone will

746
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:07,780
have to handle questions hi I'm at the

747
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,160
microphone hello um so now that now that

748
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,310
you've accomplished this great goal are

749
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,819
there other letters and encrypted

750
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:24,520
Italian that you're now working on

751
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:26,890
there's none I'm aware of okay the

752
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,850
website where these were found also had

753
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:34,710
a number of other and challenges in the

754
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:37,990
undeciphered section but some are fairly

755
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:43,210
unreasonable like the Aris a factoring

756
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:45,430
challenge with keys of size 4096 thank

757
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,280
you

758
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:52,509
and others are the very famous and well

759
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:56,770
studied your ciphertext and along those

760
00:41:52,510 --> 00:42:00,610
lines this was a what one of the least

761
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:02,560
known on on that side so thanks thanks

762
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,590
for a terrific talk and an interesting

763
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,150
story behind it so I have a question you

764
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:13,570
say you're not historians although I

765
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:16,350
think you are now what is what so

766
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,370
obviously this is seems historically

767
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,890
significant and historically interesting

768
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:23,350
what's what's being done with the the

769
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:26,259
results of these plain texts that you've

770
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,799
discovered there are public on the

771
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,300
Internet

772
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,370
there's a website about them I we

773
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,680
thought about printing them in a book

774
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:41,189
with some maps and some historical

775
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:44,348
context but we never action on it so

776
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:46,649
yet to be clear these were decrypted by

777
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:50,799
other people and they have been since

778
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:52,719
passed to Italian people that did the

779
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:55,749
code them and put them on the Internet

780
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,910
in the five years since we finished the

781
00:42:55,749 --> 00:43:00,759
crypt in them this is just the first

782
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:05,169
time we published our process to get to

783
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:05,619
them and our version of them thank you

784
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:08,140
again

785
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:09,579
have you made any presumably these

786
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,900
messages were being sent to someone in a

787
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:12,999
government position and they were being

788
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:20,289
archived somewhere have you ever tried

789
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:22,598
to compare the two sides I tried I I

790
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:24,339
tried to ask a bunch of questions to

791
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:28,179
different people that might know the

792
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:30,759
answer but it's hard to find these

793
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:36,099
things online especially wonder from the

794
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:38,829
government the British National Archives

795
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,719
do have now the SA training manuals but

796
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:45,159
at the time it was an extremely

797
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:47,709
secretive agency we I don't have reason

798
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:49,689
to believe they survived the decryptions

799
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:53,459
for the other side and if they did we

800
00:43:49,689 --> 00:43:53,459
didn't find them thank you

801
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:14,199
okay thank you very much

802
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:14,199
