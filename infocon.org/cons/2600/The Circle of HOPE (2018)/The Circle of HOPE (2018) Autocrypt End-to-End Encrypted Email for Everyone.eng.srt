1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,350
I'm Daniel Cahn Gilmore I am a free

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,679
software developer I am I work for the

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,049
ACLU as a technologist interest in civil

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,000
rights and civil liberties I work on

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,420
internet protocols at the ITF and I work

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,939
at within the Debian project and I'm

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,779
interested in figuring out how we get

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,580
more secure more protective

9
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:29,189
communications by default and one of the

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,959
it's made me sad is the state of

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,278
encrypted email and so that's why I'm

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,350
working on this autocrat project with a

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,260
bunch of other people and I wanted to

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,120
explain to you what we're up to give you

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,620
a sense about what's what's going on

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,449
there and and why we're doing this I

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,839
should also note that there's going to

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,129
be a auto equipped workshop where you

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,829
can actually try to get Auto Crypt

20
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,610
installed which will be at 15 o'clock in

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,050
Paris so 3 p.m. in Paris so if you want

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,969
to this is this talk is going to be a

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,339
description of like the goals and the

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,979
structure of the project and hopefully

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,159
questions and answers I'm happy to have

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,869
this be interactive we have a mic line

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,220
here so if you have a question to ask

28
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,840
you can either wave your hand and they

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,039
don't have to repeat it for you or you

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,210
could just go to the mic and then I

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,420
won't have to repeat it but I'm happy to

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,699
do it either way and so I will there's

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,350
this there space for Q&A at the end here

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,900
but I'm also happy to take questions if

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,729
I'm not making sense or you know if you

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,860
strenuously object to something or you

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,759
just want to share an observation I'd be

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,920
happy to have it so is everyone awake

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,979
it's 10 o'clock on Sunday raise your

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:45,380
hand if you're not awake oh that's not

41
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:51,140
good okay all right so otto crypt is

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:54,479
encrypted email for everyone so

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,840
traditional emails like a postcard we

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,640
can do encrypted email but just to get a

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,020
sense of who here is in the room I'm

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,979
sorry I'm gonna keep squinting and going

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,030
like this because these lights are

48
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,539
blinding me

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:11,009
but who here has used who here has set

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,599
up encrypted email ever Wow all right we

51
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,470
have a fairly high number of hands

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,530
raised

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,280
here has actually used the encrypted

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,560
email that they set up okay so it's a

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,580
little bit less and who here used it in

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:32,250
the last month fewer hands again and who

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,540
here used it yesterday yeah okay so so

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,700
there's a bunch of nerds at this

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,940
conference I'm one of them

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,769
yeah who shot up to my nerds so

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,090
encrypted emails really actually only

62
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,740
usable by the persistent nerds among us

63
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,690
and one of the reasons that we don't use

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,040
it every day there were I think two

65
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,670
hands raised is because nobody else can

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,010
use it

67
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,049
so the only people we can talk to where

68
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,239
they're encrypted email as other nerds

69
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,090
who use encrypted email so my goal one

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,740
of the goals for me for Auto crypt was

71
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,990
people come to me in my capacity at the

72
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,770
ACLU or just as an activist in New York

73
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,970
City and they asked me hey I'm suddenly

74
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,530
realizing that all this information

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,500
security stuff you were talking about

76
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,090
isn't just your freakish paranoia can

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,040
you help me out can you help me get set

78
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,850
up I want to protect my email first and

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
I say okay well who here's helped

80
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,130
somebody set up encrypted email by the

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,200
way okay so a few people here I think

82
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,950
probably know the pain of this the pain

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,940
is that you say to them well sure when

84
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,709
do you have a free day and these folks

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,209
are busy people right they're activists

86
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,950
they're doing other stuff maybe they've

87
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,060
got a company that they're running maybe

88
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,548
they just want to be able to talk to

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,620
their partner maybe they're concerned

90
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,930
about their employer but they're busy

91
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,340
people and they don't have a day so like

92
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,930
okay how about this how about do we do

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,470
the short version when do you have four

94
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,120
hours free and of course nobody really

95
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,380
has four hours free anyway and what they

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
just want to do is get on with the work

97
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,920
that they're doing and so auto crip says

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,950
what if we made it easy for those folks

99
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,690
what if somebody came to you and said

100
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,988
how do I do how do I protect my email

101
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,079
and you said to them install any auto

102
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,630
crypt enabled any auto crypt capable

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,918
mail program and I'll give you a list of

104
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,130
them and turn it on

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,169
that was the training

106
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,060
and then when you go to send an email

107
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,280
you're gonna get a check box that says

108
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,840
encrypt this message if it's possible to

109
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,869
encrypt if it's not you won't get the

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,150
check box that's the training so not for

111
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,220
hours no explanation of number theory

112
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,549
you know which is sad because I like

113
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,170
number theory but but the goal is to get

114
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,510
this to be usable for actually everybody

115
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,180
and that should hopefully help out

116
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:53,010
trainers as well so the goals for

117
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,870
autocrat to our usability simplicity and

118
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,020
security right so we want all of those

119
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,300
things together the sad part about these

120
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,909
goals is that sometimes it's hard to get

121
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,040
all of them at once and we've always

122
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,750
wanted all of these goals I think I'm

123
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,460
assuming that nobody here who's worked

124
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,900
on encrypted email for the last thirty

125
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,370
years or so that we've had encrypted

126
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,349
email available hasn't wanted to not

127
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,910
have any of these goals we've just

128
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:22,120
failed for thirty years to provide those

129
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,500
goals all together and the one of the

130
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,240
reasons I think that we failed is we've

131
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,580
traditionally gone ahead and said okay

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,040
Security's that the ultimate concern

133
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,390
here and you know if usability and

134
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,510
simplicity get in the way

135
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,580
well sorry those are out the window and

136
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,550
the result of course is that we have 30

137
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,979
years of clear text email because nobody

138
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,570
can actually use it regularly which

139
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,240
means that if nobody else is using it

140
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,909
you can't use it either so I'm sorry my

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,970
slides were they're actually pretty cool

142
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,530
and like flashy and stuff and it's

143
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,790
they're not being all flashy right now

144
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,469
and I kind of want to make them flashy

145
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,780
so you can see all the fun animations

146
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,010
and things that I've put in so if you'll

147
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:05,469
excuse me for one second here I'm just

148
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:08,789
going to try to get that back apologies

149
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,790
for the for the garbage here

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:32,550
there we go okay so let's see whether

151
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:36,240
this works now okay yeah there we go

152
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,530
okay so um and one things about Auto

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,419
craft is that we're basically turning a

154
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,590
bunch of assumptions upside down which

155
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,240
is why I wanted to show you the nice

156
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,190
loopy graphics to reinforce the idea

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,220
that the assumptions that you might have

158
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,780
had before about the way encrypted email

159
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,130
works and about the threat model and all

160
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,260
that we're gonna we're gonna break some

161
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,210
of those assumptions and that that's

162
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,030
kind of sad it makes me sad because I

163
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,198
liked those assumptions but I'm not

164
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,929
actually that worried about it because

165
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,370
we haven't been meeting any of our goals

166
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,060
for the last thirty years so it's kind

167
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,949
of time to do something new so right so

168
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,100
these are our goals

169
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,570
what is Auto crip gonna be to look at

170
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,370
this right Auto crip is it's an

171
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,320
interoperable standard right it's not an

172
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,330
app it's not there's not like oh just go

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,860
install Auto crypt our goal is we don't

174
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,690
you we don't want you to have to decide

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,190
to trust any one particular program

176
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,669
right we should you shouldn't have to

177
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,560
trust Facebook to be your like mail

178
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,030
delivery and give you software to run on

179
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,470
your device and to protect you from

180
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,559
Facebook that's all kind of confusing we

181
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,060
want interoperable standard we wanted to

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,340
be able to work in the same federated

183
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,870
environments that it works with email we

184
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,650
want the user experience to be as simple

185
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,289
as possible

186
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,239
right so Auto crypt is a standard and

187
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,159
you can say this app is Auto crypt

188
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,690
enable this email program this mail user

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,699
agent I might use all those words

190
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,910
interchangeably this is a nerd audience

191
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,530
so I hope mail user agent isn't too

192
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,979
opaque or scary it just means an email

193
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,330
app so yeah so Auto crypt is like a

194
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:09,449
feature that an email app could build in

195
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,710
so so so why are we doing this why are

196
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,360
we doing it this way why are we making

197
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,948
this interoperable thing well we want to

198
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,419
get people on board right we want to get

199
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,250
users on board but we also want to get

200
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,810
developers on board we don't want a

201
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,360
developer to feel like oh I'm competing

202
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,150
with Auto Crips no no we want you like

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,740
come on bring-bring your app to this and

204
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,270
it will work with all the other auto

205
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,430
Crypt enabled apps we want that kind of

206
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,740
Federation we want more encrypted

207
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,180
messages on the mail servers today

208
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,190
there's just too much clear text

209
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,870
floating around if if we can make it

210
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,910
easy for people to send encrypted email

211
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,860
then they will if we can make it so that

212
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,689
they don't get frustrated it will and

213
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,850
you can only send someone encrypted

214
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,350
email when they're using encrypted email

215
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,730
when they have the capability so I

216
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,450
should warn you we're not going to

217
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,010
encrypt all the messages because we care

218
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,480
about user experience and it turns out

219
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,939
that in some cases which are kind of a

220
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,460
pain we're not gonna do encrypted

221
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,780
messages but that's okay we're gonna

222
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,380
make it possible to send encrypted

223
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:08,910
messages which it currently isn't today

224
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:12,300
so in detail the auto clip goals are it

225
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,709
should work with any email account that

226
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,319
means you should not have to give up

227
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,020
your name in order to use it like your

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,980
current handle on in email you shouldn't

229
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,710
have to give that up you shouldn't to

230
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,630
switch to be so and so at rise up or so

231
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,680
and so it to denote or you should don't

232
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,180
don't change it it should work with any

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,329
email provider the provider doesn't have

234
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,829
to do anything we want to avoid the

235
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,040
situations where people end up with

236
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,080
unreadable mail right unexpectedly

237
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,569
unreadable mail right we want mail in

238
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,520
general to be unreadable by the folks

239
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,720
who shouldn't be reading the mail but we

240
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,430
want to make it so that when you're

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,690
surprised that you get an unreadable

242
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,900
mail we want to minimize those

243
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,520
situations so in terms of attrition for

244
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,340
people like when everyone who put their

245
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,870
hand down who had maybe use mail in the

246
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,730
last month but hadn't used encrypted

247
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,210
mail yesterday when everybody put their

248
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,440
hand down one of the reasons why people

249
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,210
sort of fall off of using encrypted

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,920
email is because they're like oh man I

251
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,750
just got this encrypted message but like

252
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,189
I'm traveling I don't have my key or

253
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,040
this is such a pain because it didn't

254
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,840
work or somebody some cryptid to my old

255
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,520
key or there's like a whole series of

256
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,200
paper cuts people have and our goal is

257
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,579
to minimize those paper cuts so that

258
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,710
people don't just turn the whole thing

259
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,480
off and we've been pretty aggressive

260
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,480
about saying what can we do to make sure

261
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,770
that people don't turn it off we don't

262
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,370
think the users need to know the term

263
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,079
key

264
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,490
I think the instant messenger situation

265
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,020
has made it pretty clear over the last

266
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,060
several years that it's possible to have

267
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,100
end-to-end encrypted messaging systems

268
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,810
of some sort where the users are not

269
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,330
confronted with key management choices

270
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,400
we can make good opinionated decisions

271
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,440
on behalf of the user

272
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,370
we're not going to stop any user

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,470
who wants to manage their keys

274
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,360
themselves but for Auto Crips purposes

275
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,690
the user shouldn't actually see anything

276
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,090
about the key and we wanted to just work

277
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,690
across a wide variety of people right if

278
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,420
I happen to be using email program X and

279
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,430
you're using email program Y I want to

280
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,699
be able to just send you encrypted mail

281
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,020
when I can and crucially and this is a

282
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,090
major pain point if we could forget

283
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,650
about this last bullet point up here the

284
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,780
life of the auto care project would be

285
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,189
much easier but it needs to work an

286
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,470
environment where people access their

287
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,390
email from multiple devices

288
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,050
who here access that access is their

289
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:29,330
email from only one device yeah okay who

290
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,560
here access their email from only two

291
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:36,280
devices right and who here accesses

292
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,290
their email from three or more devices

293
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,209
right so we're trying to deal with that

294
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,520
reality that's the situation we want to

295
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,650
make sure that that works too if you all

296
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,360
weren't doing that which is your problem

297
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,010
if you weren't doing that then my job

298
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,500
would be a lot easier but it's not so

299
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,319
we're working with the world as it is

300
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,240
okay so what's the threat model here the

301
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,580
traditional email threat model is

302
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,680
against extremely powerful adversaries

303
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,190
right we want to protect against you

304
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,770
know a global active attacker who can do

305
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,210
arbitrary things to your data can muck

306
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,510
around with your message stored can

307
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,670
Forge stuff can you know maybe send

308
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,430
arbitrary protocol elements that's

309
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,260
trouble so for Auto clip we said well

310
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,109
you know what maybe we can back off of

311
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,400
that threat model at first and we're

312
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,890
just gonna make sure that everyone gets

313
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,079
protection against passive adversaries

314
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,180
right a passive adversary is somebody

315
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,580
who can read your mailbox can read your

316
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,189
mail in transit but they're not going to

317
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,510
inject arbitrary stuff so to start with

318
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,180
we said let's give ourselves a small

319
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,680
size scope what can we do to take this

320
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:45,079
small thing and and actually make it

321
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,180
usable for a broad population now I

322
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,310
acknowledge that that means that an

323
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,219
active adversary can probably break auto

324
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,109
crypt but the current situation where we

325
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,480
protect against an active adversary with

326
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,880
encrypted email is broken anyway because

327
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,150
nobody uses it so you don't even need to

328
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,200
be an

329
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,949
active adversary because it's all

330
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,930
cleared XML anyway right so for now the

331
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,370
first version of Auto crypt the thing to

332
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,199
try to get more mail user agents on

333
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,330
board is just protection against the

334
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,110
passive adversary and we have plans for

335
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,610
the future

336
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,710
to be able to detect two active

337
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,900
adversaries so to detect when things

338
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,550
have gone wrong but those plans are not

339
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,709
fully ironed out we just want to get a

340
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,870
broad-base protection against passive

341
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,990
adversaries first so that we can have

342
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,380
that level of protection for email and

343
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,740
the flip side of that is the underlying

344
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,080
theory behind Auto crypt like why does

345
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,520
why do we pick this threat model we

346
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,290
picked it on the basis of a theory

347
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,240
called opportunistic security which is

348
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,150
increasing in the protocol design

349
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,800
community that says you know for years

350
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,390
we've been going about this a little bit

351
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,620
backwards for years we've said look

352
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,530
either you've got a hundred percent

353
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,380
security or you've got you might as well

354
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,610
just like you know take your clothes off

355
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,800
and walk down the middle of street naked

356
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,060
because it's it's not it's not true

357
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,349
security we don't we want to give people

358
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,109
a false sense of security

359
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,660
opportunistic security says hey let's

360
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,860
just raise the floor right we know how

361
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,750
to raise the ceiling we've been raising

362
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,010
the ceiling for a while now let's just

363
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,920
raise the floor let's make it so that

364
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,750
there's a there's a easy baseline to

365
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,819
defend you against weaker attackers and

366
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,970
get that more widely distributed as a

367
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,800
baseline let's get what we can where we

368
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,870
can and keep trying to push it forward

369
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,120
it's not very satisfying for those of us

370
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,550
who were raised on this Mott on this

371
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,680
idea of like let's get 100% absolute

372
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,890
security but we've seen that that hasn't

373
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,410
actually worked better than clear text

374
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,060
the other version of the autocrat model

375
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,230
motto right we sort of joke around with

376
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,849
in the autocrat project about what's our

377
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,060
motto one of them is ads better than

378
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,690
clear text the other one is it's it's

379
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,150
probably better than not doing it which

380
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,280
you know just trying to set the stage

381
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,689
here right but but it should be easy

382
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,699
right we if as long as we're not getting

383
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,130
in people's way and it's better than not

384
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,750
doing it then that's a huge win over the

385
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,790
existing infrastructure because we're

386
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,810
aiming for this wide adoption right and

387
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,910
we're aiming to make sure that users

388
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,750
don't get frustrated so that's that's

389
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,860
where we're coming from

390
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,570
so I want to show you some some ideas

391
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,160
about what the configuration looks like

392
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,160
for

393
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:20,589
for an autocrat to mail user agent this

394
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:23,769
is the configuration so yeah thank you

395
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,329
thank you so I don't know if you're you

396
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,589
if you do use encrypted email and you

397
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:28,359
look at your encrypted email

398
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,480
configuration but this is our goal this

399
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,759
is what we want mail user agents email

400
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,970
apps that implement Auto Crips to have

401
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,040
we want you to just say enable it that

402
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,980
should be the only configuration most

403
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,319
users ever need to see and if you click

404
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,240
that button then the next time that

405
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,110
you're writing an email to someone you

406
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,149
might see this again that's the user

407
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,550
interface change right there's a oh

408
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:57,639
there's an encrypted message checkbox

409
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,829
you can ah it should be checked by

410
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,959
default I hear someone say right so

411
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,939
we've had quite a bit of discussion

412
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,268
about that and I love the idea of it

413
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:09,910
being checked by default but some of

414
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,610
y'all people check your mail on multiple

415
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,579
devices from multiple apps I heard I

416
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,439
won't name any names but if you do

417
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,839
chances are you're not going to get Auto

418
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:23,319
clip turned on on all of your devices at

419
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,009
once and the result of that if it's

420
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,800
checked by default is that you're gonna

421
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,420
send mail to someone and they're not

422
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,389
going to be at their device that's Auto

423
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,899
crypt enabled and they're gonna be like

424
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,819
ah dude you know I'm at work right now

425
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,759
can you please resend it in the clear

426
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:45,250
and then you're gonna get in nerd to the

427
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,720
idea that one of the easy ways for

428
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,240
something like yeah I'm just gonna

429
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,410
resend stuff in the clear and the person

430
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,819
who receives that message that's

431
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,439
encrypted when they didn't want it to be

432
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:56,079
encrypted when it was just by default

433
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,099
encrypted is man this auto clip thing is

434
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,739
a pain in my ass

435
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,420
because basically half the messages that

436
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,589
I get now are encrypted and I have to

437
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,168
write them back and there's this an

438
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,130
extra round trip and I don't want to I

439
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,089
don't want to keep doing that so you

440
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,610
know what I'm just gonna turn Auto

441
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:12,668
clipped off so that's why it's not

442
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:15,099
encrypted by default it gives you the

443
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,630
opportunity to encrypt as long as you've

444
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,708
received an email from someone else who

445
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,329
uses auto crypt

446
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,760
but we're not going to turn it on by

447
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,619
default except for some unusual

448
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,569
circumstances and I can explain what

449
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,438
some of those unusual sir

450
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,269
senses are and again that makes me sad I

451
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,130
was looking at how can we make it turned

452
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:33,539
on by default because I was really

453
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,549
excited about that but I've been pretty

454
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,408
convinced that that will be one of the

455
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,889
things that gives people surprising

456
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,179
unexpected unreadable mail now if I'm

457
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:44,990
sending you mail and I know you've got

458
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:47,340
multiple devices and I want to encrypt

459
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,860
to you because this is a particularly

460
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,139
sensitive message I can go ahead and

461
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,330
encrypt anyway and if I'm doing that

462
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,469
it's a conscious choice and that means

463
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,029
that when someone writes me back and

464
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,169
says I can't get it right now others be

465
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,450
like that's cool they'll get it when

466
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,399
they get to one of their encrypted apps

467
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,500
right but they're not going to be I'm

468
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,959
not gonna be you know accidentally

469
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,669
sending them stuff that they don't like

470
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,690
when you're reading mail if you get an

471
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:13,259
encrypted message it would look

472
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,429
something like this and again for those

473
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,350
of us who are used to the traditional

474
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,940
model of like oh yeah let me let's let's

475
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,039
make sure that we can check fingerprints

476
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,929
here let's show the fingerprints let's

477
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,070
do some complicated thing nope the

478
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,990
answer is just we're going to show you

479
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,149
that this thing wasn't was was protected

480
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,120
or we're not gonna show it to you and

481
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,739
you're gonna assume that it's clear text

482
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,449
if you want to get fancy about it maybe

483
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,429
at some point we'll put it we'll replace

484
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,929
that with this message was not encrypted

485
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,399
for the not encrypted messages the way

486
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,250
that Chrome and Firefox are not doing

487
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:42,719
for HTTP which was awesome we're not

488
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,549
there yet an email because we haven't

489
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,860
taken the steps that we need to

490
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:48,658
establish the baseline but that's about

491
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,570
it for the for the user interface there

492
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:53,970
now I should add that there's a couple

493
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,309
of other pieces of user interface that

494
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,559
we plan on having available for the

495
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,740
advanced user so do you guys want to see

496
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,629
the advanced user interface well I

497
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,190
actually get mixed messages someone in

498
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,600
this crowd says no I don't want to see

499
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,700
the advanced this is not you need to

500
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:16,820
leave hope I'm sorry wait and have I

501
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,820
missed it I've missed it sorry my

502
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:21,110
where's my advanced interface

503
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,890
it is too advanced I apologize all right

504
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,659
let me um so the advanced interface

505
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,370
which apparently I failed to put in my

506
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,370
slides because I was reformatting them

507
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:37,280
to three three four by three format for

508
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,919
the last hour the advanced interface is

509
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,990
a single check box and the single check

510
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,150
box says enable Auto crypt mutual mode

511
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,530
so that's confusing to someone who

512
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,310
doesn't know what's going on but above

513
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,440
that there'll be text that says if the

514
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,980
sender and all recipients of a message

515
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,360
have opted into Auto crip mutual mode

516
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,400
then the message then new messages will

517
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,840
be encrypted by default so that's where

518
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,000
we get back to the encryption by default

519
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,649
and in the first round of auto crypt

520
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,330
clients we're not going to make that

521
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,340
particularly visible to the end-user

522
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,020
there may be some Auto Care clients that

523
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,669
choose to check that checkbox by default

524
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,310
for their users but for something for a

525
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,570
mail user agent that's just helping a

526
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,770
user move along with the traditional

527
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,820
mail they're not going to check that by

528
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:25,010
default the reason we want that mutual

529
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,540
opt-in is we want to make sure that we

530
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,250
don't have again we don't have like

531
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,659
surprisingly unencrypted message a

532
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,870
surprisingly encrypted and unreadable

533
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,400
mail so that's it that's that's one

534
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,479
piece of the advanced interface the

535
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,370
other piece of the advanced interface

536
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,650
will be what happens when you decide you

537
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,540
want to make your mail client work with

538
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,560
your other mail client I'm going like

539
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,850
this because I'm pretending that they're

540
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,790
phones but maybe one of them is your

541
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,290
desktop or your laptop and to do that in

542
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,530
your mail user agent there'll be just a

543
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,920
button that says so you've already

544
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,230
enabled all decrypt on one client and

545
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,900
there will be a button that says add

546
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,300
another Auto crypt enabled app to this

547
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,820
account and you'll click that button and

548
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:08,030
there will be a a bunch of numbers and

549
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,010
it says go to your other account and to

550
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,710
go do their app and type in this series

551
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,970
of numbers into it like enable auto crip

552
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,580
and type in this series of numbers you

553
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,170
go to the other app and it'll present

554
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,490
you with that same set of options once

555
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,050
you've typed in that same set of numbers

556
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,220
then everything will work at the

557
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,899
background you don't have to know what's

558
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,090
going on and your settings and your

559
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,460
preferences and of whatever needs to be

560
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,860
there will be transferred by default all

561
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,060
this is done just I can go into under

562
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,990
the hood and a little bit you probably

563
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,370
want to know how it's work

564
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,840
into the hood but that's that that's it

565
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,010
like that really is the full scope of

566
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,699
what we expect the Auto Cup user

567
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:43,220
interface to be and nothing beyond that

568
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:48,110
so we have implementations which is

569
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,340
exciting we have enigmail the latest

570
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,020
version of enigmail has Auto crip

571
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,939
features in it it hasn't been pared down

572
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,550
to as simple as we would like it to be

573
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,020
in the auto crypt version but we are

574
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,500
working on that

575
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,120
k9 male the stable release has auto

576
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,150
creep capabilities built-in as long as

577
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,909
you have open keychain plug-in installed

578
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:10,220
and likewise the beta version has even

579
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,880
more user interface improvements Delta

580
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,700
chat is a novel mail user agent that

581
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,940
takes a telegram front-end and hooks it

582
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,970
into an email back end and it has Auto

583
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,040
crypt plugged in as well

584
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
there not much mail user agent which is

585
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,070
one that I work on I've got a

586
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,590
development branch that I'm trying to

587
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,809
get auto crypt compliant and we welcome

588
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,659
lots of other mail user agents we're in

589
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,010
discussions with several of them but if

590
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,950
you have a particular one that you're

591
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,650
interested in I'd love to talk with you

592
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,400
after the session here at hope in an

593
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,720
ongoing way we don't have anyone

594
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,130
currently working on a plugin for

595
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,059
Outlook I would really like to see that

596
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,280
but we but we don't have it yet it would

597
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:58,610
be super useful to have it built in to

598
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,250
Outlook it would increase the user base

599
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,100
indeed so anyway and same with mail dot

600
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,110
app right so I know that this is not

601
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,730
exactly the crowd to expect Microsoft

602
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,649
and Apple representatives in but if you

603
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,960
are or if you are friends or

604
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,710
acquaintances with any of them please if

605
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,700
you use one of these programs tell your

606
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,720
tell the folks who make your mail user

607
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,900
agent that you want Auto crypt

608
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,850
capability and we are an open group

609
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,800
we're happy to work with them with with

610
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:28,750
whoever shows up proprietary non

611
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,750
proprietary the goal is mass adoption

612
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,420
they only show up at hope if there's no

613
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,270
day being dropped it was the comment

614
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,620
from the audience that I suspect that

615
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,480
there are Microsoft and Apple people

616
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,129
here just because I know some Microsoft

617
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,049
and Apple people who are like

618
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,520
actually good nerds who just happen to

619
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,110
work for Microsoft and Apple so I don't

620
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,460
think that they're totally absent but I

621
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,000
don't know if they're either probably

622
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,710
not in this room so does anybody want to

623
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,730
understand like how the stuff works

624
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:01,940
under the hood okay I see some hands

625
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,220
raised so in my talk if I'm presenting

626
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,039
Auto crypts specifically to trainers to

627
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,570
an audience of people who are whose job

628
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
is to go out and improve digital

629
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:14,629
security I would typically stop my talk

630
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,870
where I did where we got to here because

631
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,970
what the user faces is what the trainer

632
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,649
is going to be working with right and so

633
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,200
I want to really emphasize that the core

634
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,600
the core impact for Auto crip is going

635
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,640
to be on trainers and on the people who

636
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,740
are trying to use encrypted mail right

637
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,090
so I'm happy to go under the hood in

638
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,159
this crowd because I think this crowd

639
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,780
tends to want to know and you hopefully

640
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,970
you'll pick apart some of the decisions

641
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,129
and the descriptions that I'll give but

642
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,530
I really want to emphasize that we want

643
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,900
to keep this user facing part basically

644
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,908
as it is because we think that is about

645
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,830
as much complexity as we can expect a

646
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,780
trainer to effectively impart to a group

647
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,280
of people particularly because the

648
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,899
people the trainer trains if they

649
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,970
actually want to use encrypted email

650
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,590
will themselves have to become a sub

651
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,970
trainer and go out and tell their other

652
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,918
contacts who didn't make it to the

653
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,440
training hey can you turn this stuff on

654
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,179
right so really we want these this kind

655
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,090
of adoption to be sort of virally

656
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,770
spreadable because it you know currently

657
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,600
you're not going to get somebody who you

658
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,700
just start the rudiments of number

659
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,309
theory to turn around and explain them

660
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,960
to their to their friend in order to get

661
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,260
encrypted mail set up fingerprint

662
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:27,230
verification it's just not happening so

663
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:30,799
under the hood okay so the answer is the

664
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,360
tech is really stupid it's it's not

665
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,710
fancy at all the messages that are

666
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,280
encrypted are encrypted using the open

667
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:40,850
PGP standard same as most encrypted mail

668
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,370
is probably within this crowd

669
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,559
it will interoperate with existing open

670
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,270
PGP communications so that's a nice

671
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,490
feature if your friend starts using auto

672
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,770
crypt and you're using traditional PGP

673
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,429
model you can continue using it and

674
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,340
you'll still be able to talk with them

675
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:58,350
the key

676
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,600
management arrangement is done with a

677
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,789
series of very opinionated decisions

678
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,100
that we expect all auto krypt capable

679
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:08,640
mail user agents to hold to because they

680
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,500
provide a smooth user experience so the

681
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,929
way that that works is the first email

682
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,159
that I send to you I've never sent you

683
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:16,289
mail before you've never sent me mail

684
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,700
before that email is going to be in the

685
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:23,190
clear so this is sad because mail in the

686
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,659
clear makes me sad but in the real world

687
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,120
actually that tends to happen a lot

688
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,130
anyway like who here has sent someone an

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,229
email that said hey dude can you send me

690
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:35,429
your your your PGP key sir I have yes

691
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,529
there's lots of you there's lots of

692
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,480
hands that went up there so in this case

693
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,919
when I send you an email I don't have to

694
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,020
say hey dude can you send me a PGP key

695
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,960
is just the every email that I send to

696
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,480
you embeds my public key in it and it

697
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,390
stuffs the public key in the in a header

698
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,460
field a really janky ridiculously large

699
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,510
header field in some cases but that's

700
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,760
okay

701
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,289
turns out there's even jankier more

702
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,879
ridiculously large headers being stuffed

703
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,779
in there by things like Microsoft

704
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,340
SharePoint defense or pro 3000 or

705
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,480
whatever it is there's all kinds of

706
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,129
garbage if you look at your email

707
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,140
headers and it turns out that stuffing a

708
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,620
public key up there is actually not a

709
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,059
big deal so it's just not public key in

710
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,389
the header of every message that I send

711
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,918
out and every time that I receive a

712
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,210
message from someone it checks to see

713
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,850
whether that headers there and if it is

714
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,760
it associates the email address assuming

715
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,139
a couple of syntactic checks pan out it

716
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,879
associates the key with the email

717
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,970
address that was sent so when you go to

718
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,549
send it's gonna look in its opinionated

719
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,710
key store and say does the person who

720
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,539
I'm sending to have an auto clip capable

721
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,640
key because of messages that I've

722
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,169
received from them in the past and if it

723
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,169
does then that checkbox that encrypt

724
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,210
checkbox will be enabled so again this

725
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,250
is sketchy right because of active

726
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:54,529
attacker can just modify that or strip

727
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:57,559
it out or replace it with something and

728
00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:01,380
we won't have a defense against that

729
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,370
however if an active attacker is doing

730
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,710
that kind of stuff they can also

731
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,110
intercept your message that says hey can

732
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,080
you send me your PGP key right

733
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,399
we're also not using key servers the

734
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,870
reason there's a bunch of reasons we're

735
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,140
not using key servers among them

736
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:18,989
reliability spam concerns GDP our

737
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,870
concerns but also particularly metadata

738
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,160
traces when you make a query to a key

739
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,719
server you're leaking to the key server

740
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,330
your intent to communicate with someone

741
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,580
and we think that mail user agents

742
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,030
shouldn't need to either have an HTTP

743
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,070
stack available or leak information upon

744
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,899
message composition so what we're really

745
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,250
aiming to do is put everything in the

746
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,840
channel that the mail user agent can

747
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,330
already use so again

748
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,909
keys and headers whoo fancy technology

749
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,649
right but the point is the actual part

750
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:49,500
of auto clip that matters here is this

751
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:53,460
opinionated key management view where we

752
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,470
expect the local mail user agent to make

753
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,540
very specific set of decisions during

754
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,980
message composition time on the basis of

755
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,879
information that it gathered from those

756
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,830
things so that we call that the auto

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,840
crypt recommendation if you're a mail

758
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,939
user agent developer you'd consult the

759
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,629
auto cut recommendation when a new

760
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,130
message compose window pops up the

761
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,230
recommendation basically says if you're

762
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,970
replying to an encrypted mail the

763
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,530
encrypt and you and your hat if if you

764
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,960
don't have keys for all the recipients

765
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,690
then encryption is disabled you're going

766
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,220
to send in a clear if you have keys for

767
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,690
all recipients and you're replying to an

768
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,210
encrypted mail the reply will be

769
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,710
encrypted if you have keys for all

770
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,080
recipients and you're not replying to an

771
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,570
encrypted mail and everybody is in

772
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,310
mutual mode which is also communicated

773
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,960
in that same header then the reply will

774
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,500
be encrypted then - then then the new

775
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,740
message will be encrypted by default and

776
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,470
if you're sending mail and everyone in

777
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,850
you have keys for everyone but you don't

778
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,290
have everyone in mutual mode and it's

779
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,929
not a reply then encryption will be

780
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,149
available but not on by default so again

781
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,870
a little bit sad but the goal is not to

782
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,330
get in the way

783
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,159
and it's a relatively simple rule for a

784
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,110
mail user agent - right to consult an

785
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,590
opinionated database that's built of all

786
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,110
of these pieces that are sent in the

787
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:13,320
headers between mail user agents so

788
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,340
that's that's all we need in order to do

789
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,649
the simple thing

790
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,779
so it makes me sad that we're coming up

791
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,100
with really stupid technology in 2018

792
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,710
because with the time to come up with

793
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,158
really stupid technology is in 2000

794
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,230
right but we didn't do it and we didn't

795
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,870
do it because we were focusing on some

796
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:37,010
extremely powerful threat actor and

797
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,320
thinking oh well what we're gonna build

798
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:41,480
something that's like rock-solid for for

799
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,480
all of the folks who are gonna like take

800
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,760
down the man right which hey I want to

801
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,200
take down the man - right I really

802
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,429
appreciate that goal but it turns out

803
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,220
that everybody who wants to take down

804
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:54,139
the man has people in their life who

805
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,490
don't want to take down the man or don't

806
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:58,370
have an opportunity to take down the man

807
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:01,519
or are vulnerable in some other way and

808
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,379
if we focus our threat model on the

809
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,600
folks who have the strongest security

810
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,220
threats possible the result is that

811
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,559
they're either alienated from their

812
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,690
community who that they have around them

813
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,980
because their community doesn't want to

814
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,940
participate in some sort of paranoia

815
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:20,000
game or we force them to spend all of

816
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,549
their time becoming an encryption

817
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,740
trainer for their community which

818
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,720
doesn't being an encryption trainer

819
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,950
doesn't take down the man right sending

820
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,830
encrypted mail doesn't take down the man

821
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,779
you get if you want to organize to

822
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,539
defeat an incumbent power structure

823
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:36,799
that's that's unjust you need to have to

824
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:39,710
spend your time thinking about and

825
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,090
organizing that so so our goal here is

826
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,679
to make it so that the people who are

827
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,570
organizers the people who are under

828
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,179
threat from powerful actors will be able

829
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,658
to to do this without having taking a

830
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:52,250
bunch of time away from their work I

831
00:31:49,659 --> 00:32:00,139
seem to have lost my protection there we

832
00:31:52,250 --> 00:32:01,760
go so yeah so so that's the underlying

833
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:04,279
piece that we need in order to let

834
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,970
people sort of flood the network we're

835
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,080
the encrypted mail that's the hope so do

836
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,450
you folks want to know about how it

837
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,879
works under the hood for this setting up

838
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,289
or your other mail app so your be

839
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,929
surprised to hear this but it's really

840
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,760
stupid like all the other technology

841
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,299
that I'm describing here the solution

842
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,299
the solution

843
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:33,019
is we're gonna send ourselves email so

844
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,529
we're gonna take the secret key that we

845
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,549
need in our mutual mode setting and

846
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:39,200
we're gonna bundle them up in an

847
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,389
encrypted email of a certain format

848
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,539
that's well-defined and we're gonna send

849
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:46,939
it to ourselves and then on the other

850
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:48,379
mail user agent we're going to look for

851
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,869
email that meets that particular

852
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,759
standard and in order to be sure that

853
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,809
we've got the same one the encryption is

854
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,729
going to be just a symmetric encryption

855
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:57,489
between the two messages and we'll just

856
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:59,479
decrypt the message there and import it

857
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:00,739
which will give us the secret key

858
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,409
material that we need to decrypt

859
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:06,470
messages and allow us to import the

860
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:09,529
mutual mode setting as well so again the

861
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,539
underlying tech not fancy and that's our

862
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,309
goal actually is to be not fancy we want

863
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,960
mail user agents to be relatively to

864
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:17,059
have it relatively easy to like pick

865
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,859
that up and work with it

866
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:23,720
so yeah so again an adversary who wants

867
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:26,960
to screw with you who has access to your

868
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,899
mail spool will be able to defeat you in

869
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,539
this scenario but an adversary who comes

870
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:34,459
in grabs your mails pool after the fact

871
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:36,739
or who doesn't want to potentially get

872
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,479
noticed won't be able to do anything

873
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:41,739
about it you'll just be able to flood

874
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:44,960
the network with encryption there so

875
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:46,489
yeah so we want we want people who use

876
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
email to get involved and you can do

877
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:51,190
that as simply by us by installing an

878
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,689
app that's all decrypt capable and

879
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,970
turning it on remember that's the

880
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,330
training install another capable app and

881
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,309
turn it on we want trainers to get

882
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,649
involved come and tell us what doesn't

883
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:05,928
make sense here come and tell us what

884
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:07,789
would make things easier for you we want

885
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,770
use user interface and user experience

886
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,690
designers to come help us tune the

887
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,369
existing implementations and the

888
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,829
existing theory behind like what should

889
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,089
the interface look like we want protocol

890
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:19,250
designers to take a look at the

891
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:21,859
constructs that we have I'm pretty sure

892
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,809
our concepts are really stupid right and

893
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,460
we don't want you to come in and say hey

894
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:29,169
we've got this cool new construct and

895
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,168
the only thing that users have to do is

896
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,619
well first they have to make a series of

897
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,089
complicated choices and then those

898
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,409
choices if they intersect well with the

899
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,750
other people's to it like we don't want

900
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,490
that kind of protocol design

901
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,960
but if the product if you're looking at

902
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:46,199
the auto cab setup message for example

903
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,090
in the way that we do the the setup code

904
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,560
to help sync up these devices we'd love

905
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,830
to hear your feedback on that kind of

906
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,629
stuff and we're also looking for a male

907
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,240
user agent developers to come and tell

908
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:00,640
us like is this implementable what do we

909
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,020
need done we've also got next steps I'd

910
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,629
mentioned that in a future version we

911
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,640
plan to defend or at least detect active

912
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,640
attackers so you might think that that

913
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,930
means fingerprint verification right or

914
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,420
something something along those lines

915
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,970
safety number checks I think they call

916
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,810
it in signal private messenger so I want

917
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,640
radical rethinking of this I want I want

918
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,680
people who are into gamified user

919
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,359
interfaces to come and talk to us about

920
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,549
a proposal that they think might work

921
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,359
between now remember between a group of

922
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:34,180
heterogeneous mail user agents what if

923
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,040
what if the same little dopamine hit

924
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,109
that you got by like finding out you got

925
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,700
a new friend on Facebook or whatever you

926
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:42,310
could get from your mail user agent that

927
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,770
said yes you just like establish that

928
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:47,230
you like you this is you and your

929
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,839
autocrat buddy now like what can we do

930
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,700
to make that kind of experience the the

931
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,049
user level experience and have that also

932
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,669
in addition give them some level of

933
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,080
protection against active attackers so

934
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,349
that we're looking for we're looking for

935
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,970
folks to who have that kind of idea in

936
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:10,000
mind so the ways that you can help like

937
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,919
this is by using it right giving us

938
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,830
feedback encouraging other people to use

939
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,300
it let us know when it's not working we

940
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,819
need that you know email infrastucture

941
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,890
needs to work and if it doesn't work we

942
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,630
need to know that it's broken if you

943
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,000
come to the workshop that's later today

944
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,190
you can have some experience with it I

945
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,800
regret to say that in my talk I showed

946
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:33,250
you like the nice simple thing not all

947
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,599
implementations are there yet but the

948
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,040
more pressure that those implementers

949
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,750
get from folks who are like I'm excited

950
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,130
about this I want to use it and it's

951
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,859
still not simple enough

952
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,270
make it simpler we love feedback like

953
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,830
that if you can tell us where things

954
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:49,300
went wrong where you got stuck we want

955
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:51,269
to know and and if you're a developer I

956
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,009
strongly encourage you to come and

957
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:54,959
talk to us and look at ways that you can

958
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:56,489
do it you might find what you'll find in

959
00:36:54,959 --> 00:37:00,149
the discussion group I mean I think I've

960
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:02,939
got a slide with like pointers yeah so

961
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:06,058
there's a website there's a higher seat

962
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:07,558
channel there's a mailing list these are

963
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,929
some of the implementations here it's

964
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:15,989
enigmail and k9 and delta chat are three

965
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:18,659
of them there you might find that it's a

966
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:21,509
welcoming group we're kind of a know

967
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,979
like a no assholes group we want people

968
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:27,569
to be able to come and participate and

969
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:29,218
if you're a male user agent developer or

970
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:32,038
any of these other if you're a user

971
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:34,140
interface designer or you've got

972
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:39,209
communications ideas we want you to come

973
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:41,848
and work with us so yeah so that's my

974
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,288
basic pitch for why auto crypt is what I

975
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:45,029
hope will be the thing that takes us

976
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:47,459
towards actually not having as much

977
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:49,679
clear text mail and future versions of

978
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:51,959
AutoCAD FeliCa level up on a base that

979
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,929
we build today by giving them additional

980
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:57,288
protections tomorrow so that's the basic

981
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:59,699
idea and I would love to take questions

982
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:01,859
out including questions that are

983
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:05,449
critical I'd love to I'd love to hear

984
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:05,449
what people are thinking about this

985
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:12,609
Thanks

986
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:15,049
[Applause]

987
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:18,770
like it seems like a large majority

988
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,240
users just want to use webmail yes on

989
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,819
the computer is never mind the fact that

990
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,430
probably some like Gmail on their phones

991
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:28,520
yep okay so that's great thank you for

992
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,259
raising that point one of the few things

993
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,329
that Auto crypt has refused to

994
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,869
compromise on is the idea that you do

995
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:38,510
need to use an email program now that's

996
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:40,130
a disappointment for as you said a lot

997
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,410
of people who prefer to just use webmail

998
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:45,770
but the fact is if your goal is to

999
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:47,058
provide unreadable mail for the people

1000
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,980
that you really don't want to read your

1001
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:51,680
mail you do need to be in control of the

1002
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,329
mail reading experience so straight-up

1003
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,839
webmail like I can walk into an

1004
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:58,670
arbitrary internet cafe and pull up a

1005
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,190
browser on an arbitrary computer and

1006
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,420
read my encrypted mail that doesn't

1007
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,040
actually work I'm sure there are folks

1008
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,470
in here you can give a more detailed

1009
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,140
rundown of why that doesn't work but

1010
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,848
essentially you can't use somebody

1011
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,379
else's machinery to get clear text

1012
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:18,109
access to a thing that that you want to

1013
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,650
keep from the person who controls that

1014
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:23,990
machinery that said webmail with an

1015
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,059
extension where your browser could have

1016
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,180
an extension that basically the

1017
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,589
extension becomes the mail user agent is

1018
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,049
something that we do want to support and

1019
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:33,980
we're in discussions with Melville op'

1020
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:36,319
hopefully we can get Melville up on

1021
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,990
board and other folks who have a webmail

1022
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:41,210
model as well as far as the Gmail app

1023
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,020
goes I don't know whether gee Google

1024
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,640
would be interested in this Google

1025
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,940
supposedly had an end to end thing

1026
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,379
planned and it never kind of like

1027
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,579
drifted off so I don't know if they're

1028
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,410
willing to come back and work with us

1029
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,349
but if they are the Gmail we'd love to

1030
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,910
see the Gmail app adopt this but you can

1031
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:58,400
also just install a different app and

1032
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,220
connect it to your Gmail account so

1033
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,750
thanks for raising that yep so this

1034
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,240
might be an early morning I missed it

1035
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,420
thing but one of the problems with PGP

1036
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,839
is that it just bleeds metadata you know

1037
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,380
I mean from lines subject lines you know

1038
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,119
are still are still in clear text and so

1039
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,099
forth so could you stay a little bit

1040
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,009
more about you know how you plan to

1041
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:25,319
adjust the mail reading experience

1042
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:26,640
yeah thank you for raising that so it's

1043
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,079
not just a problem with PGP it's a

1044
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,509
problem with all encrypted mail right

1045
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,640
now ask mine as well I was just at the

1046
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:35,730
IETF the internet Engineering Task Force

1047
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,500
in Montreal in the lamps working group

1048
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,089
which stands for something to do with

1049
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,690
encrypted mail I don't remember how they

1050
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:44,730
work out that acronym and there are

1051
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,130
proposals on the table both in the IETF

1052
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,519
and outside for protecting email headers

1053
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,890
this email is a classic example where if

1054
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,479
susan has access to the mail spool she

1055
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,009
can see the plans for Susan's birthday

1056
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,890
because the only thing that was

1057
00:40:56,009 --> 00:41:00,480
encrypted was the body several different

1058
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,848
mail user agents including both canine

1059
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,069
and enigmail now have the capacity to do

1060
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:06,859
protected subject lines so that doesn't

1061
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:08,788
protect the from line and the to line

1062
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,109
but it protects the subject which is

1063
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:12,089
arguably the most important piece of

1064
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:14,279
metadata and the mechanisms for doing

1065
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:17,220
that these protected headers so-called

1066
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:18,839
are capable of extending to the rest of

1067
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,189
the interface for the rest of the

1068
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,690
headers as well but there are some

1069
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,779
deliverability and readability problems

1070
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,670
for things like from and to but we are

1071
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:28,349
trying to address that problem too

1072
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,240
that's a stupid paper cut that again we

1073
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,680
should have fixed thirty years ago so

1074
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,149
thank you for raising that it's not

1075
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,319
officially part of Auto crypto fix it

1076
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,190
but we will hopefully fix it in the

1077
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:40,259
broader email ecosystem yep so you said

1078
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,359
previously that when you're sending keys

1079
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:43,980
to another device you basically send

1080
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,390
yourself an email and it's symmetrically

1081
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,170
encrypted where do you get the key for

1082
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,799
that symmetric thus the initial auto

1083
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:55,230
crypt enabled device generates a high

1084
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:58,470
entropy we call the auto crypt setup

1085
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,089
code and so when you say add another

1086
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,700
Auto code enabled device to my account

1087
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:04,500
it generates a setup code uses it to

1088
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,450
encrypt it jet builds the setup message

1089
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,400
the self sent message encrypts it with

1090
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,799
the setup code shows the user the setup

1091
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,150
code and then sends the message in the

1092
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:13,799
background and then the user pulls it up

1093
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,029
and types a setup code in so the goal is

1094
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,470
not to have the user have to come up

1095
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:18,180
with high entropy anything anywhere

1096
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,569
you'll note also that there were no

1097
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:30,250
passwords involved thanks

1098
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:32,860
I when someone makes a an autocrat proxy

1099
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,990
are there any plans to you use a

1100
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:39,730
protocol like diffie-hellman to detect

1101
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:42,580
message modification so an autocrat

1102
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,770
proxy is not currently something that

1103
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,770
I'm super keen on I'm sure someone will

1104
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:51,880
make one you're talking about something

1105
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:54,100
that's doing a malicious rewrite yes so

1106
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,020
I think the way that we defeat the

1107
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,339
active adversary so like I said the

1108
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,960
baseline Auto crip does not defend

1109
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,900
against an active adversary if they want

1110
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,340
to attack they can attack and our hope

1111
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,540
is that the next version of Auto crypt

1112
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,610
which will hopefully come out within the

1113
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,170
next year will provide detection

1114
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,040
mechanisms for being able to see that

1115
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,330
that's happening you don't need

1116
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,400
diffie-hellman you simply need key

1117
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,840
agreement mechanisms so we that is on

1118
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,280
the roadmap but it's not going to be

1119
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,650
handled for the first version we want

1120
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,490
the first version to be easier to deploy

1121
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:25,750
thank you hey Daniel I just wanted to

1122
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:28,720
know with Auto crypt the the standard

1123
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:31,810
mail user agent encryption up until now

1124
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,859
has been PGP alright so you know the the

1125
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,620
standard mail client will give you a

1126
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:38,020
check box or a button to say encrypt

1127
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,180
this mail yep and Auto crypt essentially

1128
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,430
has the same thing yeah and it may do it

1129
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,580
automatically by default what happens if

1130
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:48,339
you're trying to use PGP with someone

1131
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:51,490
who you've also done all equipped with

1132
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,560
so thank you for the question the

1133
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,779
confusion I understand a confusion I

1134
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,190
would make let me let me let me I see

1135
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,910
your confusion and I raise you some

1136
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:03,160
confusion the standard is actually the

1137
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:05,560
most widely implemented mail user agent

1138
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,020
encryption mechanism is s/mime not PGP

1139
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,270
and when you encrypt a message today to

1140
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,520
someone you'll find that if you've

1141
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:14,050
installed PGP and you're then you

1142
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,530
actually sometimes do get two different

1143
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:19,870
ways to encrypt and so the goal for Auto

1144
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,650
crypt is to hide all of that complexity

1145
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,319
from the user

1146
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,840
the fact is under the hood auto crypt is

1147
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,840
using PGP so the fact that you say

1148
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,150
encrypt to this person it's going to be

1149
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,040
PGP anyway but they don't need to know

1150
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,339
we don't need that letters PGP we don't

1151
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,140
need to know about like

1152
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,939
the client needs to make those decisions

1153
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,499
for the user and if the client ever

1154
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:40,999
presents the user with a confusing

1155
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:43,549
situation where they have two choices of

1156
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:46,279
how they encrypt the client has failed

1157
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:47,749
in my opinion so the goal that you're

1158
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:49,279
absolutely right that's a concern and

1159
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:50,779
clients should be aware of it and the

1160
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,589
goal is users shouldn't have to

1161
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:55,009
experience it at all

1162
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:56,989
if that's the case then is usually with

1163
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:58,819
let's say a nig mail yep you would have

1164
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:01,339
a choice of let's say which key to

1165
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:03,170
encrypt with would this be like you'd

1166
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:06,349
have an interface tool in say choose

1167
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,509
auto crypt versus the goal here for an

1168
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:10,430
offer auto crypt for for a pure Auto

1169
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:12,880
Craft implementation would be there's no

1170
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,140
visibility for the users of keys at all

1171
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,400
in the event that you have someone who's

1172
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,078
operating in a kind of mixed mode

1173
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,609
they've done some kind of nerdery on the

1174
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:25,069
side well that nerdery needs to be clear

1175
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:27,049
about what they're doing if the if that

1176
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:29,209
nerdery gets in the way of auto cad

1177
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:30,469
providing a simple and easy answer then

1178
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:33,558
it

1179
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:35,689
I will I will sort of hope that people

1180
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,489
can trim it down but yeah the goal for

1181
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:39,348
Auto crypt is not know the user doesn't

1182
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:41,959
have to make decisions like that yep

1183
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:44,569
just curious what happens if you receive

1184
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:46,069
a public key in the header that doesn't

1185
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:49,459
match one that you already received in

1186
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:53,359
the past right that's a great question

1187
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:55,759
so in the event of in it we call that a

1188
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,288
key change event we have a set of rules

1189
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:59,569
for the mail user agent of what to do

1190
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:01,219
when it receives a message which has an

1191
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,808
auto crypt header or even a message that

1192
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,160
got that two message in two minutes left

1193
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:05,150
even if it receives a message that

1194
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,759
doesn't have an auto crypt header

1195
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,410
there's a set of rules about how you

1196
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:11,689
keep track of that and what you do and

1197
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,149
those rules basically imply the result

1198
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:16,879
of a key change in the current version

1199
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,650
their auto clip will not alert on a key

1200
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,329
change and we hope that people who are

1201
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,910
interested in user experience will come

1202
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,499
and talk to us about how we can do how

1203
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,459
we can transform key change events into

1204
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:27,558
something that the user can actually

1205
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:28,788
understand the reason for that is that

1206
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:30,019
there are legitimate cases where you

1207
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,489
might have a key change event like

1208
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,129
someone installs and reinstalls the

1209
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:35,869
application or they lost their device

1210
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,569
and so at the moment we don't have a

1211
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:40,670
defense against that yeah people like to

1212
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,739
ask me what kind of email they should

1213
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,330
use and if I'm going to be recommending

1214
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,550
or what

1215
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:47,080
an email to them and I want to plant the

1216
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:50,020
seeds for them to be using auto crypt at

1217
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,759
some point what are the best choices you

1218
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:55,930
said a web client email I'm not sure

1219
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,750
what that means lately gmail.com or rise

1220
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:01,750
up net so the answer is auto clip will

1221
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:05,170
work with any email provider okay as

1222
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:08,230
long as that provider gives the the mail

1223
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:11,410
user agent a the ability to send email

1224
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:14,620
with arbitrary headers and arbitrary

1225
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:16,839
content types and bodies and B the

1226
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,100
ability to receive email like those are

1227
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,080
the two things that we haven't been able

1228
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,540
to squeeze out of the requirements yet

1229
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,560
but as long as your mail provider allows

1230
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,060
those things Auto clip should work yep

1231
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,600
one more question and then I gotta close

1232
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,190
it up fine

1233
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,390
so did I might have missed it during the

1234
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,430
talk but did you have any plans for

1235
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,990
making kind of backups easy or things

1236
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,609
like this so if I lose the device or I

1237
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,950
lose my private keys I know I don't know

1238
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,780
about keys but what happens to me that's

1239
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,339
great that's a so there's a whole bunch

1240
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,400
of additional research that we hope that

1241
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,650
auto clip will open up not just backups

1242
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,020
but actually search there's a bunch of

1243
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,150
usability issues where some current mail

1244
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,800
user agents if they have encrypted

1245
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,180
messages can't even search for them

1246
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,260
which means people are like oh don't

1247
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,940
send it to me encrypted because I want

1248
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,710
to be able to search for it later so I

1249
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,150
think if we get this stuff working it

1250
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,530
will encourage us to make a lot of

1251
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,090
changes to the way we think about

1252
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,860
handling encrypted mail but that's

1253
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,630
backups or not I have a bunch of ideas

1254
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,830
about that if you want to talk to me

1255
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,810
about them later that would be fine

1256
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,160
we are just about out of time I would

1257
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,390
love to take the last two questions that

1258
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,799
are in line but I also want to make sure

1259
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,859
the next speaker has a chance to come up

1260
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,440
and talk so I think I would probably I'm

1261
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,420
probably going to get the this signal so

1262
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,820
I'm around afterwards there's a workshop

1263
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,960
at 15 o'clock in Paris if you're

1264
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,610
interested and you want to try it out

1265
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,930
come try it out the workshop you don't

1266
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,190
have to use your existing email address

1267
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,080
if you don't want to if you're scared

1268
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,370
about it I'll have some demo email

1269
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,529
accounts you can use if you just want to

1270
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,299
try it out there so thank you all for

1271
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,110
coming I know it was super early and I'm

1272
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,400
sorry we didn't get through the whole

1273
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,829
night laughs thanks

1274
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,829
[Applause]
