much it's great to be back at hope I was

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,790
here at the last one doing a very sort

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,480
of proto version of this talk and I met

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,370
a JavaScript programmer Ziggy Mintz who

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,369
helped make the Brooklyn pirate radio

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,560
sound map first I want to ask where the

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,779
FCC guys sitting okay I know you don't

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
want to give it away so welcome to

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:20,220
was it a love order table was it a love

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:34,119
was it a the void or whatever it is but

21
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,070
we are still a family and we do continue

22
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,770
to provide that service for this

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,929
community at least the authorities

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,610
coming down on the solution to fix in

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,710
this situation then they they they doing

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,229
it so maybe we won't think about it

27
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,669
again until today we're not shaming what

28
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,560
we're doing it and really continue to

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,759
donate phone to God give you the

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:59,140
opportunity to work

31
00:01:51,759 --> 00:02:01,630
that's fortunately so I'm gonna give you

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,539
the labor land for a few minutes and

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,429
then we'll check out the map pirate

34
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,709
radio in Brooklyn is in a very active

35
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,959
phase right now the continuation of a

36
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:14,400
spike in unlicensed broadcasting on the

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,390
FM band that began about 25 years ago I

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,570
estimate that there are currently over

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,000
100 pirate stations on the air in all of

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,340
New York City more than the licensed

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,920
stations in Flatbush Brooklyn where I

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,250
live and listen it's routine to hear

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,768
about 36 stations every night they sign

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,060
on in late afternoon and they stay on

45
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,150
into the wee hours and sometimes all

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,890
night on weekends they broadcast

47
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,860
straight through from Friday night to

48
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,500
Monday morning my take on urban pirate

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,350
radio which is also prevalent in Miami

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,260
and Boston is there's more to it than

51
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,530
just the aspects of what's legal and

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,179
what's not the claims of interference to

53
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,280
license stations are real and the

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,890
Pirates often plague small legal

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,470
non-commercial broadcasters like w FM u

56
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,179
there's actually a very active Twitter

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,810
feed the Brooklyn pirate watch which

58
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:11,170
sprung up sort of in opposition to the

59
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,769
interference on WFMU you there are other

63
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,560
these are often overblown by the powers

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,560
that be

covered in the press is the bad guys law

breakers with nothing valuable to offer

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,230
for this project I've talked with people

78
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,040
on both sides of the legal divide I'm

79
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,020
interested in how and why this ad hoc

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,110
locally focused internally uncooperative

81
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,380
community radio movement claimed its own

82
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,360
space on the FM band why do the Pirates

83
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,000
emanate such a high level of radio

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,900
frequency energy this deep into the

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,060
digital age

86
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,799
how will they deal with an intensifying

87
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,169
government focus on cracking down on

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,160
pirate radio that came in with a jet

89
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:10,140
pilot rump administration pirate radio

90
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,810
in New York City goes back to the least

91
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,150
of 70s and was mostly the domain of tech

92
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,560
savvy pranksters playing oldies and

93
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,539
sending up the radio of the day they

94
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,090
also liked sort of playing cat-and-mouse

95
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,860
with Judah miles Bach who was the field

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,140
investigator at the time they would

97
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,970
listen on their own VHF frequencies and

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,210
when they heard him coming close they'd

99
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,010
turn off the transmitter and then they

100
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,120
would hear him say what happened they

101
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,789
just went off the air so activity was

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,440
limited to a few stations late at night

103
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,640
usually on ninety one five and ninety

104
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,130
one nine those were the pirate

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,050
frequencies of the day in 1982 there was

106
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,770
a New York Times article which said

107
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,160
there were 12

108
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:54,240
stations on and there was wxy in Long

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,270
Island and stereo nine in Queens it was

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,190
an interesting scene but very small

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,568
compared to this one I'm gonna give you

112
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,409
a little sample but in the prominent

113
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,909
Brooklyn stations WH ot so this this is

114
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:10,500
very much back then this from 1988 seems

115
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:14,150
like by a computer is frozen up

116
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,150
notice how I'm keeping my composure

117
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,960
alright well we'll come back to that I

118
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,340
do have some other things I can read

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,349
well we restart so we'll hear the sample

120
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,419
when I come back the current phase of

121
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:33,840
pirate broadcasting started around the

122
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:39,960
mid 90s and was ignited by a combination

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,669
of factors the hub the first one the

124
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,530
high cost of entry for conventional

125
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,378
media in the new in the New York City

126
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,719
area it cost many hundreds of dollars in

127
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,750
Howard for airtime seventy five million

128
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:54,690
or more to buy a station three hundred

129
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,969
million dollars now number two in the

130
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,069
late 70s the licensing of stations under

131
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:01,560
100 watts was eliminated those were the

132
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,750
Class D stations and that meant fewer

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,319
options for a localized service for

134
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,930
small communities three cuts to FCC

135
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,090
enforcement in the 90s while the number

136
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,699
of pirate stations was starting to

137
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,159
increase and that provided a kind of

138
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,039
safety in numbers and and does today

139
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,569
short of a quasi military invasion it

140
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:27,800
would be difficult to take them all off

141
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:30,210
and keep them off for the passing of the

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,190
Telecommunications Act of 1996

143
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,169
which allowed for up to eight stations

144
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,300
per owner in large radio markets like

145
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,599
New York City this led to the

146
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,449
consolidation of formats and a lack of

147
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,639
diversity on the air five newly

148
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,580
available inexpensive and easy to use

149
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,949
transmitters from China and also that

150
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,330
we're being home-brewed by tech people

151
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:56,759
in the US during the micro broadcasting

152
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,710
craze which was also prevalent in the

153
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,560
90s some would say it was really on the

154
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,169
order of a civil disobedience

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,210
the hair some people estimate that

156
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,609
across the country in the mid to late

157
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:13,669
90s were about a thousand unlicensed

158
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,870
radio stations the final reason at least

159
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,590
for the moment they're probably other

160
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:23,510
reasons there's a strong cultural

161
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:25,789
imperative for immigrant communities to

162
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,219
establish their own local radio voice

163
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,070
this coupled with easier access to

164
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,930
technology overrode what the existing

165
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,919
laws could do to keep the pirate's laugh

166
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,689
at them this project looks at the

167
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,909
Brooklyn pirates and was funded in part

168
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,440
by the Brooklyn Arts Council eventually

169
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,839
I want to expand it to the rest of the

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,130
city and in the map when you see it the

171
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,330
tuner is under the faceplate

172
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,790
pre-programmed to go to other parts of

173
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,860
the city as well and each part of New

174
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,020
York City has its own pirate radio

175
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,870
neighborhood with different flavors

176
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,449
Brooklyn is primarily West Indian a

177
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,160
little Orthodox Jewish Queens is

178
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,320
primarily a Dominican and other kinds of

179
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,449
Latino culture with one Asian pirate the

180
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,690
Bronx is mostly Latino with a little bit

181
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,540
of Caribbean and suburban New Jersey is

182
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,700
a mix of Haitian and in Paterson New

183
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:25,699
Jersey a lot of Latino stations I think

184
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,160
that the sound map as a sonic

185
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,560
ethnography with a couple helpings of

186
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,560
journalism fueled by radio geek

187
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,650
obsessiveness to discover the shape of

188
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,420
the scene I've spent a lot of time

189
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,220
recording over night for hours

190
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,650
a lot of these stations they don't ID

191
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,720
frequently or some of them never do some

192
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,750
of them are just musical jukeboxes but

193
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,430
with a lot of listening and recording

194
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,110
and looking back through the tapes I've

195
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,650
been able to identify most of the

196
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,010
stations

197
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:58,939
most of which have websites streaming

198
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,740
audio they're on phones on audio now and

199
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,209
their own radio that's still very

200
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,459
fervently using the radio listeners in

201
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,309
the community they often just gravitate

202
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,679
to a few stations that are target

203
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,978
where they live or a few stations that

204
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,769
they like and we're doing on the street

205
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:20,209
like you know say to you what you listen

206
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,539
do you know about boom stations you know

207
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,848
about S&S do you know about we vibes and

208
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,739
most of them say well I listen to

209
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:28,519
YouTube I get a lot of my music on

210
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:32,720
soundcloud

211
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,519
the ones who do know them they they

212
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,869
don't know they're illegal they just

213
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,009
they've been around so long that they

214
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:41,839
accept them just as radio stations so

215
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,879
these recordings made over the past four

216
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,549
years they capture close-up expressions

217
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:49,399
of local neighborhood life and as part

218
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:52,220
of the map they create an historico l--

219
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:57,919
audio record of the diasporas settled in

220
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,149
brooklyn okay let's go to the map don't

221
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,609
come on that guy lean for they all

222
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,439
intonation on two plays RL we're gonna

223
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:05,989
come back to that when the map loads I'm

224
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:08,110
just gonna refresh it it loads playing a

225
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:09,580
random sound

226
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,170
[Music]

227
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,970
these are all from my archive that I've

228
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,949
recorded over the past four years I

229
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:21,740
would like eventually to have a live

230
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:29,300
tuner that you control the Lord promises

231
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:32,920
ie any man he says he will make I'll go

232
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,920
back to the whe later

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,720

I didn't realize you ready to see your

249
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,890
mouth

250
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,170
there's you can tune up and down the

251
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,760
dial and there's an archive section

252
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,170
where you can hear more samples in the

253
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,300
station that's playing and those samples

254
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,290
will play continuously and that's what

255
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,199
we're hearing now we're hearing

256
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,349
additional samples of choice

[Applause]

261
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,880
this station is in all the vegetation

262
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,979
for the West Indian community called

263
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,500
choice video and most stations have some

264
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,330
religious content there are a few that

265
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,260
are tied to churches and it's all

266
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:28,720
religion all the time

267
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,720
our yesterday a crescent yeah

268
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,709
all right the Creston ones how far did

269
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:38,720
these radio stations would reach it

270
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:42,230
could be as little as 24 blocks or as

271
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,020
far as 27 miles that's the part this one

272
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,050
I've heard from New Jersey I'd say for

273
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:53,600
the most part two to three miles

274
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:55,870
sometimes more oh boy all right I can

275
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,870
just see

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,150
all right so see I thought I was

277
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,080
listening for the losin odds but I

278
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:08,410
didn't hear anything

279
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:11,110
thank you for that so anyway I hope this

280
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,600
doesn't throw the time up to par so this

281
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:31,120
is the sound map and it works this way

282
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:34,510
by clicking on the tuning arrows another

283
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,040
Houston station and so here's what I was

284
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,220
talking about earlier you can hit the

285
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,370
archive button and hear additional

286
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:58,510
samples you can keep the the button open

287
00:14:42,370 --> 00:15:00,010
the archive so in the on the tuner you

288
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,340
see the name of the station

289
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,520
the frequency number the file name and

290
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,130
the date the day the month and year it

291
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,980
was recorded and if I have it a logo of

292
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,890
the station and then there's a

293
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,410
designation that says on-air off-air or

294
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,210
sporadic if it's off air it means in the

295
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,520
four years I've been recording that

296
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,280
station is no longer on the air if it

297
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:30,430
says sporadic it means it's hard to tell

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:32,910
it's on very occasionally so the other

299
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,229
way this works and let me close this is

300
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,870
the map portion so that you have these

301
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,280
three zones

302
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,020
let's click the middle zone which is the

303
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,650
most populous and you get a list of all

304
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,710
the stations that broadcast to that zone

305
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,100
I am NOT saying that all these stations

306
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,870
are located here in fact looking at some

307
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,840
FCC notices lately

308
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,700
a prominent station which broadcasts to

309
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,270
Flatbush is actually was in Carroll

310
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,780
Gardens and there was a case of another

311
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:06,520
station fire station one or 104.7 they

312
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,290
were broadcasting from a skyscraper in

313
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,490
Manhattan

314
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:14,400
when they were caught so however you can

315
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:17,010
walk up and down the street and I'll you

316
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,540
can see antennas on roofs that's are

317
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,080
likely pirate radio antennas of the 36

318
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,110
stations

319
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,260
I hear each night about a third of them

320
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,660
are Haitian and served served acquiesce

321
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,689
peeking community there are at least

322
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,630
80,000 Haitians living in Flatbush and

323
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,160
lately it's been designated as Little

324
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:44,010
Haiti officially by the city government

325
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,969
so 12 radio stations is a lot and there

326
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:49,770
are they come on all the time new ones

327
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,520
so one of the things I've been learning

328
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,480
and doing this project is that

329
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,310
especially in the Haitian community

330
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,030
there's a strong cultural need for these

331
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,520
stations Haitians living in under the

332
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:06,629
Duvalier regime from 1957

333
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,060
laulima a taboo in love would always

334
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,210
watch NSF activities are illegal early

335
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,358
twenties

336
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,358
[Applause]

337
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:32,179
as at least less honest a flicky bless

338
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:33,950
the tie-breaking on the radio night day

339
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,380
yeah nice icky things that I might

340
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,519
generally as for the Christ in it sounds

341
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,409
like I was getting playback from

342
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,409
somewhere else let's go back to the map

343
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,769
typical

344
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,760
Oh Shelby no oh no no you Shawn this is

345
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,910
one of the Orthodox Jewish stations so

346
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,150
now I'm just sort of going off script so

347
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,250
that buzz that you heard was on for

348
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:07,020
about 24 hours during the the whole

349
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:09,790
Sabbath the station stops programming

350
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,610
yeah at dusk on Friday

351
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,190
and usually they just keep a silent

352
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,379
signal on to keep other stations off the

353
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:22,600
frequency and they're blocking wrhu

354
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,130
Hofstra's College Station but I tuned in

355
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
and it was like oh there was this bus so

356
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,390
I just hit record to see how long it

357
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,120
would last and a lesson until the end of

358
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,590
the Sabbath and then they came back on

359
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,330
there was an there was another station

360
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,860
Jamie radio which is not off the air

361
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,860
which I heard on the air during the

362
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,879
Sabbath and I see him not plugged in

363
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,520
either so actually I texted them because

364
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,940
all these stations have online presences

365
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,350
and emails and they said no we were not

366
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,820
on the Sabbath and I said well you were

367
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,909
and I guess if they knew they couldn't

368
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,290
say or they you know but they probably

369
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,120
didn't know so there's a lot of

370
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,399
automation induced errors that goes on

371
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,080
with these stations so what I wanted to

372
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,080
play it talked a little bit about the

373
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,220
Haitian community here I'm gonna play

374
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,220
radhiya independence

375
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,830
hola

376
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:30,600
[Music]

377
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,080
yo your one booklet Medici walls it

378
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,080
makes my

379
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:45,969
[Music]

380
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,280
so these stations they offer a mix of

381
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,290
music but but news is really important

382
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,580
to them as I was saying - they still

383
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,580
contact Eileen for that on

384
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,090
international to place a limit on the

385
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,530
Phillies affinity of a Jew yeah

386
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,439
information as you know they take

387
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,870
advantage would be any me you don't

388
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,020
sign up at you but you do yeah let's

389
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,209
unless your objective

390
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,210
[Applause]

391
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,570
at dawn Co attention is at the airport

392
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:35,280
program for a flash speech I was at that

393
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:37,590
wonderful Club for a flash speciate so

394
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,360
these stations they offer live feeds

395
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,189
from Haiti they have the community

396
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,610
calling in asking what's going on

397
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,230
there's there's a this station brownie

398
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,780
Lumiere is interesting it's actually a

399
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:54,299
Haitian station which is relayed here on

400
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:57,059
87.9 just below the FM band and they

401
00:20:54,299 --> 00:21:00,500
were the first Creole speaking station

402
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:03,240
in Haiti because at the time in the 50s

403
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,490
it was all in French for the elite and

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,640
Creole which is what most of the speak

405
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,380
people spoke as the vernacular was not

406
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,990
available on the radio so first was

407
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,330
radio Lumiere and then there was radio

408
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,130
Haiti which was a very the really the

409
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,379
oak this was a religious station in

410
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,750
Creole but later in the 60s or was a

411
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,059
radio Haiti and I believe there's a

412
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,409
Jonathan Demi Phil called the agronomist

413
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,450
which is about the founder of that

414
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:30,270
station he was eventually assassinated

415
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,320
by the government during that time there

416
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,158
was something called the transistor

417
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,689
revolution

418
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,730
the Haitians will keep a transistor

419
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,789
radio under the bed so they could listen

420
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:42,480
to independent news from outside of the

421
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,950
island so where I live Haitian is like

422
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,289
the dominant flavor and I'm just going

423
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:50,669
to play I'm also working on a

424
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:53,059
documentary for BBC World Service so I

425
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,900
found a young woman who is a

426
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,270
correspondent on some of the Haitian

427
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,950
stations her name is Joni Martinez she

428
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,730
is comfortable with using her name and

429
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,400
she's also making her own film about

430
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,919
about these stations so if we can get my

431
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,400
audio to play here where this is a

432
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,850
little walk down Little Haiti and then

433
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,850
something from Joan

434
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,920
right now we're standing on the corner

435
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,690
of Clarendon road and Nostrand Avenue in

436
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,810
the heart of Brooklyn which I called one

437
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,580
of like the center's fresh it's like

438
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,200
another little Haiti

439
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,260
kind of like you have like the notorious

440
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,420
the famous Little Haiti in Miami so this

441
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,250
is like another version of that but the

442
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,990
truth is it's like anywhere you see like

443
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:44,790
a cluster of you know Haitian Americans

444
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,460
Haitians you know you know they live

445
00:22:44,790 --> 00:23:05,879
here they work here they shop around

446
00:22:47,460 --> 00:23:09,270
here Guinea we had Josie Superman's

447
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,160
avocado avocado tonight I came across it

448
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,620
at a very young age I was probably like

449
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,050
maybe three four or five years old and

450
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,510
there was this really popular station

451
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,909
back in the late 80s called ad yogini

452
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,040
and it was based in Brooklyn nobody

453
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,330
knows where it was there are suspicions

454
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,670
but all I know is from Friday night all

455
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,490
the way to Sunday night you would just

456
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,710
hear a series of these stations

457
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,320
I only remember like one or two DJ's one

458
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,140
of them was Wilson Daisy ER this

459
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,520
legendary journalist amazing guy when he

460
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,220
passed it was just like the horrible

461
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,920
thing however when I was a kid we would

462
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,930
listen to Roger guinea every weekend and

463
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,760
it would be the place where you could

464
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,910
listen to the latest in Haitian pop

465
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:56,280
music Asian rap music it was also news

466
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,780
my parents and their friends would all

467
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,670
sit around the radio and it would just

468
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,670
be politicking in the living room

469
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,070
getting really loud you know it was just

470
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,290
like a meeting ground and the radio was

471
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,050
guiding it some people have like TV

472
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,290
viewing parties my parents and other

473
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,510
younger Haitians they had the Haitian

474
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,180
parties where they would just listen to

475
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,250
the radio and just start politicking

476
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:25,050
right then and there or dancing singing

477
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,640
along that sort of thing I'm gonna play

478
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,830
a sample of a session called radio

479
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,320
comedy well we're not want that done

480
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:36,019
digging I just

481
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:38,720
IVA juice in La Jolla barrage Olivia but

482
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:41,750
use it while Raju

483
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,080
Quebec where see what you commit Jim

484
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,080
daddy

485
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:53,658
so this is radio comedy one of the

486
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,299
Haitian stations and they were also

487
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,519
mentioning other stations in the

488
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:00,590
community I was out a couple weekends

489
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,960
ago walking through that Bush asking

490
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,580
people about radio standing around with

491
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,639
my microphone on the corner and a

492
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,500
gentleman called me over because there

493
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,719
was all this unrest going on in Haiti it

494
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,730
was like are you journalists and he so

495
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,460
he was telling me what was going on and

496
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:19,190
halfway through he revealed himself to

497
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,370
be connected with radio comedy so I'm

498
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,990
going to play something from him and he

499
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,219
will tell you a little more about why

500
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,220
these stations are important

501
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:39,909
[Music]

502
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:52,419
the job that we're doing in this

503
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:57,099
community we know taking a risk but that

504
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:59,590
people know to value of the video but

505
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:04,539
sometimes there is things that's going

506
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:07,718
on an ad we thought was a video they

507
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:10,960
will not know what's going on so they

508
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:13,299
come to us to help them out the meaning

509
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,519
of the video most of them will you don't

510
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:29,729
you see the community in that we can

511
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:29,729
plan we we don't make money in the video

512
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:43,860
yes it's one of the most popular

513
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:47,580
but I'll get something next one's a bull

514
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:52,679
I tend to make money to bring somehow in

515
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:59,060
a doesn't mean reason that we have the

516
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:01,470
video it's an important point because

517
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,760
the forces that don't like the pirates

518
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,410
are like they're in it for the money

519
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,320
they're scamming their communities

520
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,000
they're bad actors quote-unquote which

521
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,220
you can't be if you and I have a radio

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,300
station but all those stations and

523
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,920
operators that I've managed to talk to

524
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,990
you are very passionate that these are

525
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,900
community radio stations this is

526
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:25,080
essentially a de-facto community radio

527
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,540
scene because the opportunities to have

528
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,610
a community radio station are really

529
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,590
non-existent for a number of reasons I

530
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,449
probably won't be able to get to but on

531
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,300
the website you can I have a four part

532
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,390
essay called Arab Williams / Flatbush it

533
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,419
looks at the current scene the history

534
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:44,340
the the vagaries of being clandestine

535
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,760
and then thoughts about what the future

536
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:52,610
might be I do uh before I switch to back

537
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:58,590
to the website I want to play a sample

538
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:59,969
when we get it up here so to speak a lot

539
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,459
of the stations whether they're in

540
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,500
Creole or they're in English and if the

541
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,360
ones that are not in Creole all the next

542
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,790
biggest number of stations are Jamaicans

543
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,939
you have a lot of stations orientated

544
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:15,389
for people from Grenada from Guiana from

545
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,480
Barbados st. Lucia and music to suit but

546
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:20,340
all of them across the board have

547
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,100
immigration shows will bring on a lawyer

548
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,520
who will give free advice or often offer

549
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,889
advice so here's a excerpt of a lawyer

550
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,560
Brian Figueroa who came on a station

551
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,710
called triple nine ninety-nine point

552
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,240
nine welcome to America a lot of stuff

553
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,360
is happening with amigo that's the

554
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,100
problem we have promised one to welcome

555
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,909
KKK Russian Trump does more than welcome

556
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:47,580
people to America and welcome to America

557
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,770
that's hey why shouldn't you be welcome

558
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,230
because you're black

559
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,420
you brung because you're gay because

560
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,330
you're Jeremy can because they are Trini

561
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,160
because you're Nigerian why shouldn't

562
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:01,100
you be welcome to America

563
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:05,090
that's the big problem here so

564
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,889
immigration and Trump and KKK and

565
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:10,040
Russian all go together

566
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,990
kikiki Russian Trump it is what it is

567
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,250
President of the United States of

568
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:18,920
America ain't like people of color why

569
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:22,430
because most of us become Democrats 80

570
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:26,180
90 % of all new immigrants and the

571
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,670
Republican Party headed by KKK Russia

572
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:33,710
and Trump they want to stop the flow of

573
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:36,920
us here so you hear a lot of interesting

574
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:40,400
commentary on these stations to say the

575
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,870
least I'm gonna diverge from my program

576
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,180
I'm gonna play some more sound from the

577
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:46,850
map because the sound is so interesting

578
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:50,120
and and they serve the community in

579
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,860
different ways so in the evenings you'll

580
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,929
hear a lot of stations switch on/off

581
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,899
often automatically they don't really

582
00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:03,290
have a formal sign-on they just switch

583
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:06,890
on midstream between 4 6 & 7 I have a

584
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:11,210
chart I can show you later which shows

585
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:14,300
that you know they'll be like you know

586
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,040
15 on during the day maybe five of them

587
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,600
are silent just holding the frequency

588
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,270
and then by 8 o'clock there'll be as

589
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,429
many as thirty six or seven and then by

590
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,290
7:00 in the morning they're back down to

591
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,880
like 20 and then most of them go out by

592
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:30,530
10 when people go to work but the late

593
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,660
afternoon is usually taken up with news

594
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:35,810
feeds from Jamaica from Grenada from

595
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:39,200
Haiti and then those go away and people

596
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:42,290
start mixing into the evening so I'm

597
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,420
gonna play there's a station called fire

598
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,740

the few women DJ's that I've heard it's

616
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,510
mostly a male-dominated scene it seems

617
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,970
that some of the station's are

618
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,610
programmed or run by people who own

619
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,500
businesses and the business owners may

620
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,560
be the primary programmers other

621
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:30,010
stations seem to sell time to some

programmers the station's they support

themselves often out of their own

624
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,879
pockets when I talked to the man named

625
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,670
he called himself Haitian he said people

626
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,410
call him who ran radio comedy he's part

627
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,340
of a crew of about six people that run

628
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:47,200
the station and it costs about a

629
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,419
thousand dollars a month to rent space

630
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,970
they run a basement somewhere they have

631
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,790
to pay $150 a month to the landlord and

632
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,920
they have technical concerns at some

633
00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:00,909
times their women won't get will get

634

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,250
important part of this scene is

hello to you I hope you hear this one

705
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,930
good afternoon

706
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:08,170
so most of the religion is Christian in

707
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,560
origin but I will play one exception to

708
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:24,000
that rule

709
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:24,000
[Music]

710
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:41,640

also remember you can always listen to

[Music]

723
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,810
so again I would hear this in bakeries

724
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,540
in the Jewish community near where I

725
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:26,870
live there now off the air I actually

726
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,190
went to the station he said I'm I'm I'm

727
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,810
not on the hair what are you talking

728
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,480
about someone else is doing that I don't

729
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:34,910
know who and that's a that's a defense

730
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:40,330
that I hear a lot the station that the

731
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:42,830
frequency that they were on 95.1 a legal

732
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:46,069
translator station that's a big thing

733
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:48,440
that the FCC is allowing AM stations to

734
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,240
have translators in FM so now a

735
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,970
Christian station came on ninety five

736
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,740
one and the owner of the station said

737
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,450
they targeted us they targeted our

738
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,850
community but didn't really have

739
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,069
anything to do with that per se but I

740
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:04,520
guess I could understand how he feels

741
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:05,870
and there's I talked to a bishop of a

742
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,540
church that had a really interesting

743
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:12,790
station there now off the air and he

744
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:17,540
said why is it that all the you know the

745
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:21,080
the reggae stations stay on but it's wit

746
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:22,940
crap that's targeting me but anyway

747
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:31,670
let's open it to questions why we have

748
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:34,190
time so I think probably 300 watts and

749
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:38,360
up I think some are thousands of watts I

750
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:41,330
talked to one station and check it out

751
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,730
on the future waves page a really like

752
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:46,299
very committed station in East New York

753
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:50,480
they agreed to talk to me anonymously

754
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,680
their home motivation is to be on for

755
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,500
their community to get people out to

756
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,500
community meetings one of the things I

757
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,660
talk about it's like wire you know who's

758
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,280
listening to these stations when it

759
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,680
seems that all these stations have

760
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,360
streams and phone access like I said and

761
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,919
the bishop told me this and these guys

762
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,510
said it's all before it's for the poor

763
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,530
and the elderly and their community the

764
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:18,050
shut-ins to people in hospitals yeah so

765
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,390
I know the process is not exactly easy

766
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,700
and our stricted windows when you can

767
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,040
apply for a permit but or a license

768
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,850
rather have any of the stations pursued

769
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,870
the low-power FM licensing problems no

770
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,120
that's something I was going to talk

771
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,970
about LPFM which could be its own

772
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,130
program was rising at the same time as

773
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:40,330
as you know like micro broadcasters

774
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:42,130
progressive people arts groups and that

775
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,380
inspired the FCC or the nope inspired

776
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,750
it's the right word to open windows of

777
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,870
LPFM licensing it was fought for years

778
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:52,540
by NPR of all things and the National

779
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:55,390
Association of Broadcasters in a in

780
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:58,570
short the licensing leaves out urban

781
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:00,430
areas so well pfm may have satisfied

782
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,470
some of those progressive micro

783
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,169
broadcasting pirates but a kind of left

784
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,540
urban pirates high and dry all the

785
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:10,060
station people I've talked with they're

786
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,259
like yeah you can come over and talk to

787
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,060
me could you tell me how I could get a

788
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,010
license I really want to get on the air

789
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,900
and then I tell them what their options

790
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:22,300
are and they're really very slim there

791
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:23,950
are in Queens there is an Asian LPFM in

792
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,050
Brooklyn they're supposed to be one I

793
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,600
don't think it's on the air yet but the

794
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:31,030
the rate of the guy from radio comedy he

795
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,310
said if we could just get one frequency

796
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,590
we could all be on the same station you

797
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,810
know they're they're not they don't feel

798
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,130
that they have to all have their own

799
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,380
station but they've appealed theirs and

800
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:44,230
there hasn't been a licensing LPFM

801
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,240
window since 2013 and when I talked to

802
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,210
Rosemary heralded the FCC she was like

803
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,950
well no we're not we don't plan to have

804
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,420
another one really we've already doubled

805
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:57,009
the amount of stations on the air I

806
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,900
actually first I want to say thanks sure

807
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:02,110
I'm really excited to turn on my radio

808
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,700
after probably a decade or more I had no

809
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,070
idea this is floating around out in

810
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,319
Flatbush Junction I do have one question

811
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,650
though are you concerned because I guess

812
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:15,190
the natural radio is naturally of this

813
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,780
ephemeral mode of communication that

814
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,940
you're archiving it that could be used

815
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,100
against the people that are broadcasting

816
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,950
in the case yeah well it certainly has

817
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,420
caused a few sleepless nights but I feel

818
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,339
it's a really important story to be

819
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,380
covered and what I've been hearing since

820
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,820
I released the map and I must stress

821
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,010
that there is no secret information that

822
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,750
I'm putting out that is anyone who can

823
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,540
listen to the radio can hear any of

824
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,450
these stations anytime

825
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:45,890
so the response I'm getting is that I

826
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,299
did these are incredible I didn't know

827
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,490
they were there I couldn't see why these

828
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,940
really served the community so I'm you I

829
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,609
am approaching it as a journalist but

830
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,960
I'm hoping that it will get the message

831
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:02,900
out that these are really important to

832
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,940
the community so very interesting you

833
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,800
said you've suggested that you've talked

834
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,360
been talking with FCC people to get

835
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,100
there sort of side of things I was

836
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,540
wondering could you tell us a little bit

837
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,580
about the mindset of where they're

838
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,440
coming from what they're thinking are

839
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,810
the New York area FCC people getting

840
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,090
pressure from the federal from

841
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,100
headquarters to do to crack down more

842
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,240
are their memos floating around that say

843
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,520
you know we need to get rid of some of

844
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,649
these stations or could you give us a

845
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,250
little more flavor yeah yeah definitely

846
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,620
and I did you know I did have some

847
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,320
things for this and they are a lot of

848
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:40,040
them are on the site since Trump and

849
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,840
Anja PI have come in they said are we

850
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,460
have a new priority which was really

851
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,000
sort of under played during the Obama

852
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,320
years when the FCC chief thenns wrote

853
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,690
this letter and it's on a really

854
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,770
interesting site called DIY media net

855
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:56,030
John Anderson and wheeler was like well

856
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,020
you know there's really not much we can

857
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,760
do we're going to work with the

858
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,100
communities to try to get this to stop

859
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,080
but once a July and Trump came in

860
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,960
they're like we are cracking down we are

861
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:10,940
sending a message so they are putting

862
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,350
pressure on on the local field office

863
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,810
but from what I've heard there are two

864
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:18,850
guys that chased down all the complaints

865
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:20,840
and Joseph I'm the guy from radio comedy

866
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,520
he said those actually they're very

867
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,870
polite they knock on the door they say

868
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,460
we understand your broadcasting would

869
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,810
you please take down your antenna and

870
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,740
they're like we're not broadcasting and

871
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:33,340
they're like yeah you are there's

872
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:36,770
something new called the pirate act

873
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,930
preventing interfering radio abuse

874
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,060
through enforcement something like that

875
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,100
which unfortunately has just passed the

876
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,740
house and it will essentially try to

877
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,400
shorten the enforcement window because

878
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,899
now there's a complaint they they

879
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,270
triangulate and find where the station

880
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,890
is they send and then you

881
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,630
saying you shouldn't be on this please

882
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,580
get off the air and if they do there's

883
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,860
no penalty if they remain on the air

884
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:03,290
they get something called an nal notice

885
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,260
of assess liability you owe us $10,000

886
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:09,290
now they're bringing up the fines up to

887
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,480
two million on this legislation and

888
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:13,369
they're gonna have to mandated sweeps a

889
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,710
year so there's a lot of activity going

890
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:20,780
on to try to crack down there's another

891
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:24,730
commissioner O'Reily that is anti pirate

892
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:27,140
and I'm just gonna show very briefly

893
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:29,150
when this came out there was a New

894
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,270
Yorker article and Commissioner O'Reilly

895
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,730
who is the most of adamant anti park I

896
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,070
New Yorker article tries to paint pretty

897
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,390
picture of pirate radio while barely

898
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:42,860
discussing the illegal practice harms so

899
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:45,410
you know they're they are trying to

900
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,270
down but I would I read between lines is

901
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,730
that they're trying to scare people they

902
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,380
realize that it's so vast that they

903
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,390
can't take them all off but they're

904
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,190
trying to send a message well with the

905
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,600
big farms most stations just ignore them

906
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,670
when they get these letters they stay on

907
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,759
the air their antenna gets taken down

908
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,350
they wait a few months and they get a

909
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,500
new one and they put it back up at least

910
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,549
that's what's been happening until now

911
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,830
are you seeing any difference in

912
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:12,020
enforcement between stations that accept

913
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,090
advertising and stations that don't no

914
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,890
I'm not seeing any and also I think to

915
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:18,920
answer your question when I would spoke

916
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,270
to rosemary Halliday FC I said well you

917
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,430
know what what I'm hearing is that

918
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,930
there's a lot of cultural importance to

919
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,819
these stations in the community and

920
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,129
they're basically what we don't care

921
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,930
we're just here to enforce the law and

922
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,410
they get pressure from the state

923
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:36,440
broadcasting associations - you said you

924
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:38,750
had photos of transmitters I have an

925
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,300
antenna photo but I'm going to show one

926
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,010
more another tweet there are Tim Wu

927
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,780
tweeted could there be a worse waste of

928
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,670
federal resources than going after

929
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,590
pirate radio stations run by immigrants

930
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,940
in Brooklyn hey if you see how about

931
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,710
actually stopping River calls and then

932
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,619
there was this I answered some questions

933
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,510
for a radio Inc David Glenn should be

934
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:58,790
prosecuted for supporting illegal

935
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,470
activity so see I sort of get it from

936
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,900
both sides it's like am i hurting them I

937
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,160
don't think so anyway it sounds like

938
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,839
time's up I do

939
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:12,529
two more minutes yes pictures of

940
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:14,599
antennas that's my radio there here's

941
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:21,109
just a typical antenna walking down the

942
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:24,319
street and and this is an amazing

943
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:27,339
honking antenna on top of a small church

944
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,450
which I cut out of the picture and

945
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:30,920
that's one of the third one of the few

946
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,118
stations that don't have a buy president

947
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,289
their preacher comes on every night

948
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,430
talks to his flock stuff like that

949
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:39,680
another thing I was going to say about

950
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,899
Jay route radio is they were busted a

951
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,078
couple years back before they went on a

952
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,940
nine to five point one and I have seen

953
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,400
forums in what they call the Torah

954
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,200
community it's like you know God says

955
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,030
it's okay for them to be on the air no

956
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,220
God says it's brown you know and there's

957
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,799
a lot of accusations and this is also in

958
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,589
the Haitian community that groups within

959
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:02,480
the community are knocking on each other

960
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:04,430

radio station unfortunately nobody else

974
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:43,080
