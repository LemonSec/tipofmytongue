1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm gyrus I'm here to talk to you about

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,149
Mozilla's internet health report I have

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,980
I have three cats

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,200
this is inky blinky and Clyde they're

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,450
very good cats except for blinky blinky

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
is not very good at being a cat or very

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,448
smart but she has a good heart

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,390
so that's think that's important this is

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,279
me and Clyde playing monster hunter so

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,710
you can find me online at gyrus Kahn I'm

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:34,769
Jerez Kahn basically everywhere so

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:40,800
Twitter Instagram Xbox Live PlayStation

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,570
Network if you have very bad taste in

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,250
music you might also have heard my music

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,850
it's not very good I can't recommend it

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,910
but it was mentioned by jwz so some of

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,649
you may have read about it I did a kind

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,510
of a protest at a show that I was

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,809
playing so that was a whole thing was

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,390
pretty good I work for Mozilla probably

21
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,510
you know it we make Firefox we have

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,580
pocket a bunch of other stuff too I work

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,070
for the Mozilla Foundation which is the

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,479
nonprofit arm of Mozilla it owns the

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,850
Mozilla Corporation that makes Firefox

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,560
and everything else and and part of what

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,780
the Mozilla Foundation tries to do is

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,950
look at ways that we can make the

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,840
internet better that we can make it

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,369
safer we can make it more engaging more

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,799
inclusive everything

32
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,810
Mozilla works on a there's a Mozilla

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,170
manifesto with a number of principles

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,720
about why Mozilla operates the way that

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,950
it does and it's not open source just

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,289
because it's a good idea and makes good

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,180
software but also because we're trying

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,530
to make things better overall so these

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,170
are some of the the principles that

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,060
Mozilla operates under and I'm gonna

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,159
talk just for a few seconds about some

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,479
of the other stuff Missoula is doing not

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,979
to sell you on Mozilla but just to give

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,429
you some context for why we're doing the

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,920
infinite health report and what it means

46
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,540
so we put a lot of resources into not

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,820
just our own projects but in projects by

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,250
other people to try and uplift work

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,750
other people are doing right now where

50
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,520
there's a application process open for

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,790
quarter million dollars towards artists

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,530
who are making art exploring AI

53
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,019
it's still open you can apply for it we

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,730
also do fellowships last year we did

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,220
over a million dollars in fellowships

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,130
for open web activists tech policy

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,359
professionals people who were doing work

58
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,000
that is useful and and should be seen by

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,260
more people so if you are doing

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,450
interesting work head to the Mozilla

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,399
Foundation website maybe we can give you

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,280
a lot of money that'd be great

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,200
we also do a bit of consumer advocacy so

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,670
one of the projects we had at the end of

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,250
last year was called privacy not

66
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,820
included where we took a bunch of

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,950
popular toys that were smart toys that

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,769
were connected and we ran them through

69
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,380
security audits to try and figure out

70
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,080
what could go wrong if this toy got

71
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,570
hacked what could go wrong I chose this

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,670
one because I think this cat is

73
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,739
definitely a Fed like like like I mean

74
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,670
look look at those eyes those are dead

75
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,470
inside those are like shark eyes so this

76
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,059
is like an audit of this of this real

77
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,800
toy called pet cute play and and you

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,630
know says there's a camera there's a mic

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,560
attraction location you have to have an

80
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:30,000
account it does have privacy controls so

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:33,060
this work is to to look at health of the

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,520
internet a bit differently when Mozilla

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,670
started going deeper into this advocacy

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,040
kind of work there was kind of a

85
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,359
realization that we've been approaching

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,980
it the wrong way we've been spending our

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,850
time telling people to install VPNs and

88
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,500
use tor and and worried about IOT and

89
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,299
then we did a survey and some research

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,850
and realized most people have no idea

91
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,680
what these things are and really what

92
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,530
you have to say is is your pet toys

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,100
spying on you and the answer is maybe

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:10,820
which is weird but that's that's life in

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:12,480
the year 2018 so okay so in the 60s

96
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,160
environmentalists had a bit of a problem

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,899
in that there were all of these issues

98
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,810
that were really really important that

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,728
they were trying to talk about that they

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,800
didn't know how to get traction on you

101
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,580
know he had holes in the ozone layer he

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,550
had renewable energy animal

103
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,729
all of these things that were being

104
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,849
discussed and looked at individually and

105
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,469
at some point it coalesced around a

106
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,360
movement an environmental movement so

107
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,580
these things it's not about saving the

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,900
whales it's not about deforestation it's

109
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,449
not about the ozone layer it's about all

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,549
of these things when put together create

111
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,039
stress on this global system the system

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,229
of systems we call the environment and

113
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,780
it can maybe support more stress in one

114
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,909
place than another but it's a full

115
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,229
system and we need to look at it as an

116
00:04:54,909 --> 00:05:01,719
ecosystem and and it was effective so

117
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:04,030
laws were changed green industries were

118
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:05,500
created and now we all kind of generally

119
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,789
understand that the environment means

120
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,659
something when we talk about the health

121
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:11,800
of the environment it means something

122
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:14,560
weird a similar place now with the

123
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,909
internet so that it over there by the

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,830
way this is all the websites that can

125
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:21,819
only use Internet Explorer six that are

126
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,090
still around but the Internet has become

127
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,770
our environment we have apps to help us

128
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,560
with everything with eating walking

129
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,299
driving growing food having sex having a

130
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,690
baby not having a baby building widgets

131
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,340
running a city and the Internet of

132
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,130
Things is going to have 20 billion

133
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,909
devices on it by 2020 they're all going

134
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:47,110
to be collecting data and and they're of

135
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:48,490
questionable security so the stakes are

136
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,169
different now the Internet is our

137
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,180
environment and how healthy it is or

138
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,000
isn't has a direct impact on our

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:59,919
happiness our privacy our pocketbooks

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,259
everything so we are trying to frame the

141
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,789
internet conversation differently it's

142
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,509
not about packet latency it's not about

143
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:09,669
ipv6 uptake it's not about harassment

144
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,139
it's about internet health and all of

145
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,279
these things play a part it's an

146
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,740
environment it's a network of networks

147
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,379
and it can absorb more stress on some

148
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,419
places than others but we can't look at

149
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,279
these things in isolation anymore so

150
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,840
that brings us to the Internet Health

151
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:28,569
Report there are a lot of reports about

152
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,979
the internet about the way that it works

153
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,440
in different countries levels of

154
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,330
censorship level of network penetration

155
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,460
we're trying to do something a bit

156
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,688
different in that it is about the human

157
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,688
experience

158
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:44,289
the internet so we're trying to look at

159
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:46,449
it from the level of the Internet is a

160
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,549
network but at the end of all these data

161
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,349
points are people the Internet is built

162
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:53,258
so that people can use it so what is it

163
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,409
doing for people is it useful for people

164
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:58,569
and if the system isn't healthy if it's

165
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:01,209
unhealthy can you have healthy

166
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:04,209
communities built on the system that's

167
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:07,529
unhealthy so we worked with researchers

168
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:09,969
digital rights activists our community

169
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:12,729
Brando's on Twitter anyone who wanted to

170
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:15,149
help open-source project to look at from

171
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:20,349
a human perspective how the Internet is

172
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:22,599
so we looked at five issues that after

173
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:27,128
research we felt like were the best

174
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:30,308
categories for discussing in we also had

175
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:32,259
three spotlight stories that that were

176
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,279
issues that were extremely pressing that

177
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,259
maybe covered a couple of these

178
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:40,209
different categories one being

179
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:43,269
centralization how big Internet

180
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,519
companies are getting and how it creates

181
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,969
unhealthy conditions for innovators

182
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,989
smaller populations trying to get online

183
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:55,269
fake news and looking at it for not just

184
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:57,789
from like a state propaganda point of

185
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:00,699
view but what is the impact Fitness is

186
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,239
having on people on the Internet and why

187
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,909
is it like why does it work and the

188
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:09,549
third is IOT which as mentioned is you

189
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,979
know we're adding more devices we're not

190
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,449
adding more security probably that's not

191
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,949
going to work out well for us so I'm

192
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,289
going to talk a bit about some of the

193
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,909
things in each of these each of these

194
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,349
categories that we looked at so the

195
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:27,219
first category is privacy and security

196
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,519
these are some of the stories that we

197
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,169
had we have a problem with security in

198
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,849
that in that the core business models of

199
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,279
the Internet depend on knowing as much

200
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,500
as possible about everyone and then

201
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,929
analyzing repackaging and selling that

202
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,250
information

203
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,849
20:17 was really bad idea for security

204
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,380
there were breaches everywhere Equifax

205
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,730
Yahoo announced that over a billion

206
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,769
accounts have been breached I didn't

207
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,579
even know there were a billion yeah

208
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:56,339
accounts but uber you know it was it was

209
00:08:53,579 --> 00:09:02,008
everywhere wanna cry happened so it was

210
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:04,170
a bad year for security overall one of

211
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,730
our stories here is about Remy Rauf he's

212
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,488
an Egyptian technologist he was working

213
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,429
out of Lebanon he's a member of the Tor

214
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:13,470
Board of Directors and he was working in

215
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:16,470
the Egyptian initiative for personal

216
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,509
rights which is an NGO when they get a

217
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,160
call from a journalist about a press

218
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:23,160
conference that they were going to be

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,600
having soon they hadn't planned the best

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,629
press conference so this was this was

221
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,759
news and upon investigation that looked

222
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,009
they found that hundreds of emails had

223
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,679
been sent out in the organization's name

224
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,540
inviting journalists activists civil

225
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,699
society groups to a press conference

226
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,599
that they never arranged about a draft

227
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:46,229
law in Egypt that would effectively ban

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,199
nongovernmental organizations the law

229
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,170
passed it's a disaster Human Rights

230
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:53,459
Watch says the law was in unprecedented

231
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,829
levels of repression and will

232
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,628
criminalize the work of many NGOs making

233
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,618
it impossible for them to function

234
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:04,319
independently and as part of the rollout

235
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:06,240
for this law a lot of NGOs found

236
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:08,399
themselves under a reasonably

237
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,889
sophisticated technical and social

238
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,240
attacks there was a paper published on

239
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:17,759
this in along with the citizen lab from

240
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,509
from U of T the scale of attacks was

241
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:25,499
called the Nile fish but these are some

242
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:27,360
of the challenges facing people when

243
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,339
they are trying to do activist work when

244
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,839
they are trying to work on Internet

245
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:37,350
health this is a classic one of my

246
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,009
favorites so this is from a leak of 10

247
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,449
million passwords wpengine took one of

248
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,169
the 10 million password leaks that were

249
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,329
floating around

250
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:47,279
put together top common use passwords

251
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:50,939
I'm sure none of us would use any of

252
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,209
these of course but but really it shows

253
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:58,740
how bad passwords are as a form of

254
00:10:54,209 --> 00:11:00,569
security and how even now one two three

255
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,429
four five six people are like oh that's

256
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,270
that's a good idea that's that's what I

257
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,850
should use

258
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,090
my password so you know these are live

259
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,620
these are real it was estimated by the

260
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,980
the researcher that put this together

261
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:20,760
that 16 out of a thousand passwords

262
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:23,760
could be guessed using the top 10 so the

263
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,780
next topic we did was openness one of

264
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,330
the great things about the Internet is

265
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,569
you don't need permission to build for

266
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,530
it

267
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:34,080
there's permissionless innovation and

268
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:36,270
the idea of that openness is built into

269
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,740
the architecture of the Internet you

270
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,079
know to a level where now we're trying

271
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,050
to kind of make more security into the

272
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,110
fundamental protocols but that openness

273
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,280
of the Internet is a radical concept it

274
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,720
was a radical concept when it was

275
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,150
invented and it's constantly at risk

276
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,260
governments block mobile apps shut down

277
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,970
the internet it will copyright laws as

278
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,540
mentioned in one of the sessions earlier

279
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:06,390
are a real threat to free speech

280
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:09,689
so how open the Internet is is a good

281
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:13,730
bellwether for for how healthy it is in

282
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:16,710
a lot of places the this is a chart for

283
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,480
official justifications for government

284
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,220
shutdowns of the Internet so this is

285
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,580
when a government has intervened and

286
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,760
either you know at the border or with

287
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,910
state ISPs or with privatized SPS forced

288
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,700
shutdowns of Internet services you can

289
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:37,110
see in 2017 the national security

290
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,740
justification is about twice as big as

291
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,110
it was

292
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,900
the year before along with stopping

293
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,630
rumors and dissemination of legal

294
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,540
content the majority of shutdowns last

295
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,040
year occurred in Asia and Africa with

296
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,880
the idea that they were preventative

297
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,069
responses to conflicts in some places

298
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,570
these shutdowns lasted hours in some

299
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:02,820
places they lasted months and minorities

300
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,380
are disproportionately at the end of

301
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,990
these whether that's a death nick or

302
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,520
linguistic minority whether that's

303
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,400
people who don't have access to higher

304
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,990
tier services shut down to

305
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,829
disproportionately affect the

306
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,080
marginalized the most

307
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,960
and obviously they're bad for the

308
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,899
internet they contribute to the

309
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,190
balkanization of the Internet and we

310
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,390
need better legal frameworks for when

311
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,860
something happens that there is a

312
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,449
justification that we need to impact

313
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,830
Internet traffic we need to have a

314
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,149
framework for it we need to be able to

315
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,920
examine it and hold it up to the light

316
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,320
and say you know that we think we think

317
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,360
this is important and this frameworks

318
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,520
don't really exist yet

319
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,540
the next category we looked at is

320
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,860
Digital Inclusion so that's who's online

321
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,420
about half the world's population is

322
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,980
online now and like with the shutdown's

323
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,839
the the digital divide is greater for

324
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:02,220
marginalized populations so rural

325
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:06,450
communities low incomes women minorities

326
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,100
have worse access are connected later

327
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:13,750
and have fewer accesses to the same

328
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:17,230
services once they're online so the

329
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,450
internet is great if you're on it so we

330
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,150
need to look at who's on it is it safe

331
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,550
to be on it and and and what the impact

332
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,430
of that is one of the stories that we

333
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,560
did is about the cyber civil rights

334
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,810
initiative which is a helpline for

335
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,369
victims of revenge porn which is when

336
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,369
someone takes her intimate images and

337
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,209
shares them without your knowledge or

338
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,370
consent this is a big problem not just

339
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,430
this but harassment in general is a big

340
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,220
problem because it's kicking people off

341
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,719
the internet if people are going offline

342
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,540
they're saying you know what I can't I

343
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,890
can't do this and this is a speech issue

344
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,779
in addition to a safety issue because

345
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,100
the people who aren't online anymore

346
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:04,660
can't participate in the digital Commons

347
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:10,270
there was a Supreme Court ruling last

348
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:12,339
year about about a law that prevented

349
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:16,420
convicted sex offenders from accessing

350
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:18,430
using social networking websites and it

351
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,819
was struck down in a unanimous ruling

352
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,989
and I'm gonna put a quote up here that I

353
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,990
think is really really important

354
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,589
while in the past there may have been

355
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,149
difficulty in identifying the most

356
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,220
important places for the exchange of

357
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,560
views today the answer is clear it is

358
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,839
cyberspace the vast democratic forms of

359
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,949
the internet in general and social media

360
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:44,160
in particular so being able to be on

361
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:46,740
social media is a speech issue being

362
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,170
able to access these services and do so

363
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,579
without getting doxed without getting

364
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,219
harassed without getting threats without

365
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,819
having the address of your kids school

366
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,889
posted

367
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,110
that's a speech issue and when people

368
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,680
are getting kicked off line that's a

369
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,779
problem um a common argument against

370
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,209
this is that things like the First

371
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,860
Amendment don't apply to private actors

372
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:11,310
they're intended to restrict the

373
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,240
government's actions and while that is

374
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,649
true the right still exists you don't

375
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,040
get rights from governments you get

376
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:23,550
rights because you have rights and when

377
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,399
we started this whole internet modern

378
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,750
internet thing I mean the general

379
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,970
feeling was we don't want the

380
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,949
government's online right this is from

381
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,449
JP Barlow's declaration of the

382
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:38,010
independence of cyberspace is the

383
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:42,810
opening line opening lines of it so the

384
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,970
idea that that threats to speech from

385
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,279
private actors or from company are not

386
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,540
actually an infringement of rights is a

387
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,689
really radical retelling of the story of

388
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:58,439
what the politics of the Internet have

389
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:03,149
always been and and it's not really

390
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:06,299
super accurate the Internet is a

391
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,849
community that we are building and if we

392
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:11,849
allow people to chase other people off

393
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,668
of it that's a speech issue as much as

394
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,109
if we are passing a laws preventing them

395
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:17,160
from being on it the only difference is

396
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,409
it's not the government that's shutting

397
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,240
down your right to free speech

398
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,069
everyone knows the phrase my right to

399
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,970
swing my fist ends where your nose

400
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,369
begins and we do a lot of talking here

401
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,559
in other spaces and everywhere about

402
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,739
swinging our fists and not so much about

403
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,340
where people's noses are and as someone

404
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,100
with the big nose I I feel personally

405
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:43,639
affronted by this but we don't we don't

406
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:46,969
really talk about okay so so where does

407
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,580
your right to free speech and when it

408
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,640
comes to my right to be safe to not be

409
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,740
doxed to not be threatened and this is

410
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,600
something that we really need to grapple

411
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:01,370
with because we haven't done it yet web

412
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,469
literacy is the next category that we

413
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:09,169
looked at this is complicated it you

414
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,930
need a lot of skills to use the Internet

415
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,410
a lot of technical skills and a lot of

416
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,180
social skills we did a study Missoula

417
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:21,350
dis did a study I was a one-year

418
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,860
research project in in Kenya where we

419
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,810
created a digital skills observatory and

420
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,250
this is this was a proper study there

421
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,710
were researchers who the control group

422
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,870
and it was to look at the impact of

423
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,710
digital skills on people's lives

424
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,239
so it was a study cohort of 150

425
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,100
first-time smartphone users they'd never

426
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,280
had a smartphone before people between

427
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,770
the ages of 18 and 35 living in urban

428
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,550
rural areas that earned less than five

429
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,550
dollars a day and it turned out they

430
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,290
needed 53 skills in order to use the

431
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,730
Internet in a way that was safe that

432
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:00,379
improved their lives that made it better

433
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,710
and that's like that's a wild number and

434
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,930
I think that I think that in the West

435
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,150
especially we have this idea that that

436
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,460
we know how the internet works that

437
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,020
there are such things as digital natives

438
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,510
if you put a baby in front of an iPad

439
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,940
they'll know how to use the Internet and

440
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:21,920
we do have a lot of intuitive interfaces

441
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,870
and those are important but I think that

442
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,110
I think that having spent so much time

443
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,719
with the Internet like most of us in the

444
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,939
room we assume that that what we've

445
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,400
learned to be true is is obvious we know

446
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,290
that if we get an email from John Q

447
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,020
billionaire offering to transfer us

448
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,060
money or some print somewhere that like

449
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,299
probably probably there's no billionaire

450
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,158
off

451
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,129
to transfer us money that's that's it's

452
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,629
not a good idea but for someone who's

453
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:49,488
coming up to the internet now you mean

454
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:52,580
they go on Twitter the Pope is on

455
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:55,429
Twitter Donald Trump is on Twitter Elon

456
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,799
Musk an actual billionaire is on Twitter

457
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,049
calling people names right like like

458
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,908
this is real life so so when someone

459
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,158
goes online now they're a new user to

460
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:07,249
the Internet they see Elon Musk like

461
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,840
like shitposting and and then they get

462
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:11,629
an email from some other billionaire

463
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,820
that's not a crazy idea it's not crazy

464
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:18,709
that a billionaire could be talking to

465
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,480
you directly and and if you want any

466
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,850
more proof that we are not immune to

467
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,309
this in the West all we need to do is is

468
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,418
look at the issue of fake news right

469
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:31,879
which is kind of like the the scam email

470
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:36,049
but for your irrelevance that you can't

471
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:38,840
talk to anymore so one of the things

472
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,269
about about the fake news issue that

473
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,238
happened around the election last year

474
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:47,179
or two years ago there was obviously a

475
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:50,299
state propaganda element to it that

476
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,980
everyone knows about but prior to the

477
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,049
election even a number of journalists

478
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,519
had had done research into okay where

479
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:57,049
these stories coming from some are

480
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,730
obviously coming from state propaganda

481
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,158
but they're not all coming from them

482
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,519
where they're coming from and the answer

483
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,039
was was really surprising

484
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:12,220
this is vellus in macedonia population

485
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:15,619
43,000 and responsible for hundreds of

486
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:19,820
fake news sites like literally hundreds

487
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:23,769
of fake news sites the reason that this

488
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,119
happened is because people found in this

489
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:27,919
economically depressed area where the

490
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,129
average monthly income is between four

491
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,739
and five hundred dollars u.s. that when

492
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:36,019
they would post stories with you know

493
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,789
wild headlines to Facebook to Twitter

494
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:40,100
people would click on them and they

495
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,139
would get advertising revenue so they

496
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,059
started making more stories they made

497
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:47,418
got more advertising revenue they

498
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:50,869
started buying ads for it and soon there

499
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:54,680
was an economy in this in this very tiny

500
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:56,360
town to create fake news and because

501
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,150
were making Bank from and some people

502
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,399
were making $10,000 us a month which is

503
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,490
a lot of money for anyone let alone

504
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,110
someone who lives in a place where like

505
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:11,060
jobs are scarce and and money more so

506
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,949
the reason that a lot of these fake news

507
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,690
sites ended up being on one side of the

508
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,310
political spectrum is because they

509
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,470
performed better that's it people

510
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:23,659
collect ads paid more locals were

511
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:26,060
written so the impact that something

512
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,590
like this has on the internet on our

513
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,679
ability to trust what we see on the

514
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,659
internet obviously is huge not even

515
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,170
counting the the political implications

516
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,860
of it but can when you see something on

517
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,590
the Internet

518
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,429
do you have the skills to know if it's

519
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,730
true or not

520
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:48,370
and how long did it take you to develop

521
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:51,890
them it's a big challenge

522
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:55,270
decentralization is the is the last

523
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:58,310
category that we looked at so this is

524
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,110
you know people have talked about maybe

525
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,110
we should break up big tech companies

526
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,990
maybe it's not great a Facebook does

527
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,979
everything for you

528
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:12,680
probably that's true but the fact that

529
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,450
these services are becoming so tightly

530
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,640
net is a is a is a huge huge problem pop

531
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,010
quiz

532
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,800
what social media companies or what

533
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,350
companies have the most users on their

534
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:33,590
social media networks top three yell it

535
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:37,189
out if you have an idea Facebook WeChat

536
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:41,510
absolutely so 10 cent which owns WeChat

537
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,370
is the number two social media company

538
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:48,760
just behind Facebook Facebook has

539
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:54,610
whatsapp messenger Instagram but 10 cent

540
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:57,620
they're like their user rate is is huge

541
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,929
who here knows about WeChat is familiar

542
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,050
with WeChat all right so quite a few of

543
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,460
you so one thing I think is that's

544
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:07,820
really interesting about WeChat is how

545
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:12,680
they've managed to make QR codes

546
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:15,470
like a like a fundamental part of social

547
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,600
interactions I like that they made them

548
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,980
cute so these are my QR codes from

549
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,080
WeChat if you're not familiar with

550
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,750
WeChat you have the ability to take a

551
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,990
photo of a QR code and go to a website

552
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,990
or load an app and people use it to send

553
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,030
money so if I am it if I'm running a

554
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,430
coffee shop I can put my QR code up and

555
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,860
instead of giving me money you can take

556
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,320
a photo of my QR code and send me 4

557
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,409
bucks for my coffee not for your coffee

558
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,540
so we chat makes it you know cute and

559
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,460
cool and you know I can print these and

560
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:50,530
have them on stickers people get

561
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:54,350
temporary tattoos it's pretty cool and

562
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:58,480
and in an increasingly cashless society

563
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:01,070
in larger cities the homeless are

564
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,520
laminating their QR codes and keeping

565
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,530
them out that way they can get money too

566
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:12,560
when people are carrying around less

567
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:15,320
cash WeChat has an 80 to 90% weekly

568
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,370
penetration rate among active Internet

569
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,669
users in in China like 9 out of 10

570
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,100
people that's a lot of people if you

571
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:27,410
don't know WeChat it's hard to to

572
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,139
understand the scale of it it is to a

573
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,600
lot of people the whole internet you

574
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,050
don't need to leave it you can do almost

575
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,790
anything on it you can send money to

576
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,740
friends you can book a doctor's

577
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:45,440
appointment apply for a visa donate to

578
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:48,020
charities you can't transfer 6.41 around

579
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,490
the Tiananmen Square massacre there's a

580
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,570
lot of things you can't do on it so we

581
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,490
chad is becoming more and more

582
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,560
integrated into people's lives

583
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:02,200
WeChat is becoming more and more an

584
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:05,360
offline thing as well as an online thing

585
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,570
and the top left here is a is a gas

586
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,570
station it's a WeChat gas station you

587
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:14,750
drive in it scans your license plate it

588
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,730
loads your preferences it knows what

589
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,010
kind of gas that you want so you just

590
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,910
pull up everything's ready someone pumps

591
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,879
your gas and you

592
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:26,150
and it charges your WeChat account

593
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:29,920
pretty cool it's pretty fast in the left

594
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:34,280
top left corner is a screenshot of a of

595
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,770
a facial recognition program that's

596
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,889
being rolled out into WeChat because we

597
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,950
chat is being used now in pilot programs

598
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,200
as official government ID so instead of

599
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,920
a social security card our social credit

600
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,970
card you have your WeChat so you go to a

601
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,060
government office you go to a hospital

602
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,160
you show your WeChat ID and you get it

603
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,870
to facial to writing as your face and

604
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:02,330
that counts as government ID the big

605
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:06,189
image in the middle here is an actual

606
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:12,649
image from from chinese state media

607
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:16,040
because the I mean this is this is guy

608
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,480
if it didn't exist and I made it up no

609
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,629
one would believe they'd be like that's

610
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,960
that's that's ridiculous so they're

611
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:27,380
using facial recognition and and machine

612
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,570
learning to find jaywalkers if you

613
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,040
jaywalk at certain intersections your

614
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:36,500
face goes up on a website of jaywalkers

615
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,860
and now that people have their WeChat

616
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,770
account connected you can get an

617
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,290
automatic fine when you jaywalk so you

618
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,990
jaywalk it scans your face your face is

619
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,280
connected to WeChat you get you which

620
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,220
has connected to your bank account or

621
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,820
your we here we pay account and and you

622
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,250
get a fine automatically within 10

623
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,590
months of deployment over 13,000

624
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:05,060
jaywalkers had had their faces displayed

625
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,919
on LED our LCD screens next to the next

626
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,610
to the intersection to shame people who

627
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:14,230
who were jaywalking so when we look at

628
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:18,889
what centralization means it's not just

629
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:22,010
Google as using my emails to to you know

630
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:25,310
serve me better ads like the the future

631
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,080
of centralization is is you know a black

632
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,720
mirror episode that got cut for being

633
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,649
too unrealistic

634
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,770
all of this is getting tied into the the

635
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,930
pilot and rollout of the Chinese social

636
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,970
credit system if you're not familiar

637
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,440
with it it's a system that China is

638
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,800
hoping to roll out to all citizens by

639
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,510
2020 where you have a credit score that

640
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,490
is your social credit score so it

641
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:53,750
includes financial things same as you

642
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,010
your credit score here but also how well

643
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,690
you are participating and contributing

644
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:02,860
to society so higher credit score means

645
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:06,890
you're you're a better citizen basically

646
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:09,469
the exact magic juice of the credit

647
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,980
score is not known and is still in pilot

648
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:15,050
so some of these will get added some of

649
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,190
them will get removed but on the left

650
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,889
you can see some of the factors for

651
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:22,220
credit scores such as do you pay your

652
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,890
traffic fines on time do you spread

653
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,600
online rumors what do you buy do you buy

654
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,520
do you play too many video games if you

655
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,860
play over a certain amount of hours that

656
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,960
can lower your score on the right are

657
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,929
some of the privileges you can get for

658
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,790
having a good social credit score so at

659
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,790
the lower ones you can you can get a

660
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:43,460
loan to do online shopping you rent the

661
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:47,960
car without deposit and up at the top

662
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:51,140
you can get a fast tracked visa you can

663
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,750
get access to social groups online that

664
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,790
are women only or men get access I

665
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,980
should say to the women only groups as a

666
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:02,720
kind of perk my my favorite of the

667
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,850
factors here at the bottom is the

668
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,950
supreme people's courts list of

669
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,050
dishonest people which is an actual

670
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,510
thing that the the Chinese Supreme Court

671
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:13,790
publishes the most recent list has eight

672
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,200
point eight million names on it so these

673
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,840
are people who have defaulted on loans

674
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,050
who have been charged with you know

675
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,870
perjury or

676
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:29,030
similar crimes if you're on this list

677
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,219
life is a lot harder for you people on

678
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,580
this list have been prevented from

679
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,150
buying plane tickets eight point seven

680
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,389
million airline tickets have been

681
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,070
declined

682
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,390
because people were on this list three

683
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,560
point four million high speed rail

684
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,980
tickets

685
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,899
one person on this list was fined

686
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,880
$15,000 for travelling on a first-class

687
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,070
flight they weren't allowed to because

688
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,890
they were on the list and another went

689
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,800
had plastic surgery to try and avoid the

690
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:00,590
facial recognition it did not work a

691
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,159
hundred and seventy thousand people have

692
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:10,000
been denied executive job positions

693
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:14,480
because they are on this list so it's

694
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,370
it's a I mean it's again it's if it

695
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,650
didn't exist and we made it up people be

696
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,979
like oh that's that's ridiculous if you

697
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:24,110
call someone who is on this list

698
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,880
depending on how bad their offense is

699
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,290
you might get a phone message before

700
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,390
they pick up saying the person you're

701
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:33,409
talking to isn't paying their debts

702
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,150
please convince them to do so so all of

703
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:39,080
this is getting integrated now with the

704
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:41,360
Social Credit System my favorite

705
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,189
actually is not the Supreme Court's

706
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,399
listeners songs people my favorite

707
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:50,840
factor of the credit score is his

708
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:54,740
Counter Strike so Counter Strike go in

709
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,230
China is hooked up to your official ID

710
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:01,400
if you want to play it you have to

711
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:03,410
connect it if you use aimbots your score

712
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,680
gets lowered it impacts your social

713
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:08,720
credit score this is the the VP who

714
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,090
brought countess correct go to China

715
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:17,050
saying proudly it's the worst punishment

716
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:20,840
in history and he's probably not wrong

717
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:25,399
so so to kind of like roll this back a

718
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,800
bit this means that if you are using an

719
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,430
aimbot when you play Counter Strike you

720
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,050
might not get approved for a home loan

721
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:36,140
you might not be able to rent a car you

722
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:39,680
might not be able to fly to go to go on

723
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:44,300
vacation this is what centralization

724
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:47,710
looks like people with low ratings

725
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,330
have can have slower internet speeds

726
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,580
their speeds can get throttled

727
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,520
restricted access to restaurants

728
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,970
nightclubs restricted access

729
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,500
for luxury travel it impacts your rental

730
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,020
applications ability to get a loan

731
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,960
Social Security benefits people with low

732
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:09,590
scores have limited ability to get hired

733
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:14,059
even dating apps will show people's

734
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:15,529
scores if they have good scores which is

735
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,470
a subtle effect but what we're really

736
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:20,600
looking at now is the way that you talk

737
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,179
online the way you play games online is

738
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,428
going to impact who you meet who you

739
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:30,470
talk to where you can go the jobs that

740
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:36,799
you can have everything it and where you

741
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:38,390
can go to school so obviously when we

742
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,710
look at the West in a tower

743
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:47,000
centralization we need to be tougher

744
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:50,120
about it because this is where we could

745
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,549
end up and that's not like I mean this

746
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,620
isn't science fiction the difference is

747
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:56,539
that it's not going to be coming from

748
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,010
the state it's going to be coming from a

749
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:01,370
bunch of companies that have gotten

750
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:04,158
together and decided that well we want

751
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,000
to lower your insurance rates if you are

752
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,679
a good driver

753
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,859
so we're gonna hook up to the telemetry

754
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,379
of your car or some you know some auto

755
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:16,119
data collection site to see what you're

756
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:20,899
doing this is you know this could be us

757
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:24,409
so all of this to say it isn't about

758
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:26,388
WeChat it's not about China it's about

759
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:29,500
this system of systems we call the

760
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,690
Internet and how healthy it is or isn't

761
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,369
how healthy is the Internet it's not an

762
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,200
easy question to answer in some places

763
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:38,389
it's great there are some indicators

764
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,888
that look good access affordability

765
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,889
encryption all of those things are

766
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,849
moving in the right direction some

767
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,710
things are definitely moving in the

768
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:48,859
wrong direction the censorship online

769
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,310
harassment energy use the impact of

770
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:53,810
Bitcoin mining on energy use is

771
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,500
significant and is not going away it's

772
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:59,770
getting worse we need to pay attention

773
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:03,290
to the contractions that are happening

774
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,250
online tension between free speech and

775
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,660
harassment

776
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,720
technologies that have a lot of promise

777
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,970
like blockchain that are also being used

778
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:18,279
in ways that could be really really bad

779
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:22,629
for the entire planet we need to examine

780
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,570
how we can use the Internet in a way to

781
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:28,920
make everyone's lives better so part of

782
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,030
the work that we're doing at Mozilla is

783
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,160
we're trying to get as many people

784
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,870
involved in helping us figure out what

785
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:39,129
we should be looking at for the Internet

786
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:43,420
health report we have a workshop session

787
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:45,160
after next in the Paris room if you are

788
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,770
a person who works on these issues or is

789
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,120
interested in these issues or has hoped

790
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,480
someone would look into a particular

791
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,920
issue but no one has please come hang

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,580
understand we want to know our unknown

795
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,950
unknowns and we want to get people

796
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,790

809
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:45,190
presentation so I think we have some

810
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:49,930
time for Q&A hello hi so my question

811
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:52,930
relates to I wanted you to expound a

812
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,730
little bit on the whole right of the

813
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,620
fist and hitting your nose and what not

814
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:01,510
sure because we're talking about people

815
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:02,440
getting having their speech rights it

816
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,800
sounds like you're saying people are

817
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,510
having their speech rights limited or

818
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,420
you know but not by the government but

819
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,510
you know socially by other people who

820
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:17,580
appear to be exercising their speech

821
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:19,190
rights in some cases and so I

822
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,810
want to understand a little better like

823
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,610
if you say that people who wear plaid

824
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,380
shirts should be punched in the face and

825
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,330
you know I'm wearing a plaid shirt right

826
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,900
then which one of us has to get off the

827
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,819
internet and write like can you kind of

828
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,620
like are you and do you have some

829
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,710
prescription or suggestion that you

830
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:41,220
found on that so there was a there was a

831
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,160
case in the US a Supreme Court case I

832
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,129
think in 2010 I think the case is Dovie

833
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,720
read and and in that case it was about

834
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:53,640
whether I was something to the effect of

835
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,770
either either voter registration lists

836
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,540
or donors to political organizations

837
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,580
whether those could be kept secret or

838
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,230
whether they could be published and one

839
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,680
of the things that the that the court

840
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:06,690
found is that a way to tell whether it

841
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,060
was okay to publish these lists or not

842
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,060
is whether it would open up the people

843
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,279
on the lists to harassment from private

844
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,710
parties because if the government

845
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,850
publishing these lists meant that

846
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,590
private parties would threaten in harass

847
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:25,410
then that meant those parties rights to

848
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,080
speech was being infringed and therefore

849
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,220
the government couldn't do it so I think

850
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:36,540
that I think that from a legal point of

851
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:39,180
view it's a gray area as far as what

852
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,610
constitutes enough threat or enough

853
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,480
harassment that someone's free speech

854
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:48,090
rights are being infringed on but when

855
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,450
we share this commons when we go online

856
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,910
when we have things like twitter the

857
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:59,100
freedom to say things and to be present

858
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:01,740
in those spaces is a right if you if you

859
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,350
said something unpopular and a news

860
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,330
anchor that evening did a story on you

861
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,670
and it's like his children go to school

862
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,710
at this at this address wouldn't be a

863
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,950
shame if something happened to them I

864
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,950
think you would agree that like that is

865
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:20,189
an infringement like on your right to

866
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:22,250
speech if you have powerful entities

867
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,040
that are non gun governmental

868
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:29,500
threatening you threatening your kids

869
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,110
daxing your house or swatting your house

870
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,030
that impacts your ability to do those

871
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,770
things the fact that it's not the

872
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,600
government doesn't mean that those

873
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,340
rights don't exist or that they're not

874
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,640
being infringed it just means we don't

875
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:45,520
have you know 200 or 500 years of legal

876
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,049
precedent to look at for guidance but if

877
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,290
you care about free speech you have to

878
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:53,200
care about the speech of people who are

879
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,720
not safe when they talk even if it's

880
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:02,879
from other people exercising their free

881
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:05,950
speech I want to thank you for this

882
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,540
helpful talk and I know you've raised a

883
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,390
lot of important issues I don't want to

884
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,910
detract from anything you said but I but

885
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,580
I do want to say something that I think

886
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:20,470
is relevant about my experience using

887
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:23,110
Mozilla products so my my experience is

888
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,839
that when I use Mozilla products it

889
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,020
keeps defaulting me to Google search

890
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,320
engine will send in keystrokes to Google

891
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:38,140
and I when I go go to work and I use

892
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:40,570
Firefox the it's always it's it gets

893
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,879
reimaged the machine I use gets reimaged

894
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,710
every day so it's and then of course

895
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,130
this admins are incompetent so it gets

896
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:50,470
put back to us into a Firefox image with

897
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,030
terrible privacy settings and far and

898
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,310
Mozilla makes it very difficult to

899
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:56,860
change the privacy settings well not

900
00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:00,100
buried but unnecessarily difficult you

901
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:02,740
have to be in reboot if Firefox if you

902
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,670
want it and change several things and so

903
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,160
on

904
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,810
and I feel like when I my experience

905
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,149
dealing with Mozilla is its list like

906
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,580
this this organization is focusing on

907
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,680
delivering to me a standards compliant

908
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,940
browser which is not all what I want I

909
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,680
want to scrape or damn it and I'm - and

910
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,270
I'm not pretending that's going to help

911
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,609
of everything you're talking about but I

912
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,920
just want to say that even though your

913
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,480
points are very important there does

914
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,040
seem to be a significant amount more

915
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,970
that Mozilla could be doing differently

916
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,040
than it does now and maybe your model of

917
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:37,899
what users want the idea that users want

918
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,759
a standard compliant browser all the

919
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,030
time and they don't necessarily want to

920
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,850
make it eat missile isn't easy for you

921
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,470
to make more of a scraper I think that

922
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,950
Mozilla might want to rethink that

923
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:52,540
because Mozilla it is not for profit it

924
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,890
doesn't have to say well we don't think

925
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,700
there's a market for this it can leave

926
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:59,319
the way some studies do okay thank you I

927
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,569
think that I mean obviously I don't work

928
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,540
in in in Firefox product development I

929
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:07,180
do know that people generally who work

930
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,400
at Mozilla work there you know at the

931
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,569
risk of sounding glib because they want

932
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,090
to change the world

933
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,870
Mozilla tries to put its money where its

934
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,740
mouth is

935
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:19,240
we quit advertising on Facebook earlier

936
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,359
in the year because we felt like their

937
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,270
policies their default policies weren't

938
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:28,750
what we consider to be good for their

939
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:32,370
users and you know the reason that your

940
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,930
search defaults to Google is so that

941
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,080
Mozilla can make money to do all of this

942
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:42,069
work right over 95 or something like

943
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:45,040
that percent of Mozilla's entire revenue

944
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:48,550
comes from things like search engine

945
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,790
referrals so at the end of the day it

946
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,950
needs to be self-sustaining but I can

947
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,960
promise you that the people who set

948
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:58,960
those features and who set those

949
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,810
defaults are doing it in a way that they

950
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,840
feel is best for the users from a

951
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,130
security point of view and if you feel

952
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,090
like there's a better way that they

953
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:15,040
could be doing it I I think that that

954
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:16,900
they would be receptive to hearing hi

955
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,660
yeah thanks for the interesting talk

956
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,400
back to the WeChat thing one of the

957
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,770
thing I was thinking about is a lot of

958
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,600
folks I've talked to in Silicon Valley

959
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,670
have been seeing things going on in

960
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,339
China and the growth of WeChat and the

961
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:32,440
growth of that industry within China and

962
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,880
my feeling is like it's been almost like

963
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,920
it's been supported by the government

964
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,260
and here you see like in this example

965
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,990
the WeChat is becoming like a state ID

966
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,370
it's like there's no doesn't seem to be

967
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,859
a separation of like the large

968
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,440
corporations from the government's so

969
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,960
the question is like us here in in our

970
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,990
society here what can what can we really

971
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,670
do to sort of keep this sort of thing

972
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,069
from coming in too you know

973
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:00,339
into our side of it with things like

974
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:03,519
Facebook being like so large and stuff I

975
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:05,200
mean what kind of things can we do well

976
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,490
I think that it's different in the West

977
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,410
because in the West

978
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:11,470
honestly governments don't want to get

979
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,720
into it governments are largely not

980
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,899
actually interested in pursuing that

981
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,359
level of scrutiny and control and that

982
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:23,650
that might sound naive but there was

983
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:26,200
actually a DARPA project maybe seven

984
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,869
eight years ago that proposed a lot of

985
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:32,019
what ended up being the same mechanisms

986
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:34,510
that Cambridge analytical relied on that

987
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:35,799
was proposed and shut down because the

988
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,779
government felt they were not in the

989
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:40,240
business of doing that kind of data

990
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:43,269
collection that kind of work on their

991
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,910
own citizens so what's happened is the

992
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:47,890
private sector has done it for them so I

993
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,690
don't think that in the West the problem

994
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,549
we need to worry about is governments

995
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,210
getting in bed with Facebook to get

996
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:55,538
access to this data I think that it's

997
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,789
everyone else

998
00:44:55,539 --> 00:45:01,990
I think it's political campaigns I think

999
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:06,369
it's you know banks insurance

1000
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:08,258
anyone who has realized that that when

1001
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:10,990
you have this much information and you

1002
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:12,789
have sites like Facebook or Twitter or

1003
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,399
any of these places that are in almost

1004
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:18,190
entirely funded by advertising by

1005
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,769
knowing things about you those sites are

1006
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:23,109
big behavior modification machines you

1007
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:25,328
go on them Facebook makes money by you

1008
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:27,460
clicking on an ad Facebook figures out

1009
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,529
how do we make this person more likely

1010
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,170
to click on ads and some of that is nice

1011
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:33,309
in that they will show you fewer stories

1012
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,690
that you don't like they'll show you

1013
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:38,470
more stuff from your friends that'll

1014
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:40,569
keep you on the site longer but at the

1015
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,220
end of the day it is changing the way

1016
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:45,910
you behave on it so it can make more

1017
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:50,160
money so I think that the part of the

1018
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:54,549
way we protect against that kind of

1019
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,098
future here is by from a legal point of

1020
00:45:54,549 --> 00:46:00,640
view looking at laws that protect data

1021
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:02,500
the gdpr is a good example of laws that

1022
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,558
have really spent a lot of time thinking

1023
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,950
about what's involved in someone's data

1024
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,140
getting transferred from one end

1025
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,868
to another what is the right of a user

1026
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,848
to say delete everything you have on me

1027
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,970
and if we can extend that kind of

1028
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:19,609
thinking in those kind of protections to

1029
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:23,598
Silicon Valley I think that we'd be in a

1030
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:25,430
much better position hi so a lot of

1031
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,130
people here work for very big companies

1032
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,210
and of course Sauer job to speak up in

1033
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,680
meetings and try to prevent our

1034
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,839
companies from doing things that would

1035
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,490
harm internet house but what are

1036
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:35,839
examples of ways that employees of big

1037
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,790
companies can try to convince those

1038
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,828
companies to use their vast resources

1039
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:42,589
for ways that would improve internet

1040
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:49,250
health unionize

1041
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:51,049
that's answer number one yeah I think

1042
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,640
that I think that and I think we only

1043
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,490
have time for one more question

1044
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,549
I think that that in tech we have this

1045
00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:00,649
idea that a lot of tech companies are a

1046
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,599
meritocracy and we got to where we were

1047
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:05,630
because we're very good at what we do

1048
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,820
and often that is true but the reality

1049
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:12,079
is that as individuals we do not really

1050
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:14,390
have the ability to leverage our our

1051
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,849
views and demands on the companies that

1052
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,770
we work with because we are individuals

1053
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,750
and the way that you change that is

1054
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,099
unionizing if you have a union of

1055
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,880
workers if everyone on Facebook was

1056
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:28,790
unionized and the Facebook Union went to

1057
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,220
the suck and was like we go on strike if

1058
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,020
you do this they wouldn't do it so I

1059
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,720
think that that's that's honestly the

1060
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,960
best way to approach that any other

1061
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:42,140
questions I know that was a line up

1062
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,420
before before so I think yeah we have

1063
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,670
one more but come to me after say hi

1064
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,640
come to the workshop happy to chat more

1065
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:52,220
last question um back to WeChat real

1066
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,348
quick have we seen any corporate

1067
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,149
conglomerates or Western companies

1068
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:57,530
already try to implement some of the

1069
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,480
features that we're seeing in China now

1070
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:02,089
I mean I think that I think that

1071
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,770
Facebook pays a lot of attention to what

1072
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:06,078
we chat is doing when it comes to

1073
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,030
getting people to see it as part of

1074
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,970
their daily lives and not just a website

1075
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,569
that they go to I don't think that there

1076
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:16,220
are any other sites that are just

1077
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:20,860
individual sites as compared to like an

1078
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,870
ecosystem the Google ecosystem that are

1079
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:25,900
thinking about it the same way Facebook

1080
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,730
is and I think in part that's because a

1081
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,080
lot of the companies look at it and say

1082
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,980
that isn't actually the future that we

1083
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:37,120
want but but I don't think we're really

1084
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:41,410
seeing it over here yet okay thank you

1085
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:44,870
so much and come see us at six

1086
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,870
[Applause]
