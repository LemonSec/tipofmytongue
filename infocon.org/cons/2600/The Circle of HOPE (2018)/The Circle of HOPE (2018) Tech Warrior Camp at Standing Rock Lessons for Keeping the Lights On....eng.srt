00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,288
called frontline wellness I hope you'll

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,879
come to our workshop at noon just like a

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,160
little shameless pitch

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,050
or they've changed the name of the

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,440
workshop we're doing at noon in the in

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,949
the brochure the the real name of the

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,010
workshop is assholes and infiltrators so

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,460
hopefully you'll come and find out all

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,620
about assholes and infiltrators and that

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,120
workshop actually came out of some of

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,629
the same work that I'm gonna be talking

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,269
to you about here at Standing Rock so

19
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,250
this talk is a tech warrior camp at

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,950
Standing Rock lessons for keeping the

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,299
lights on and the live streams live

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,390
feeds streaming so I've given a bunch of

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,700
talks about Standing Rock about what we

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,549
did about the security issues that we

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,540
had there and I wanted to make this talk

26
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:28,909
a little bit different so although the

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,130
first part of the the presentation

28
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,409
slides are actually pretty much the same

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,820
slides as from my other talk it's mostly

30
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,630
so you guys can see the pretty pictures

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,699
before I move into like the real meat so

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,839
we're gonna be clicking through a bunch

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,210
of slides pretty fast but let's let's

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,700
start off with something how many of you

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,860
guys have heard of Standing Rock and

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,290
what happened at Standing Rock okay

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:01,320
almost everybody how many of you have

38
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:04,680
heard of the uni Stoughton camp not a

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:10,049
single one of you so I think that they

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:13,530
are now in their eighth year how many of

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:18,990
you are aware of the Bayou Bridge camps

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:23,130
a few how about the scible pipeline

43
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,730
camps pretty much the same people water

44
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,730
protectors over here line three have you

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,130
heard of line three oh we're down to one

46
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,470
water protector in the room that knows

47
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,829
of line three and how about the dapple

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,350
camps in Iowa there's a few people okay

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,420
so why do you think that you've heard of

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,890
some of these and you haven't heard of

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:52,380
others I think that there is a

52
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:56,910
combination of factors that one of the

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,380
key factors is social media use so some

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,540
of these have been using a lot of social

55
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,579
media by you bridge line three but a lot

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,989
of them haven't used social media hardly

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:13,319
at all the only certain camp does have a

58
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:15,540
social media presence but it's not a big

59
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,078
presence and it's mostly just the

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,780
leaders and organizers of the camp that

61
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:25,380
that put things out by the way I'd like

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:31,500
to apologize to the nation if I am

63
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:34,049
pronouncing uni Stoughton wrong but so

64
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,590
you're not you're not seeing a lot of

65
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:41,340
live feeds or pictures from the general

66
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,290
public from that camp and and you're not

67
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,120
really seeing a whole lot on social

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,440
media from some of these other camps as

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,910
well and a big reason why everybody

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,700
knows about Standing Rock is because

71
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,820
first there was a lot of grassroots

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,828
social media action to get the

73
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,890
information in front of people and then

74
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:08,519
because it became viral on social media

75
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,369
the ordinary media couldn't completely

76
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,950
ignore it but even if the ordinary media

77
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,299
hadn't picked up on it a lot of people

78
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,180
would still know about Standing Rock

79
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:22,500
because of how much effort was put into

80
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,919
the social media presence and that's an

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,110
important reason for why I ended up

82
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,120
going to Standing Rock

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,670
so it seems like everybody in this room

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,080
knows what this is about but in case

85
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,000
there's anybody on the internet who

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,919
happens to be watching this who doesn't

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,740
know what it's about

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,600
there was a pipeline there is a pipeline

89
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,910
but back at this point there was a

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,690
pipeline plant called the Dakota access

91
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:55,500
pipeline and it was plans to go across

92
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:59,940
the Missouri River and also through some

93
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,850
sacred lands that belonged to by treaty

94
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,100
the rights to them belonged to the

95
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,510
Standing Rock Sioux tribe and not just

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,720
the Standing Rock Sioux tribe actually

97
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,640
that the treaty gives the rights to the

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Lakota and Dakota Dakota people in

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:19,260
general and permission was not received

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,950
from the signatories of that treaty to

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,630
put this pipeline through and so there

102
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,099
were direct actions on the ground

103
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:32,969
including a massive camp that at one

104
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,450
point was the third largest city in all

105
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,750
of North Dakota which i think is pretty

106
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:44,729
impressive for a place that before and

107
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,120
after is literally just an open field to

108
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,260
give you some idea of how remote this is

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,810
this is the satellite image of where

110
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:58,320
Odisha cooing is a chatty shot going by

111
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,330
the way by the way is Lakota for the

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:06,120
seven fires or the seven council fires

113
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:11,640
it is the name of the Lakota Nation in

114
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:16,770
Lakota this place was also very much a

115
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:21,300
war zone my my first hint that this was

116
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:24,120
a war zone was when I arrived coming

117
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,520
down the the highway towards the camp

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,810
about 30 miles outside the camp there's

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,010
this this roadblock and and the

120
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:38,520
roadblock really reminded me a lot of

121
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:41,219
roadblocks in the West Bank and that is

122
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,810
not hyperbolic at all the

123
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:52,410
were National Guard with rifles and they

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,770
would stop you and if you were white

125
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,320
they would ask you have you been down

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,330
this road recently and if you said no

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,190
they would say well we just want to let

128
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,260
you know that there are some camps down

129
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,880
here and there are some people who might

130
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,650
be walking along the side of the road so

131
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,130
please drive carefully thank you very

132
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,039
much

133
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,920
and they'd let you through and if you

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,210
said yes they'd say okay they let you on

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,710
through now if you were quite you had a

136
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,750
very good chance of not being allowed

137
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,849
through it all there was a place there

138
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,070
where they would make you turn and go

139
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,210
the long way around they weren't

140
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,640
actually stopping you from going to the

141
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,669
camp they were just making you take an

142
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,800
hour and a half to take a drive that

143
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,799
should have taken 30 minutes that's it

144
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,000
so these are some pretty pictures in

145
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,580
case you haven't seen what the camp's

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,010
look like it was really dramatic and

147
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,979
amazing to come upon this place and see

148
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,539
all those TVs and all those tents but as

149
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:57,780
you can see there's no mains electricity

150
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,300
no running water no sewer nothing like

151
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,299
that there are some awesome

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,860
revolutionaries holding up worried

153
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,500
monkey so when we got there or before we

154
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,070
got there we knew that one of the keys

155
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,570
to Standing Rock already was the fact

156
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,050
that they were getting the social media

157
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:22,260
word out there and they didn't have any

158
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,540
internet at the camp's you had to travel

159
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,000
10 miles to get to the casino to use the

160
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,840
internet and the cellphone connection

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,169
was bad if not completely non-existent

162
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:39,838
in the area because this is really the

163
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:43,610
middle of nowhere but the Standing Rock

164
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,320
Sioux tribe does have their own ISP and

165
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:51,510
mobile phone company called Standing

166
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,970
Rock telecom and so what we did was we

167
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,530
connected directly to Standing Rock

168
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:03,730
Telecom

169
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:10,540
using ubiquity power beams and beaming

170
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:13,900
the the network from where the Internet

171
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,920
backbone basically comes into the tribal

172
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,630
lands at Standing Rock telecom to a hill

173
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,250
outside of camp because we didn't have

174
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,810
direct line-of-sight from one place to

175
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,680
the other so we went to a hill outside

176
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:29,770
of camp and then beamed it down into

177
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,739
camp and from there we had a small mesh

178
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:37,990
network which sometimes was bigger than

179
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,200
others we'll get to that in a minute you

180
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,060
can see my other talks to find out how

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,490
the plan of exactly how we would lay out

182
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,890
the network changed and why but I just

183
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,410
want to say that if you're going to put

184
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,220
together a network for a community that

185
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:59,050
is not your own take the time to listen

186
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:03,820
to the people that are there we thought

187
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,740
that because the sacred fire was a place

188
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,470
where everybody gathered that there

189
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,200
should be a network connection there had

190
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,150
we not bothered to listen we probably

191
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,910
would have put one there and that would

192
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,160
have made people very upset the people

193
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,689
that mattered that is it would have made

194
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,400
other people very happy because we were

195
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,320
being told by white people constantly

196
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,110
right up to the very end why don't you

197
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,230
have a network node at the sacred fire

198
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,230
and the answer was because the Lakota

199
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,650
don't want one there that's the sacred

200
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,800
fire so please when you go into another

201
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:47,260
community make sure to listen before you

202
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:49,780
act all right so we ship we we had to

203
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,480
ship in a lot of equipment and we were

204
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,530
concerned about things getting messed

205
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,270
with so we had stuff drop ship to UPS

206
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,089
I'll tell you that I don't think that

207
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,430
that did us much good because the rate

208
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:08,430
of hardware failure was way above

209
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,430
coincidental

210
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,190
we had to do a lot of driving to find

211
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,250
the place where we would be able to get

212
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,420
the internet down into camp but that

213
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:23,060
means that I got to see lots of

214
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:27,560
beautiful North Dakota slash Lakota

215
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:30,290
Territory views so you see in that one

216
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,469
picture down there there is an old

217
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,990
I'm guessing it's like from the 1930s

218
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:41,270
windmill defunct windmill and that

219
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:44,930
became our ad-hoc Tower on a hill which

220
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:48,079
is actually a sacred place we we were

221
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,939
required well we were asked but we

222
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,740
required app of ourselves because we

223
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,260
were asked that every time we went up

224
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,270
there that we would bring tobacco and

225
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,790
lay it at these stones at this sacred

226
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,380
site because it was kind of a big deal

227
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,469
that we were putting up network

228
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,850
equipment there but this you'll see this

229
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,040
same tower in a little bit and it

230
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:13,160
becomes unrecognizable almost so you can

231
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,170
see the Nano beams where we were

232
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,730
catching the internet in camp and you

233
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,819
know here's some of the process of us

234
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,820
getting it all put together like I said

235
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:31,339
there were a lot of hardware failures we

236
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:34,730
had to swap out a battery like you know

237
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:42,290
one of those big batteries we had to

238
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:45,020
swap out a router we had to swap out one

239
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,240
of the power beams there there were just

240
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,850
a lot of things that failed straight out

241
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,180
of the box that just should not have

242
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:57,200
been ok so here's some more pictures of

243
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,750
us getting that ready but I'd like to

244
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,720
remind you that this was a war zone and

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,360
there went my phone so this was a war

246
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,880
zone I I want to make that really really

247
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,400
clear because when you're thinking about

248
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,540
putting together your networks even if

249
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,089
you're putting together a network in

250
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,459
your hometown you need to think about

251
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:19,160
what's going to happen in disaster

252
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,959
situations or you know when the

253
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,939
government does stupid things

254
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,920
when I say that this was a war zone I

255
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,410
say it because I'm comparing this to the

256
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,839
low intensity warfare tactics that are

257
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,980
used by the United States government and

258
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,500
trained by the US military to other

259
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,820
militaries around the world to use

260
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:49,550
against insurgent organizations they

261
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,660
were using infiltrators in a few minutes

262
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,140
you're going to see some pictures of

263
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,550
where they cut wires they were

264
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,020
destroying our solar systems on a

265
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,120
regular basis they walked away with

266
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,270
entire solar panels they walked away

267
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:12,440
with deep-cycle batteries they walked

268
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:15,800
away with a nano beam one time they had

269
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,990
people if you've heard of red fawn if

270
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,010
you haven't heard of red flower up she

271
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,470
was actually framed by a guy who

272
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:28,880
infiltrated the camp's managed to become

273
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:31,400
her boyfriend and then planted his own

274
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,110
gun on her so that she would get

275
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,310
arrested and she's now going to jail for

276
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:40,010
57 months even though she was framed

277
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,150
because the courts wouldn't let her show

278
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,920
the evidence of being framed and of

279
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,589
course there was the super militarized

280
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,560
police and I'm sure all of you guys have

281
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,380
already been complaining vociferously

282
00:14:51,560 --> 00:15:00,859
about how the US police or the police in

283
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:02,839
the US have gotten militarized so we had

284
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,079
a lot of troubles getting our network

285
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:09,320
started and in the process of that over

286
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,479
the course of a month of work some of

287
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,550
which was diplomatic work and some of

288
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,040
which was swapping out gear that should

289
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,370
have worked when it showed up but didn't

290
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:24,790
it we finally got the network running

291
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,790
and hold on

292
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:36,960
stop sorry we've either got the network

293
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:39,839
running and to this day I'm disappointed

294
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,330
because I tweeted boy boy at the very

295
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,880
first site that we connected to was

296
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,980
Boing Boing and they didn't retweet us

297
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,779
or anything my feelings are hurt all

298
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,390
right so I was telling you about

299
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:58,290
infiltrators so they knew that we had

300
00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:00,600
internet a couple days later and they

301
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,610
started immediately trying to sabotage

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,399
us they didn't know we had wireless

303
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:10,200
internet so they went they went to the

304
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:12,450
closest fiber box and tried to mess with

305
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,459
the fiber which when we discovered that

306
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,100
we thought that was hilarious but I also

307
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:21,180
feel bad for whoever had fiber to their

308
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:26,970
homes that got messed with and then the

309
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:31,739
winter set in we lived in tents with

310
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:37,890
wood heaters and our solar systems kept

311
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:41,250
the lights on we used LED Christmas

312
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,720
lights so if you ever find yourself in a

313
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,040
situation where you need to keep the

314
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,660
lights on and don't have a whole lot of

315
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,760
power

316
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:53,660
remember LED Christmas lights they are

317
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:57,330
the bomb here's an example of another

318
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,569
solar system so we had trailers like

319
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,790
this we had I want to say four trailers

320
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,790
like this this wooden belonged to the

321
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,629
red lightning crew who were also the

322
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:12,000
people who owned that dome in the back

323
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,400
for anybody who did come to camp the you

324
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,189
know the dome the dome was basically the

325
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,400
community meeting place other than the

326
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:22,559
sacred fire it was a lot warmer than the

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,199
sacred fire cuz less you were right next

328
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,160
to the sacred fire it was pretty cold

329
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:33,090
and we had heaters inside the dome there

330
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,740
were morning meetings every 9 a.m. in

331
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,550
the dome there were dances Thanksgiving

332
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,070
dinner at the

333
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:47,190
this was a major important place so red

334
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:50,220
lightning brought this solar system and

335
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,980
the tech warrior team although we didn't

336
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,020
install this system and several of the

337
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,230
other systems like it we were still

338
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,420
responsible for maintaining them and

339
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,740
when they got damaged we would get

340
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,750
called up on the radio and one of the

341
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:12,510
the guys or gals that worked with me

342
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:15,540
would head down and fix things as I was

343
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,290
saying before they the infiltrators were

344
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,830
quite active

345
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:24,629
there was a nano beam up there somebody

346
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:26,760
knew that the Nano beam used power over

347
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,860
ethernet so they didn't just cut the

348
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,300
thing down they first sabotaged the

349
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,129
solar trailer that you just saw in the

350
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,520
previous picture so that it wouldn't

351
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,980
have power going to it and then they cut

352
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,900
the thing down and we're assuming that

353
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,820
the reason that they walked off with the

354
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,190
whole nano beam was because they were

355
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,950
hoping to get our passwords into our

356
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,780
network and so as soon as we found out

357
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,250
that this happened we had to change all

358
00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:00,330
of the passwords for the whole network

359
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:03,960
are the this is that same tower that you

360
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:07,139
saw at the beginning and this tower had

361
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,080
some problems because we got regularly

362
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,770
got 60 mile an hour winds sometimes even

363
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,199
higher and when you're rigging things up

364
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:19,920
with you know chewing gum and duct tape

365
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,610
the winds will have some effect but an

366
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:28,470
amazing woman by the name of Jill ADA

367
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,659
Burroughs went up in a snowstorm at like

368
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,540
20 below zero which is when this

369
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,780
photograph was taken and I have no idea

370
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,129
what magic she did but after we'd been

371
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,530
going up there every two or three days

372
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,700
to fix it after she did whatever magic

373
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:48,500
she did to that tower the wind didn't

374
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,500
knock anything over for over a month

375
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,860
so that's that's the overarching story

376
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,510
of what happened at Standing Rock like I

377
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,129
said there are other talks that go into

378
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,020
a lot more detail about what happened at

379
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,560
Standing Rock what I really want to talk

380
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:12,900
to you about is the lessons from all of

381
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:15,120
this so first off first off the

382
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,510
revolution is not going to be televised

383
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,179
unless it is live streamed first you

384
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:25,060
need to have internet if you're going to

385
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,280
get the word out about whatever the heck

386
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,100
it is that you're doing you need to take

387
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,310
pictures you need to take video you need

388
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,800
to post memes you need to get the word

389
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:39,040
out by all means necessary have people

390
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,930
write essays medium whatever get the

391
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,500
word out encourage people to use their

392
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:46,410
social media to share whatever it is

393
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:51,370
that you're working on with your friends

394
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:54,700
I'm focusing a lot on why we need the

395
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,330
Internet in situations of activism but

396
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,360
the same thing is true in situations of

397
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:05,500
say a refugee crisis or even an

398
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,090
emergency right a disaster because if a

399
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,350
disaster happens in the United States

400
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,990
we're probably going to know about it

401
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:14,590
because of the news but if the disaster

402
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,650
is going on in you know an island nation

403
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,330
that the US news doesn't care about how

404
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,620
are we going to find out about it the

405
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,090
fact of the matter is we're only going

406
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,280
to find out about it if people are able

407
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,310
to get the word out through social media

408
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,100
and if they're going to get actual real

409
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:33,639
aid there you need people outside of

410
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:38,560
their you know small environment to know

411
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,910
what's going on yeah that's that's all

412
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,889
I'll say about that and the

413
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:50,260
international aid system except to say

414
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:52,240
that if if the general public in high

415
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,700
resource countries like the United

416
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,190
States and like Europe don't know about

417
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,130
some disaster that's happening in some

418
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,780
smaller poorer country those people just

419
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,560
really are not going to get the help

420
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,090
that they need

421
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,260
but if we do know

422
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,939
and we're talking about it and we're

423
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,110
worried about it it puts the pressure on

424
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,870
it puts the pressure on the larger

425
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,428
organizations to get the things taken

426
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,070
care of but it also gives us the

427
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:22,090
opportunity to do grass works grass

428
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:25,750
roots work to help out and also in the

429
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:28,209
case of a refugee crisis like what's

430
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:32,740
happening to the Rohingya Muslims so who

431
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:36,070
knows about the Rohingya and the fact

432
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,020
that they're in Bangladesh right now so

433
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:42,010
there's a fair amount of people that

434
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:47,980
know and this is a case where the news

435
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:49,360
is talking about it but from from what

436
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,100
I've been able to gather from

437
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,469
conversations with people people know

438
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,270
sort of these like broad overarching

439
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,850
things about what's going on but don't

440
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,879
necessarily know the specifics and not

441
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,149
that many people know how they can help

442
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,120
and being able to use the Internet

443
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:09,250
actually helps those people connect with

444
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,100
people that are close to them that

445
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:16,380
actually can help geographically close I

446
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,719
mean so lessons learned from all of this

447
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:23,230
people issues are harder to hack than

448
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,840
tech at Standing Rock one of the reasons

449
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,210
that it took us so long to connect to

450
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,699
the internet was because I felt that it

451
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:36,760
was really important for us to connect

452
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,049
to the tribes own internets and not

453
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,600
connect to an outside network provider

454
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,950
partly because it was a matter of

455
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,939
supporting the tribe we were here for

456
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,770
the tribes sovereignty and and around

457
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,750
this issue yes it this was an

458
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,230
environmental issue but this was also

459
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,230
very much a tribal rights issue because

460
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,490
the pipeline was being put through

461
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,260
despite the fact that there is a treaty

462
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,620
saying that you can't do that without

463
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:10,029
their permission so I wanted to stand on

464
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:12,030
that on that ethic that we had to

465
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:17,080
support the tribal

466
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:20,889
sovereignty we also had troubles with

467
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,939
just getting permission to be in the

468
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:29,560
place where the hop Hill was like I said

469
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,730
we we did get trained and told what we

470
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,220
were supposed to do when we were up on

471
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,370
that hill it took a lot of listening

472
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,830
took a lot of learning and not coming in

473
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,419
and being like oh we're the techies we

474
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,760
know what to do we're just gonna fix

475
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:48,520
this for you you you just can't do that

476
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:50,320
and not be well an asshole and if you

477
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,910
come to the thing at 12 we're all

478
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:58,030
assholes but let's try to be less

479
00:24:51,910 --> 00:25:00,150
assholes anyway so another big lesson

480
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,370
learned is that your first priority for

481
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,440
telecoms is electricity if you're in the

482
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,560
middle of nowhere or if you just had a

483
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,360
disaster you might have the best network

484
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,220
gear in the whole wide world if your

485
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,719
electricity isn't working it's going to

486
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:19,030
do you absolutely no good and so a lot

487
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,700
of times what we would do is we would

488
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,500
set our morning priorities of get the

489
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,030
electricity up and running in this place

490
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,550
in this place in this place so that

491
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,860
tomorrow we can set up some network gear

492
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:36,580
there or you know so-and-so said that

493
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,860
their power has been sabotage go fix

494
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,220
their power so that we can have Network

495
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,959
there and of course having power wasn't

496
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,550
just about having the network it was

497
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,360
also about having LED Christmas lights

498
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:52,030
so that you could see at nighttime but

499
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,659
if if your electric systems work or

500
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:58,660
don't work nothing else is going to

501
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,310
another is no your threat model I did

502
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,720
not know my threat model going into

503
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:07,000
standing rock standing rock completely

504
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,090
completely changed my life on so many

505
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,570
levels and one of them is that after

506
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:16,449
years and years and years of being sort

507
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,960
of theoretically paranoid now I am

508
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:22,119
deeply and viscerally paranoid about

509
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,579
everything

510
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,039
whereas it was always about those other

511
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:30,009
people over there that need to be

512
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,509
concerned about surveillance suddenly it

513
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:38,079
became extraordinarily personal and I

514
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:41,169
hate to say this but for the vast

515
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,809
majority of us we are not going to

516
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:47,349
really comprehend our own threat model

517
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:50,739
until it's it's brought face to face

518
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:53,109
with us so if you know somebody else

519
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:55,869
who's already in the midst of whatever

520
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:57,668
threat model you're dealing with talk to

521
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:03,570
them and listen to them pay attention

522
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:07,059
don't I can't think of the word

523
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,458
don't ignore when somebody says no

524
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,389
really I need you to put that phone in

525
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:15,669
the Faraday cage

526
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:18,099
it may seem a little paranoid to you or

527
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:21,279
a lot paranoid to you but they probably

528
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:22,809
have a good reason for it

529
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,299
the other thing assholes and

530
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,729
infiltrators like I said 12:00 p.m. you

531
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:30,129
totally want to come to my workshop with

532
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:32,799
Joel it's really important to have

533
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:34,329
appropriate paranoia so one of the

534
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,989
things that happened at Standing Rock is

535
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:40,389
that pretty quickly once we knew that we

536
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,829
had lots of infiltrators we and you

537
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:44,049
can't possibly know who those

538
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:45,309
infiltrators are well some of them you

539
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,739
can figure out but most of them you

540
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,979
can't so then everybody started thinking

541
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:51,729
that everybody was an infiltrator I was

542
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:55,450
an infiltrator

543
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:57,429
Jonny Aaron was an infiltrator who he

544
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,450
was like the second in charge of the

545
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:05,109
whole camp the the tribal chief was an

546
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,029
infiltrator everybody oh my god did you

547
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:09,999
notice he did such-and-such do you think

548
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:12,999
he's an infiltrator and the answer that

549
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:16,179
we came to somewhere in like early

550
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:18,299
December I think was no no not an

551
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:22,239
infiltrator just an asshole

552
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:25,359
so like learn to recognize is somebody

553
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:26,950
doing stupid things cuz you know they're

554
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,259
human and they're an asshole just like

555
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,419
the rest of us or is it something more

556
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,019
serious

557
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:37,529
and how are you gonna deal with that

558
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:39,419
working with volunteers and I would say

559
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:41,249
this goes actually working with

560
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:45,480
employees as well if you do have some

561
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:48,480
sort of employee situation have a clear

562
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,389
onboarding process you may be in the

563
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:56,009
midst of a crisis because you're at a

564
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:58,049
refugee camp or an emergency response

565
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:00,690
situation but you still need to have a

566
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:02,549
clear onboarding process think about

567
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,100
that before you ever go out if you have

568
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:06,539
the opportunity but even if you don't

569
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,580
have the opportunity and you just find

570
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,379
yourself in the midst of it take the

571
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,399
time even though you don't think you

572
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:16,889
have the time make the time to create a

573
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,459
proper onboarding process because it

574
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:21,928
will save you so much time later on also

575
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,999
make sure that you have your secure

576
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,340
network configuration in greater than

577
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:29,039
two places it's a greater than or equal

578
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,399
to but really greater than two places we

579
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,749
had a situation where our entire network

580
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:36,268
configuration booklet with all of the

581
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:38,549
passwords and IP addresses and

582
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:45,029
everything ended up going on a trip to

583
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:49,679
Tanzania by accident yeah irony all

584
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:52,590
right so more networks what we learned

585
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,129
at Standing Rock has allowed us to help

586
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:59,309
a bunch of other people think about and

587
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:03,149
plan and build other networks as these

588
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:06,690
resume is in the process of building a

589
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:09,899
wireless network for the row row hinga

590
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,330
refugee camps in Bangladesh and he and I

591
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:14,729
have spent many long hours on the phone

592
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,449
discussing the environment looking at

593
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:22,919
maps figuring out what the best network

594
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,369
gear for him is there's also a couple of

595
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,399
local communities in India rural

596
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:32,580
communities that have terrible internets

597
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:35,428
and some other issues let's just say

598
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,820
that with their internet access and so

599
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,200
they're building their own networks

600
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,470
there's one that I didn't add on here

601
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,470
that actually predates Standing Rock and

602
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,650
is we worked on a project that we called

603
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,780
canoe net which was putting together

604
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,480
networks that aren't directly connected

605
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,850
to the Internet but have their own

606
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,090
internal in their village Wi-Fi

607
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,949
connections and the content that the

608
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,370
community wanted from the Internet's

609
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,590
would be brought on a hard drive by

610
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,870
canoe that's why it's called canoe net

611
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,620
from the closest town that actually has

612
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,658
internet out to the jungle and they you

613
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,850
know had their server where they could

614
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,289
actually get things like Wikipedia and

615
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:24,299
stuff like that locally for local

616
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:27,210
education that is a really good that's a

617
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,340
good network model for some communities

618
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,990
who don't necessarily need to have a

619
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,709
connection to the outside world all the

620
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:36,690
time but want to have the ability to

621
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,760
have network communication within a

622
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:43,710
specific zone myron Dewey has been

623
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,789
working for a while now on trying to get

624
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,650
a a Wi-Fi network connected at the

625
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,929
Walker River Paiute reservation in

626
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,650
Nevada

627
00:31:50,929 --> 00:32:00,090
unfortunately in 2017 I had you know

628
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,020
pretty much no no resources to go down

629
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,439
there myself

630
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,840
and help out and I hope that he's able

631
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,730
to get that done and you should totally

632
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,280
do this in your hometown and they're

633
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,900
telling me that we need to stop that's

634
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:20,010
why the lights are on I'm guessing no

635
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:24,270
it's only ten thirty three okay so I'll

636
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:35,809
just keep going so so why do you need to

637
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:35,809
do this look at me I'm the president

638
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:45,870
all right so why would you want to do

639
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,580
this in your hometown uh net neutrality

640
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:53,879
maybe uh I'm a big believer in community

641
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:59,189
owned and community operated companies

642
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:01,800
coops and I hope that you are too I know

643
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,570
it's great to be able to come in and be

644
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,899
the grand dictator of all things and

645
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:09,990
just make things happen because meetings

646
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,520
are long and boring but despite the fact

647
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:16,500
that meetings are long and boring if you

648
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,820
can work together as a community you can

649
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,570
create something that's much more

650
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,760
resilient and and hopefully won't get

651
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:28,500
swallowed up by one of the big companies

652
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,260
that is too big to fail you can also

653
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,150
build resist resilience into your system

654
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,590
while resistance as well build

655
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,950
resistance into your system please

656
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:41,939
people build resilience into your

657
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:44,670
systems by well for one thing not being

658
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,390
too big to fail yourself so if you're

659
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,700
small you can experiment with things and

660
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:53,700
and try things that the big companies

661
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,730
aren't necessarily going to try and if

662
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,600
you're a co-op you're able to spread the

663
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,220
risk of success or failure among the

664
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,409
community of people who are willing to

665
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,780
take this risk together you know in

666
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,340
small measure all of us taking the small

667
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:12,960
risk together as we put these things

668
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:15,690
together evolutionary improvements come

669
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,850
from heterogeneity and if we're not

670
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,720
trying lots of things we're not gonna

671
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:24,560
move things forward and and improve just

672
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:28,138
the the system in general but also

673
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,469
heterogeneity means that if there is a

674
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:34,980
disaster that takes out all of X kind of

675
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:38,009
system then there's Y kind of system

676
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:42,629
that might still be standing an example

677
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:46,139
of this the US government has decided

678
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:49,168
that we no longer need to rely on Hamm's

679
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,539
for emergency response

680
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:54,719
and about a year ago they were telling

681
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:56,339
Ares that oh we don't really need you

682
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,660
anymore because now we've got this

683
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:04,410
contract with AT&T and AT&T has set up

684
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,950
these special super hardened mobile

685
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,990
phone systems and all the emergency

686
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,450
responders are gonna have access to

687
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,058
these super awesome hardened mobile

688
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:19,609
phone systems and so we don't we don't

689
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:21,569
need your radio relays anymore so

690
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:23,190
Washington State

691
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:25,650
well the Pacific Northwest in general

692
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,119
but but I have been living in Washington

693
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:34,410
State so I know about what happened in

694
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:38,519
Washington State did a practice run what

695
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:41,279
do you call that a an emergency exercise

696
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,848
thank you words it's really bad that I'm

697
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:47,309
a speaker and I can't think of words so

698
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:51,359
they did they did an emergency exercise

699
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:54,690
on what would happen if the Cascadia

700
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,420
fault were to go you know nine point

701
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,190
whatever earthquake and there were all

702
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,289
sorts of horrific things that they

703
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,150
discovered like we are completely

704
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:06,390
unprepared and cannot possibly be in

705
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,309
cannot possibly be really prepared but

706
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,038
among other things it became super

707
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:15,210
obvious that that hardened AT&T network

708
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:19,259
was going to do no buddy any good and

709
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:23,869
really they need ares and the governor

710
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:26,759
of Washington state and the head of

711
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:29,970
emergency response for Washington State

712
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:32,190
said yeah we definitely need you guys

713
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,500
Ares keep keep doing what you're doing

714
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:38,039
because we need you when it all goes bad

715
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,710
so that's just an example if we have

716
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,960
only one system only one company only

717
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:48,119
one way of doing things then when

718
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,839
something breaks we're all it's good so

719
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,839
what do you need

720
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:57,329
ah what do you need have i harped enough

721
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,449
that you need reliable power whether

722
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:03,079
you're building this in your community

723
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:07,009
or whether you're working on helping

724
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:11,819
support a water protector camp or

725
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:14,819
whatever future occupy style camp might

726
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:15,989
exist or the next arab spring or a

727
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:17,940
refugee camp

728
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,920
whatever whatever it is that you're

729
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,999
building a network for you're going to

730
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,400
need reliable power and even even if

731
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:29,399
you're at home even if you are in your

732
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,099
hometown do not think that your main

733
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,880
security your main security your mains

734
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:38,849
electricity is secure enough sure use

735
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,119
your mains electricity that's great but

736
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:45,859
have backups so that when there is an

737
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:51,630
earthquake hurricane of whatever happens

738
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:53,848
that you can connect in your backup and

739
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,069
have your network up and running even

740
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,900
when the big guys aren't able to get it

741
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,880
running in your neighborhood because

742
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,099
your neighborhood isn't rich enough or

743
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,739
important enough or whatever for the big

744
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,959
guys to care about at the same time that

745
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,449
you know that you live in your place and

746
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:13,348
it matters to you

747
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:15,900
you're gonna need network equipment so I

748
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:19,309
meant to put a bunch of links in here to

749
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,259
companies for network equipment and I

750
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:26,369
sorry to say I was finishing up this

751
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:27,599
this morning and my Wi-Fi hotspot

752
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:33,180
wouldn't let me connect it to my

753
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:36,839
Evernote so I promise you all that later

754
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:40,469
on when I'm at the hotel and and not

755
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:44,880
here on a you know Wi-Fi with lots of

756
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:48,390
hackers I will try again to connect to

757
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,959
my Evernote and when I post these live

758
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:54,868
on the glob website it will have links

759
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:57,808
to a bunch of different companies also

760
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:02,190
by the way a number of the companies

761
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:05,460
that sell Wireless ISP equipment like

762
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:08,490
ubiquity have online

763
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,859
like videos or podcasts basically

764
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:14,520
courses in how to set up your own ISP

765
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:17,819
and there is even a website called set

766
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,579
up set up know start start your own ISP

767
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:23,099
comm I think it is so there's actually a

768
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:25,260
lot of resources out there on how to

769
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,380
start your own ISP

770
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,290
and it's worth taking the time to learn

771
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,819
how to do it a lot of them will go on

772
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,369
and on and on about how much money you

773
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:37,829
need and the fact of the matter is if

774
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:42,240
you're trying to make a neighborhood or

775
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:45,809
a community network say here in the

776
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,549
United States in a city like New York or

777
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,780
something like that in addition to all

778
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,250
of your network gear you're probably

779
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,260
gonna need to spend a lot of money on

780
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,940
lawyers unless you can get the lawyers

781
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,190
to donate their time in exchange for

782
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,280
internet connection or something I don't

783
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:02,359
know because there's there's legal

784
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,760
issues but if you happen to be at a

785
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:08,339
resistance camp or if you happen to be

786
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,040
on sovereign Native American territory

787
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:16,849
you can possibly give the big middle

788
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,799
finger to whomever needs middle fingers

789
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:25,170
so you're gonna need a connection to the

790
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:28,079
Internet as you heard before we had a

791
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,599
local trusted ISP at Standing Rock and

792
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,579
in some cases you will have a local

793
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,540
trusted ISP that you can connect to

794
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:39,150
that's super easy it doesn't you know it

795
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,480
doesn't take much effort if you do have

796
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,790
a local ISP that you can go and talk to

797
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,299
the managers and work all that stuff out

798
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:55,259
but there are tier two network providers

799
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:58,859
that will give you basically a much

800
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:03,329
fatter connection which will cost you

801
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:06,150
less in the long run your your actual

802
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:09,660
bandwidth once you spread it across all

803
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:14,460
of the people within your network really

804
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:17,098
becomes almost not free but you know it

805
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,020
approaches zero the more people you have

806
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,760
involved in your network

807
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,960
when you're not just connected to a

808
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,460
local ISP but really become your own ISP

809
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,660
you're gonna need to have people to keep

810
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,230
it running

811
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:33,450
whether it's volunteers on on-site for

812
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,940
something like Standing Rock or whether

813
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:41,029
its employees we're gonna keep it

814
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:44,550
running there are people who run rural

815
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:48,150
Wireless ISPs where it's literally one

816
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:51,510
guy keeping the whole rural ISP running

817
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,040
here in the United States and those guys

818
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,470
say that basically they never have

819
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,940
vacations they spend a lot of time

820
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,220
waking up at 3 o'clock in the morning

821
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,190
it's kind of like having an infant for

822
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,450
the rest of your life so you you don't

823
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,090
want to do that you don't want to be the

824
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:09,210
one guy trying to do this make sure that

825
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,790
you have a few other people and this is

826
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,460
one of the reasons to have a co-op

827
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:18,330
because you can find the way to balance

828
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,850
out you know trade versus cash in order

829
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:23,910
to make sure that you've got the people

830
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:25,830
who are you know not just being abused

831
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,020
to be used at 3 o'clock in the morning

832
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:33,470
but are actually getting something out

833
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:39,060
of being part of that and security poof

834
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:41,250
there is an entire talk I gave a talk at

835
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:45,740
lightnings fest Northwest and I gave

836
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:48,690
another talk at Segal I think

837
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,939
specifically about security issues that

838
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,040
we faced at Standing Rock and if you're

839
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,440
really interested in what we had to deal

840
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,600
with there purely on the security side

841
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,730
you can look at those but I just want to

842
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:04,140
say there is nothing that you can do

843
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,790
that's gonna make your network a hundred

844
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,379
percent secure I don't think that I have

845
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,180
to say that to the people there in this

846
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,190
room but maybe the people who are

847
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,710
watching it on YouTube in the future or

848
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,880
something I don't know there's nothing

849
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,100
you can do to make it a hundred percent

850
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,540
secure so you want to make sure that the

851
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,910
people who are using your network

852
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,759
understand about encryption and use

853
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,529
encryption and encrypt all the things

854
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,230
but you also want to make sure that your

855
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,260
network is as secure as possible you use

856
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,880
tools

857
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,320
Splunk used to be a sponsor of geeks

858
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,480
without bounce but they're not a sponsor

859
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,480
of us anymore so I don't feel like I

860
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,450
have to you know apologize or whatever

861
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,400
but spunk is a really good tool for

862
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:49,589
keeping track of what's happening on

863
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:52,680
your logs security onion I hear somebody

864
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:56,300
say it's funny I can't see you guys at

865
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:00,540
all oh there you are

866
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,790
so yeah having using tools that will

867
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,700
help you to actually parse your logs and

868
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:09,750
and know what's happening who's trying

869
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,089
to connect through your network or you

870
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,760
know knock on your door those are very

871
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:17,310
important but also physical security as

872
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:23,190
you saw it Standing Rock we had a lot of

873
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:26,580
physical security issues I would say

874
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:31,560
that one of the best tools is a hunting

875
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:32,940
camera so a Wi-Fi camera if your Wi-Fi

876
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,910
goes down whoops

877
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,609
you you don't have your evidence but

878
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:41,549
with a hunting camera placed it you know

879
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:44,730
strategically pointed at your network

880
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,369
gear if something does happen you can go

881
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:50,730
find out what's going on and if you

882
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:55,470
check that regularly you can check for

883
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:57,210
people coming by and surveilling the

884
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,750
site before they actually do something

885
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:03,990
to it as well so do use cameras whether

886
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,600
you're using Internet connected IP

887
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:09,569
cameras or whether you're using

888
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:13,730
unconnected hunting cameras and going

889
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,730
and picking up the SD cards we

890
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,180
frequently it that's really important

891
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,950
because you're probably not gonna be

892
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:26,160
able to have a person standing by every

893
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:29,368
single Network gear also I want to

894
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,690
mention there's more there there's more

895
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:36,060
than one way to skin a cat as user azul

896
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:40,619
was working a few years ago on a really

897
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,690
cool project i think that he was forking

898
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,530
a project that came out of germany if

899
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,650
i'm not mistaken

900
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,610
but as eases project was called

901
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,050
delightful or I should say is called

902
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:53,520
delightful I'm pretty sure it still

903
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:56,850
exists in in its you know named form the

904
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:01,490
project itself obviously exists but so

905
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:06,350
the original project was like these two

906
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:09,870
cans with lights and a light sensor and

907
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:12,390
instead of having fiber-optic cable

908
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:17,759
they're just you know pointed at each

909
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:19,799
other across space right and you get

910
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,540
fast internet just like you would over a

911
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:28,380
cable the problem is you need

912
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:31,860
line-of-sight of course and things like

913
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:34,980
fog and weather can interfere with your

914
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:37,080
network connectivity but he figured out

915
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,470
that actually you could do the same

916
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,940
thing and just make it a light pole and

917
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:46,640
so this project that he's been working

918
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:50,340
on in Pakistan is providing light

919
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:53,210
streetlights and Internet at the same

920
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,670
time so this is something to consider

921
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,670
that project by the way is open source

922
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,290
and I really encourage people to to fork

923
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:05,550
and make more of that happen in the

924
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:08,210
world so I've only got a few more

925
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:11,490
minutes so I'm gonna skip over this and

926
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,500
get straight to the whoa pilla thank you

927
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,529
to the youth of Standing Rock who led

928
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,540
the call to protect the mini so say the

929
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,190
Missouri River and to the people of the

930
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,960
Great Sioux Nation who welcomed us into

931
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,660
their land I'd like to thank all the

932
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,670
volunteers the donors the supporters the

933
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,330
keyboard warriors the senders of

934
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:32,160
chocolate I love you and all the other

935
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,950
water protectors and I'd also like to

936
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,460
thank the people who answered my

937
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:41,460
GoFundMe because geeks without bounds

938
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,920
lost our fiscal sponsor at the end of

939
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,890
2018 because the school factory closed

940
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,560
down and we didn't get a new fiscal

941
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:54,540
sponsor until literally this last month

942
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:56,440
and so I've been employed but unemployed

943
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:00,259
ie I haven't had

944
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:03,160
salary or anything since January and so

945
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:06,079
I put out a GoFundMe to come here and

946
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,460
thank you to everybody who made it

947
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,970
possible for me to get to New York and

948
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:18,650
be here thank you

949
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:18,649
[Applause]

950

ten oh okay so we're ten of so we don't

951
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,940
really have any time for questions but I

952
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:32,299
will be around I'm gonna walk that way

953
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:35,480
so that the next person can get up here

954
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:37,730
