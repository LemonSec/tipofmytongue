1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
so our little talk here in Ricci this

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,509
morning is one that was inspiring to the

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,940
to the committee as part of that

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,450
committee that was looking at the

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,809
submissions of talks and who is also

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,210
going to be inspiring to you we have two

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,279
young hackers not inspiring hackers but

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,800
fully qualified certified and now you're

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:01:21,000
at hope this is it right is your

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:01:25,320
authorized program are three plea you

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,780
may wonder how I got started I got

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,089
started off with scratch and first ring

13
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,549
what scratch is scratches draw

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,580
drag-and-drop blocks that tell scratch

15
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,450
the cat

16
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:42,490
the adorable and his friends what to do

17
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,220
it introduces you to basic recruiting

18
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,339
concepts and some of the things I made

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,740
with it is I made a soccer game where

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,710
there's a goalie and then of course the

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,479
net and you have to try to chase the

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,919
ball into the net without the molle

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:07,120
touching it and I made my mom she's over

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:13,860
there okay some fun an interactive card

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:16,420
for her birthday more about scratch a

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,820
great book is the Super Stretch

27
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,980
programming adventure book which is

28
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,459
actually available from no starch press

29
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:28,959
which is the upstairs so you should look

30
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:32,080
into that and what the Super Stretch

31
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,140
book is is she's trying to save the

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:43,450
world and you have to come date so that

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:46,839
you can also in first grade I made an

34
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,079
LED solar dollhouse for the science fair

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,120
i soldered it all together and it has

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:59,550
solar panels LED diodes resistors and it

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,550
even had rechargeable batteries so they

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:13,890
and let me tell you a little story once

39
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,959
upon a time I made LEDs for dog house

40
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,320
and that was the night on this sighing

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,250
in despair everybody was running around

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:30,750
having fun and there was this guy named

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:40,740
Brian smut Brian smart made a solar doll

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:50,190
house to put in a solar panel party at

45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:53,100
night but my good not so smart as in a

46
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,430
great book to start off with electronics

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,180
is definitely the force means the third

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,459
game started in electronics book is so

49
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,650
cool because they have like cartoons on

50
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,090
every page to explain how things work

51
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,959
and what they would have be as resistors

52
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,959
see up there

53
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,700
and everything I learned I learned on

54
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,430
the internet I mean the Internet is your

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,260
best friend people I mean these days if

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,470
we didn't have the Internet and baby

57
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:33,599
wipes and work cushions we would not

58
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,600
survive our species would just die and

59
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:42,310
some of the it resources is like

60
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:45,090
electronic stuff where they have many

61
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,860
tutorials on how things work the main

62
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,020
projects like one of the projects that

63
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:56,080
island that was a Christmas tree with

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:00,219
LED lights and run by an Arduino and

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,849
another great one is adafruit.com like

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,680
that's like the best one in my opinion

67
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:11,500
that from a website and has project

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,830
tutorials and step on step instructions

69
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,470
and videos and all you need and it even

70
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,359
lists all the parts you need for that

71
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:30,400
one project so it has like everything

72
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:32,200
there in Arduino I'm pretty sure most of

73
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,380
you know what an Arduino it is but in

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,060
case you don't Arduino this small

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,639
microcontroller which is like the next

76
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,719
step in programming there are tons of

77
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,780
online resources again internet people

78
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:50,830
couldn't survive without it

79
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,888
they have many projects you can do and

80
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:58,430
here you see that little badge yeah it's

81
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:01,729
actually also set up right here they see

82
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:05,330
accidental blinking thing that's an LED

83
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,639
matrix badge the LED matrix patch like

84
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,969
this one has blinky heart blinky heart

85
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,719
senses beyond it it's really cool and

86
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:20,629
another thing I made with with an

87
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:21,409
Arduino the light-up headband it's

88
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,750
pretty cool

89
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,750
I made it with neopixel leds to

90
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:35,449
Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is so huge it

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,529
could be on the top by itself which I

92
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:42,439
should actually do work on yeah so it's

93
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:47,300
a full-on computer in it and it runs

94
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:50,900
like it is so cool and it's only $70 for

95
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,240
a full set when the rest may you have a

96
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,568
website the Raspberry Pi website teaches

97
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,289
you how to code and has a project it's

98
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:02,569
super cool and if see that but learn to

99
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:08,029
program with minecraft there's even a

100
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:10,879
book where you program and then instead

101
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,700
of building all all entire house which

102
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,940
may even take days and days

103
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:21,469
my trap snap snap snap

104
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:25,010
it's just there and I'm flesh after just

105
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:28,400
a few lines of code and over here you

106
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:31,340
see that picture of that man well they

107
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,219
even have something where you can take a

108
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,549
picture of yourself and it converts it

109
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,650
into an actual minecraft blocks the

110
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,650
giant version of which is actually

111
00:07:44,680 --> 00:08:10,910
speaking of a great way to learn is join

112
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:16,760
group groups are great way to meet and

113
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:18,890
learn from others local DEFCON and 2600

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,659
groups are rule over the world

115
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:27,140
and tool to us awesome or about that if

116
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,310
their main free online classes where you

117
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:36,140
can just learn learn how to happy and

118
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:40,150
everything like yep hacker cause aren't

119
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:43,429
great you should really start small like

120
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:47,959
besides and you couldn't even look for

121
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:50,750
kids tracks there they even have the

122
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:53,270
things like the structured calendar

123
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,480
where you get to taste stuff apart and

124
00:08:53,270 --> 00:09:00,199
break it up and it's awesome they have

125
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:05,330
pretty challenges like here I'm doing my

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:09,620
crypto top at be fence del where they

127
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:12,440
have talks for kids and biases and you

128
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:23,540
will hear adult language and see people

129
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:26,150
like like purple what to do well at

130
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,420
least like New York I got at the foot

131
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,810
bones firmware and I removed the chip

132
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,760
using on hot air using hot air soldering

133
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,589
which was cool and in the router hacking

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,370
IOT village they have in the Internet of

135
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:54,080
Things village teaches hacky hardware

136
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:56,030
routers cameras etc it was cool tool you

137
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,600
should also learn lock-picking it's a

138
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:02,380
very very fun invaluable skill like if

139
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,380
you get to jail

140
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,950
you're at your work and your boss says I

141
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:16,550
want these foils and I want now or

142
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:21,650
earlier fire you know how black bosses

143
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:27,319
are always so no you forgot the key to

144
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:36,680
your filing cabinet here's the file now

145
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:40,910
not fired CTS in crypto challenges CTS

146
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,969
are everywhere sea chests are so much

147
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,630
fun especially with people you should

148
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:51,230
only settle for one flag at me and then

149
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,390
the rest is easy peasy lemon squeezy and

150
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,270
you should really join a friend or

151
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:59,060
someone you don't even know like go up

152
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,040
to person and say hey I don't know you

153
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,020
you seem to be working on this one work

154
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,300
together you guys can learn from each

155
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:10,370
other and it's all happening Care Bears

156
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:13,280
and Dora and rebels and blessed and

157
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,770
corrective challenges are awesome like

158
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,040
this trip to challenge it's actually a

159
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,819
choose-your-own-adventure but it was

160
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,819
super cool

161
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:37,000
so have your thumbs are great but base

162
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:41,200
cons aren't your grater it's pretty one

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,340
it gets call again common in debt money

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,270
has a roots of silent which is just for

165
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,880
kids

166
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:53,250
they have many cool things and talks and

167
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,430
everything that drawings and SEC TAS and

168
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,320
all different things any mods have a lot

169
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,650
of training classes too if you want to

170
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,930
learn more about anything and hope is

171
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,780
another great one you guys should really

172
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,180
go to home yeah you really have to go

173
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:19,030
you know if you haven't been there it's

174
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:21,939
very safe speaking of I met Sebastian

175
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,589
he's a biologist and a white Walker he

176
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,950
guided me on researching the Hawks

177
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,710
Elster that which is play and over here

178
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,800
in this picture the one where he's with

179
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:36,220
me actually we were cloning it back open

180
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,729
but not Glenda see definitely not from

181
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:43,270
the seat from the plant we cut up the

182
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:48,790
flip chip chop chip and then with the

183
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:51,689
lease it grew from the leaf people at my

184
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,689
site

185
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:02,120
project and vet grade I did the NS media

186
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,850
which is a group of five chemicals and I

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,880
buried them out of ammonium nitrate to

188
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:12,260
the to ox officer finish on it the less

189
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,270
the better and I use the Raspberry Pi to

190
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,750
control the experiment again raspberry

191
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,689
pi immediately get one people play

192
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,240
around with it and I built a really

193
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,940
control outlet to control light so it

194
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,070
turn on the lights and it had a

195
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,640
time-lapse camera so I take a picture

196
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,620
send it to be a bio lab different from

197
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,250
be Scilab that's mine where I do all my

198
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:40,610
science stuff turn off the lights and

199
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:45,410
send it to Twitter and I did all with

200
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:49,490
Python Python is great people and that

201
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:53,660
led to my sixth grade science fair it

202
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:58,120
was really really a big pain giving a

203
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:01,969
specific amount to each and every plan

204
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,860
science is so hard especially when you

205
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:09,530
have to water stuff with chemicals and

206
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,050
so I made you water but the water bot

207
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,850
what measure the amount of water

208
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,859
dispensed then print out the mount on a

209
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,900
thermal printer and again with the

210
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,580
Raspberry Pi people could be a talk by

211
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:25,100
itself and I put all my code on github

212
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,150
if you want to learn more about my water

213
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,980
bot at the at DEFCON in the bio hacking

214
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,030
village I'm actually doing my more

215
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:38,090
in-depth talk there

216
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,089
[Music]

217
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:48,979
we're hacking a great online website is

218
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,520
heck the Box hack the box you actually

219
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,460
have to hack your way in to get an

220
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,279
account it's just what it is is it too

221
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,370
safe online hackable computers they'll

222
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:07,100
let you practice your hacking skills

223
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:11,240
yeah and a great thing to have is a

224
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,330
basic toolkit in your basic toolkit you

225
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,390
should have a box to keep all your stuff

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:22,279
in and especially kids should have a

227
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,990
tool kit let them play around and if you

228
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,029
should have a box so you don't leave

229
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,390
stuff everywhere and trip and fall birth

230
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,490
your head lalala and what you should

231
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:36,199
have in that box is Phillips and flat

232
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:41,950
head screwdrivers pliers needlenose and

233
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,690
regular pliers measuring tape hammer

234
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,310
flashlight you never need you never know

235
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,810
when you need to go into a deep and dark

236
00:15:46,310 --> 00:16:00,560
place duct tape and safety glasses and

237
00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:04,489
remember and after you get used to that

238
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,369
you you should um get mini screwdrivers

239
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,670
a soldering kit like if you don't know

240
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:17,420
how to solder go learn people in a

241
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:19,520
portable vise and you should always

242
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,900
build a home lap even if it's in the

243
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,600
garage or in the basement anywhere in

244
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:30,709
your bedroom in the bathroom don't that

245
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,650
be weird a great way to set it up is get

246
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:35,540
old computer set people are like oh I'm

247
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,769
just gonna throw it away because I'm

248
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,410
getting the new

249
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:44,550
computo that's like has all-news goblets

250
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,889
Tov take their old computers and set up

251
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,709
as hacking targets you could try to hack

252
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:52,860
those old computers or try new operating

253
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:56,790
systems like you're at home and say L I

254
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,709
want to try Kali Linux on my computer

255
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,618
but I like don't know how it's gonna

256
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:05,339
like like B so I'm like gonna try on

257
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:08,579
like like my old computer people and

258
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,789
have old networking gear so you can

259
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,678
capture packets and learn networking if

260
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,199
you want to be a better hacker you need

261
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,079
to know learn networking it's like a big

262
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:23,640
thing and you should have a 3d printer a

263
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,398
solder station parts parts parts and

264
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,380
great lighting cuz you don't want to be

265
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:31,559
like oh it's so dark goodbyes have to

266
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:38,909
hammer in this nail off my finger ah the

267
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:42,418
pain the torture continue eat some

268
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:46,380
takeaways remember scratch great way to

269
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,909
start off Python Raspberry Pi the

270
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,190
forstman's getting started in

271
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:52,980
electronics great book Adafruit of

272
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,149
course have a tool kit and build a whole

273
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,149
lap and remember

274
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:19,960
and now on to my good good luck out

275
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,959
there

276
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:40,220
your check for explosives exactly

277
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,600
especially in a hotel that's actually

278
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,600
letting us be here

279
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,059
see

280
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:22,710
so you've started now what I'm visible I

281
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,120
go by Ranger Co say on Twitter I'm 15

282
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:29,160
years old and I'm a beginner in the

283
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,090
InfoSec community a lot of my interests

284
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,650
range around computers music cryptology

285
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,199
mathematics theoretical physics

286
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,820
penetration testing system building and

287
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,160
going to cons such as hope I'm here

288
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,399
because I want to provide resources for

289
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:54,179
beginners I know that learning from the

290
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:56,640
very beginning sucks a lot and keeping

291
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,520
momentum going after you've started is a

292
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,590
very very hard thing to do such also

293
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,940
starting is one of the hardest things to

294
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:08,159
do and I also want to help

295
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,830
what do I do I do software design and

296
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,720
hacking I do a lot of web design some

297
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,309
system administration and I enjoy

298
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,690
building computers and messing with

299
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:21,299
hardware who do I work for currently

300
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,549
nobody I did work for Nova Corps and

301
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,410
Legion gaming community I'll also work

302
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:29,340
for anyone with money if you've got some

303
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:33,419
offers what fields are good for

304
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,760
beginners web design is a very good

305
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,950
field for getting a field for more

306
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,520
text-based languages when you're getting

307
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,650
off of something like scratch or my

308
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,190
school uses MIT App Inventor in their

309
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,320
intro to CS II class and then the next

310
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,970
class up from that is their ap CSP class

311
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,010
and the first thing you learn that class

312
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,320
is how to program in HTML and that's

313
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,040
switch you off of thinking without a

314
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,100
syntax when using block based languages

315
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,370
so WordPress is good for setting up a

316
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,969
blog but it's not good for learning a

317
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,489
lot of HTML and CSS more advanced things

318
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,150
javascript is also fun if you feel like

319
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,150
dealing with it

320
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,760
I also do system administration a lot of

321
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,939
it is basic it's a very very good way to

322
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,490
learn the ins and outs of networks and

323
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:29,390
how a CP IP works how to mess with

324
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,549
firewalls routers etc a lot of it

325
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,240
involves patching systems a lot of

326
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,120
maintenance

327
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,679
it also requires setting up networks and

328
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,678
making sure people don't get viruses

329
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,230
breaking things breaking things is a

330
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,679
very very good way to get a starting hat

331
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,350
in hacking breaking networks is very fun

332
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,450
as well as other systems like just

333
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,399
ripping apart your computer to find out

334
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,970
what's inside it that was fun

335
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,919
and you can also break people doing

336
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,919
something such as social engineering

337
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,390
there are a lot of good habits you can

338
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,730
and probably should build if you're

339
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,890
trying to get further in the field so

340
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,070
the most important one that I realized

341
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,520
is setting realistic and realistic goals

342
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,549
something like learning how to do tcp/ip

343
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,360
in a month or two the basics of Python

344
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:32,030
in three or four weeks

345
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:35,570
realistic goals really help you know

346
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:38,178
what your capabilities are and if you

347
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,830
learn faster than you expect it to then

348
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:43,940
you can just set back your goal a little

349
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:46,309
bit and move further a setting time

350
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,299
apart in a schedule is also a very

351
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:52,610
important thing for learning more that's

352
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:55,220
part of the realistic goals part so set

353
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,229
apart two hours a day to study this

354
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,309
thing for whatever certification you

355
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:04,130
want to get and it helps a lot

356
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,860
creating good notes is also very good so

357
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,780
vias father's company hands out

358
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,149
notebooks to their employees

359
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,770
a lot of companies really like to

360
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,620
encourage note-taking and it's a very

361
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:19,570
good thing it's not childish it's not a

362
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,570
high school thing always take notes

363
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:27,310
don't be afraid to ask questions

364
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,920
so when I was 10 years old I attended

365
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,590
besides fur I think the third time after

366
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,150
being dragged there by my father and I

367
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,419
don't know if any of you know dr. Russ

368
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,500
but he is a big SDR nerd and I said oh

369
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,360
that looks cool

370
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:48,400
and I sat him down for about four hours

371
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:50,110
and forced him to teach me SDR also

372
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,210
anyone who does not want to answer your

373
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,129
questions or refuses to answer your

374
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,860
questions you probably don't want their

375
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:02,050
answers just some good advice for the

376
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:04,780
future attend talks and talk to a lot of

377
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:13,330
people so talks are great places to

378
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:16,750
learn also take notes of these a very

379
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,699
good way to learn more is interact with

380
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,950
the person that does the talk afterwards

381
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,800
by asking questions so we're probably

382
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:27,480
gonna have 15 to 20 minutes for

383
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,909
questions that anybody wants after this

384
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,370
some other good notes are a lot of good

385
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,980
learning resources online I'll put these

386
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:39,189
links online somewhere or I'll give them

387
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,100
to radios that later Google a lot of

388
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,990
things Google is the savior of every

389
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:51,000
hacker ever it's great local cons and

390
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:51,000
meetups are great as well as BMN shinned

391
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:57,280
other bigger cons so kid tracks if

392
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,230
you're trying to get a very young kid

393
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,899
into hacking like a 7 year old

394
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,790
I run spawn camp at b-sides Delaware and

395
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,940
I try to make it as interesting and fun

396
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,100
and informational as possible for kids

397
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,170
who are coming in here especially the

398
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,209
kids who are like well this is a thing

399
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,210
that you do dad I don't want to do this

400
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,310
attend big talks so talks such as those

401
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,260
at something like Derby con they usually

402
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,510
have a lot of high informational value

403
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,860
and if you can't attend them look them

404
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:35,590
up online also do talks it's terrifying

405
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,870
but it is so much fun ways to test you

406
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,330
know

407
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,059
I'm finding quite a few of them are hard

408
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:45,559
for different fields but if you're into

409
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:48,289
cryptology or basic encryption hi Pico

410
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,840
CTF is a very very good one for

411
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,850
beginners going to cons and finding

412
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,709
something as the pros versus Joe's that

413
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,870
I participated in last year at b-sides

414
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:04,549
which is a full-on insane hacking

415
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:06,529
attempt so you've got you've got pros on

416
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:08,389
the blue team and red team and then

417
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:10,070
you've got noobs underneath them who

418
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,230
listen to the pros and the Blue Team and

419
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,658
Red Team go against each other and it's

420
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,730
all based in one room and it's it's

421
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,950
really cool there's also the wireless

422
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,740
CTF which is SDR which is what russ was

423
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,960
teaching me I never got much into it but

424
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:28,070
it's also a very very fun field to work

425
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,570
with what can the veterans here do to

426
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,090
help a lot of people like me who are

427
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,970
trying to get into the fields you can be

428
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,949
open so when someone walks up and asks

429
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,840
you a question don't just kind of shrug

430
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,669
them off and say oh you're a kid instead

431
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,029
be like you're a kid who wants to know

432
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:47,539
something I should tell you this teach

433
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:49,429
people offer to teach people or run I

434
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:53,690
think they have villages upstairs

435
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:55,460
teaching soldering if I'm correct create

436
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,990
resources and post about resources

437
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,760
resources are very very good to find but

438
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,460
finding them is the hard part so post

439
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,039
about them and create a lot of them also

440
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,039
if the person's like 7 years old

441
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,529
[Music]

442
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:19,189
simplify things for her that is the end

443
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:23,289
via his requested that I give you

444
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,289
kittens and to not forget Trevor ever

445
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:30,169
many things

446
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,169
[Applause]

447
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,990
any questions

448
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:47,610
hey guys great job I'm a teacher and

449
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,350
director of technology let's assume that

450
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:53,610
there were a school that wasn't afraid

451
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,490
of kids like you I think what's

452
00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:00,120
impossible come out to LA sometime but

453
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:02,280
um what kinds of programs should we as

454
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,030
educators build to support students like

455
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:08,399
you I enjoy the fact that a school like

456
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,190
I just moved recently so my new school

457
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,290
has a full-on STEM program and they

458
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,300
allowed me to design their new

459
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,580
makerspace for that because they knew

460
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,800
that I had experience in the field they

461
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,600
didn't treat me just like some kid

462
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,520
they knew that I had experience so they

463
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,070
allowed me to help them and now they've

464
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:36,000
got multiple laser cutters and CNC Mills

465
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:36,750
and stuff hello uh hello okay it's me

466
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,020
again yes

467
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:44,070
and at my school well when I still went

468
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:50,580
to school now home now I'm homeschooled

469
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:55,800
so yes and my dad um saw the school and

470
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:59,699
in um in computer class we were learning

471
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:05,220
how to make mazes mazes and excel like

472
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:07,890
like really people like really so my dad

473
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,680
decided we need to help these people so

474
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,690
he designed the coding Club where we all

475
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,470
learned Python was it done yeah it was

476
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:19,350
Python and we got kits from the Adafruit

477
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:23,340
and Dan just taught us like every

478
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:29,550
Wednesday it was so cool we we made this

479
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:31,590
game we're ninjas through the a ninja

480
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,730
through throwing stars at bugs

481
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,990
protecting the computer it was fun and

482
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,660
my

483
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,400
friend Kara did something adorable she

484
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,050
changed it to a guinea pig

485
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,670
throwing sunflower seeds at kittens

486
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:51,379
protecting cotton candy it was adorable

487
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:53,630
yeah so it's great like even um maybe at

488
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,030
your kids school so you could even start

489
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,860
your own coding Club you know start with

490
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,629
something like Python or something you

491
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,949
know if they don't have a good computer

492
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:06,650
program or one at all yeah the biggest

493
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,140
part of that is finding more of a safe

494
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:12,350
haven for your child to work with and

495
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,660
learn more things and as a parent you

496
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,360
should get involved to come into the

497
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:23,750
school and say start this club do this

498
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:25,010
thing it's a good idea next question hi

499
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,750
so first I want to thank you guys are

500
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,700
amazing

501
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,470
so successes are really cool but is

502
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,730
there any failure in particular that you

503
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:45,530
learned a lot from that you want to

504
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:48,410
share oh so you guys remember the LED

505
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,178
solar dollhouse right yeah you remember

506
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,960
that I was soldering I was in first

507
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:57,309
grade I didn't see that the soldering

508
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,080
iron was plugged into the outlet and

509
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:02,690
even dad when he unplugged it I thought

510
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,689
it just poof not hot anymore

511
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,559
so I picked it up like a pencil I got

512
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:14,940
burned

513
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:17,940
so I'm saying watch your kids make sure

514
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,070
make sure they're safe and if you're

515
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,460
ever like sitting at the computer

516
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:26,009
talking make sure look at them and say

517
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,659
hey you listening are you awake or are

518
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:33,629
you like sleeping with your eyes open

519
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:39,749
right now and are you okay cuz I see

520
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:41,639
that you're burning yourself so my uh my

521
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:49,729
biggest story of failure might have been

522
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:52,559
deleting an entire server on accident i

523
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:54,450
was working for nova corps and they they

524
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,940
they use debian on all of their servers

525
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,609
and they asked me to update it and some

526
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,470
of Debian's the way it uses paths and

527
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:07,080
stuff are confusing and i ended up

528
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:15,720
deleting about half of our database they

529
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:17,129
weren't happy no surprisingly next so

530
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,169
first of all thank you for throwing this

531
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:21,029
panel I hope it's very enlightening for

532
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:22,349
the people area that I have a question

533
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,389
by us that just want to make comment if

534
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:26,879
anyone here is interested in actually

535
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,678
learning soldering if you go the up the

536
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:30,899
escalators and the mezzanine and you

537
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,369
take a left there's a whole hardware

538
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,809
hacking village with people who would

539
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:36,059
love to help you out including this

540
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:37,979
awesome crazy rainbow haired guy named

541
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,200
Mitch Altman he taught me how to solder

542
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:42,359
and he can if you can teach someone as

543
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,159
dumb as me to solder anyone else can

544
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,639
learn and I solder my question is for

545
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,009
both of you what exciting a new project

546
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:53,908
would you are you attempting now to

547
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:57,179
tackle next after all your achievements

548
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,679
that you've listed here so first I'd

549
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,389
like to interject and say it's rainbow

550
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:07,849
hair not purple hair so it's clearly not

551
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:07,849
a hacker based on vias talk prejudice

552
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,908
okay so what I'm working on I'm actually

553
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:17,689
working with my friends

554
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:20,429
Anna and Abby on a weather balloon

555
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,890
project it's really cool we're gonna

556
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:27,750
send up a weather balloon and

557
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:29,340
and it has these things that in the

558
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,440
different you know stratosphere and

559
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,049
tapas fear and lawless fear and whatever

560
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,210
spheres there are we take a sample of

561
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:38,100
air from each one and then I'm gonna

562
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,780
work with Sebastian you remember from my

563
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,240
talk aware you're gonna work with

564
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,700
Sebastian and we're gonna see what

565
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,490
different bacterias grow in that air and

566
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:55,410
where they came from and why you know so

567
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:57,990
we're working with bacteria I'm working

568
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:01,830
on to know three main projects right now

569
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,240
so the first one is I'm I'm working on

570
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,280
calculus and a bunch of other fun

571
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,320
computer things with advanced

572
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,109
mathematics with a friend of mine who

573
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,940
graduated from MIT a few years ago which

574
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:14,129
is you should really get involved with

575
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,800
veterans and other people in the field

576
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:18,960
that's a very good thing to remember I'm

577
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,840
also currently working on my blog as

578
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,540
well which I'll post on my Twitter if

579
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,669
people want it I'm just teaching myself

580
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,918
more about Python and learning more

581
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:30,658
about competition programming and stuff

582
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,250
because that's what the programming club

583
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,770
I run at my school mainly does is we

584
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,889
will go to competitions and we just mass

585
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,440
hack things and the other one is I'm

586
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:43,679
attempting to design with a Raspberry Pi

587
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,840
a smart mirror which is it's a two-way

588
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,550
mirror where you have a screen on one

589
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,830
side of it and it shines through but

590
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,480
it's still a mirror on this side and you

591
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,399
get a display and everything and you can

592
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,500
hook Alexa up to it you can hook all

593
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,920
sorts of IOT things up to it and then

594
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,840
I'm gonna hack it also just quick to

595
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,310
note when you to finally take over the

596
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,619
world please remember all that says the

597
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,570
little people and have mercy on us

598
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,940
vending machines are gonna take over the

599
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,660
world don't worry just keep all your

600
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,000
quarters in a jar hey how you doing I

601
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,160
got one let you know great talk

602
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,670
fantastic job so simple question for the

603
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,279
both of you and are you both thinking

604
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,530
about this College thing because from an

605
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,380
initial glance and from your talk I'm

606
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,350
debating whether it's actually war

607
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,670
the money where you killed you have the

608
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:36,890
tinkling skill Drake have you even

609
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:39,440
thought about it like I don't know I'm

610
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,350
not sure about her but I thought about

611
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,270
college a lot I my dream school is MIT

612
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,549
because of the culture there that's

613
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:49,820
where hacking started with Peter Sampson

614
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:52,310
and the pdp-11 like it all started there

615
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,770
and I want to get into that culture and

616
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:57,020
meet a lot of people through that also

617
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,660
as I said one of my passions is physics

618
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,360
and that's got a great undergrad physics

619
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,740
program so I want to go to MIT and my

620
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,040
father's gonna hate me for it because

621
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:11,240
it's the tuition but yep it's going to

622
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:14,360
be great if I can get it okay I don't

623
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,580
have a college in mind I just don't I

624
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,320
don't really know where I should go or

625
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,810
anything but I want to become a pen

626
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,810
tester I badly want to become a pen

627
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:26,570
tester it sounds like so much fun

628
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,330
and I'm actually doing training classes

629
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,600
and I'm gonna try to get my what is it

630
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:35,900
called again dad OS CP and I'm actually

631
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:43,069
working on that now so I hope I can get

632
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:45,470
it I can't see if there's another person

633
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,990
yeah there is one hey guys you are just

634
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:50,299
amazing guy I like what you can do what

635
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,140
you have achieved but my question is how

636
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,370
did it happen

637
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,040
you know most to the children nowadays

638
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:57,440
they look into tablets smartphones play

639
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,480
roblox minecraft they are not interested

640
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,820
in anything anything at all and they

641
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,950
have time they watch the smartphone what

642
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,650
was the impulse for you to start being

643
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:11,330
hackers you know to learn all of this to

644
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,860
achieve okay so a great way is don't do

645
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,990
something your kid doesn't like or

646
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,770
something new Seraph with something they

647
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:21,620
do like if they like roblox make them

648
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,720
program their own game Kyle like roblox

649
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,569
or make them program a game that they

650
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,160
can actually play like with Minecraft if

651
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,990
they're really into Minecraft like I

652
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,609
showed you the Raspberry Pi and then the

653
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,799
book of programming and minecraft

654
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,630
because I'm pretty sure they'd like if a

655
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,670
house disappeared after three lines of

656
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,210
code like really and that book is

657
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,700
actually

658
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,700
available at no search press upstairs

659
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,290
and if you have a girl that's like a

660
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,540
girly girl not really like into hacking

661
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:59,570
or anything they're like Ellie my nails

662
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,640
or something like that you know what you

663
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:03,950
could do you could always try making

664
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,180
electronic clothing like this headband

665
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:10,040
or the Gemma you know like all different

666
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:14,419
electronic clothing cuz I'm pretty sure

667
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:16,609
like in the newest maker magazine from

668
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,760
Adafruit you know know the Maker

669
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:22,160
magazine sorry the maker magazine they a

670
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I actually looked through it last night

671
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,200
and I actually saw that they have if

672
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,290
they're really into nails they have

673
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,839
light-up nail things that you can

674
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:35,180
actually program and stuff like do what

675
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:39,500
your kid likes and make into something

676
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,629
you can teach them I'd like to add do

677
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,950
you remember building the pony pie at DC

678
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:48,500
610 we took a pinky pie plushie from My

679
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:52,549
Little Pony and Stuckey electronics into

680
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,339
it and turned it into a CTF that's a

681
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:57,500
very good way to get your daughter into

682
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:59,960
hacking unless she doesn't want to see

683
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:07,339
you cutting over her open her beloved

684
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:09,230
Pinkie Pie plushie another thing well

685
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,000
how I got into the field mainly is my

686
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:14,900
father brought me to b-sides when I was

687
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,240
6 7 years old and introduced me to a lot

688
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,369
of people and let me socialize and find

689
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,669
out what about the field I like and just

690
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:24,320
run around and be me and so running

691
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,849
around and doing all these things I got

692
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,890
to meet Russ and I got to experiment

693
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:29,960
with SDR and I got to find out and I

694
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,598
don't like that so much I got to go to

695
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,910
the pros versus Joe CTF and do that and

696
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:37,070
found out and I like it but it's not for

697
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,080
me and then I got to do actual

698
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,480
programming and I'm like that's for me

699
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,640
just let your kid explore and find what

700
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,859
they want and if remember if they don't

701
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,540
like hacking and computers that's okay

702
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:48,850
maybe they want to go into interior

703
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,880
design someday

704
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:55,310
and another thing is especially with

705
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,320
little kids like they're gonna be bored

706
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:00,200
like Oh two words appeared on the

707
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:08,690
computer after I type this and I'm gonna

708
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:11,299
sleep babies kids people not now roblox

709
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:17,990
on your phone I don't even like roblox

710
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:20,900
so so um a great way especially with

711
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:23,569
blow kids is a lot of little kids like

712
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:27,010
like stuffed animals and stuff even me I

713
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:30,380
am like I'm still and a great way is

714
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:33,680
LEDs like they blink they light up and

715
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:43,880
noises and sounds and moving parts in

716
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:46,399
robots it's called a heinie so start off

717
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,430
with the LEDs and keep working with LEDs

718
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,900
people and kids especially like things

719
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:57,290
that actually do things like LEDs and a

720
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,810
lot of things actually move and talk and

721
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:03,230
speak robots is a great way to start off

722
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,420
people love robots yeah a good robotics

723
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,580
kit is the the Lego I think they're on

724
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,970
TV 3 now that's how I started when I was

725
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,770
like 5 years old I found it in my

726
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,240
father's bedroom took out the kit and

727
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:19,820
started building things you were

728
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:22,189
actually five years old isn't every

729
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:26,060
temptation to put up a middle finger but

730
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:29,660
your father will hit me are there any

731
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,400
more questions yeah yeah I mean you

732
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,279
folks have already figured out that you

733
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,240
know learning and doing things is just

734
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,000
its own reward

735
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,950
it's that's all there is to it but like

736
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,550
half of this conference is also about

737
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:47,960
yeah causes right about doing things for

738
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,070
organizations you know causes and stuff

739
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,920
it's for charity

740
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:54,380
exactly well that and and also you know

741
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,170
real world actors and stuff like that

742
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,390
have you started that what do you where

743
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,279
are you on on that

744
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,980
like this is now what you do with these

745
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:04,539
powers does that really come up yet cuz

746
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,160
I gotta admit there's plenty to do that

747
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:09,069
doesn't have anything to do with causes

748
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,618
I haven't personally gotten involved

749
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:13,900
with any charity stuff yet because well

750
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:16,599
at besides I did some stuff for hackers

751
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,940
for charity but I haven't gotten a

752
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,279
chance to get fully involved into it yet

753
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,410
and start making a difference with it my

754
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:26,230
main focus is learning the things and

755
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:28,210
having fun with them right now and then

756
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,599
when I'm old enough to start my own

757
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:34,390
charity I might start a charity it just

758
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:41,109
depends and we can run it together and

759
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:47,470
call it beer and some other guy can I

760
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:49,480
hit her yet I have a question for each

761
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:54,879
of you Bo what's your favorite thing on

762
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:58,059
hack the box well I basically just got

763
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,430
started and I actually just got in

764
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:03,009
pretty much but then after like yeah I

765
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,078
started oh no now I have to do like 20

766
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:07,660
million talks these four DEFCON fees for

767
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:11,380
hope this for this so like it's pretty

768
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:14,288
hard to find time to actually do stuff

769
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,240
after you're doing so many talks like

770
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:18,460
I'm doing a packet capturing talk in my

771
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,209
water bottle and then this talk and

772
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:24,700
everything you know so like I'm really

773
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,289
gonna get started with hack the box and

774
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,910
I'm really gonna start doing a lot of

775
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:30,700
stuff with it but I haven't had a chance

776
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,710
because I'm pretty busy you know but the

777
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,808
whole homeschooling and then this and

778
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,779
then it's almost hacker week and then

779
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:39,099
it's hacker summer jam and it's gonna be

780
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:40,900
really funny when she hits high school

781
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:45,549
and tries to take AP classes you'll have

782
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:47,140
no time I feel this feel um for you did

783
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:52,799
the schematics for the pony pie ever get

784
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:56,230
released anywhere uh I know it was Eric

785
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:59,529
it was Eric and Nate I think who first

786
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:02,710
designed it it's based off so at Derby

787
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:05,920
con nate and my father gang Griffin's II

788
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:08,019
know phase they built for the hack my

789
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,970
derby contest they built attack derbies

790
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,558
where they released the code publicly

791
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,019
and it ran on docker and

792
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:17,049
was a CTF hat that would attack other

793
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:18,968
hats around it really cool concept and I

794
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:20,890
really like the design they also did

795
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:23,979
ones that it would walk around and you

796
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,359
would hack the Hat itself and you would

797
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:27,489
be able to put things on a display

798
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,969
that's on the side of the Hat I'm not

799
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:33,759
sure if they ever made it safe for work

800
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:35,589
but so what they essentially did I'm not

801
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:38,289
sure if that codes on github either

802
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:40,869
still but if I can find it I'll put it

803
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:42,939
on my blog as well what they did was

804
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:52,269
they just put the CTF hat inside the

805
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:55,709
pony maker god she'll calm and I have a

806
00:44:52,269 --> 00:45:00,899
website two Bs I love gum right oh

807
00:44:55,709 --> 00:45:00,899
you're in domain fancy yeah

808
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:23,600
[Applause]
