1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,759
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:16,890
so some of you guys know me from 2600 or

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:18,570
Twitter or whatever I github so I do

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,779
this for a living I do this for a hobby

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:30,019
I mess with a lot of Linux stuff Linux

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:33,360
routers arm chips you name it so alright

7
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:35,969
so what is the firewall appliance

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:42,170
what is this USB far will appliance that

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:42,170
I I'm trying to do something with so

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,460
it's basically a dedicated network

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,559
security platform with software with

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,840
hardware meant to protect users now

13
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,410
devices and points basically save

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,879
resources and and devices from really

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,709
bad environments protect an Internet you

16
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,679
know protect an infrastructure

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,710
enterprise infrastructure so usually you

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,049
have your firewall it it does more than

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,309
just fireball it would have application

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,880
data it will have a proxy it will have

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,689
many different services instead of

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,460
having multiple independent you know

23
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,919
isolated functional units it will be

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,048
stored in one location and it would

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,939
probably have a failover server for is

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:40,020
it would probably have just whatever the

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,880
enterprise need so there is now is

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,850
Apache whatever it is this is usually

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,679
mostly for you know for customers that

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:52,250
have a lot of money it's not for a small

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,140
office it's not for home users is not

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,689
it's not for even mid businesses is for

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,659
something you know 500,000 users are

34
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:05,669
hired this is a specialized equipment

35
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:09,030
that is you know what a firewall and

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,510
antivirus a you name it it's in there

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,690
and it's Linux I'd you know

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,620
at the bottom of it it's Linux with

39
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,209
different clients customized

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,890
customizations most likely a lot of you

41
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,890
guys actually working on this stuff so

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,540
so so basically this is what I was

43
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:37,870
talking about so this is the Faro

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,010
management the central user management

45
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,060
for access for the web for access for

46
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,399
verification of downloads and

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,580
anti-malware and just web protection

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,549
with proxies any emails that might be

49
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,340
sending out through MCC you know

50
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:57,870
whatever protocol you they'd configure

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:03,040
it to be you know segmentation routing

52
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,660
VPN encryption you know it's a it's a

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,090
very powerful machine if you look at the

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,500
write it you know it talks about you

55
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:13,360
know plot cores or higher xeon sir xeon

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,840
processors or you know they're usually

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,150
stacked in a rack away from their users

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,230
themselves somewhere in a server room

59
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,180
somewhere but this is not what I'll be

60
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,040
talking about today

61
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,970
this is I'm talking about a portable

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,510
version of these this device for the

63
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,030
personal the personal user for something

64
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,350
that's running on arm something that's

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,639
not necessarily as powerful as this

66
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,290
obviously you guys have dealt with Linux

67
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,450
and play with certain things and Linux

68
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,298
where you could see the performance and

69
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,010
some of the aggregation of things that

70
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:55,359
you could add within applications and

71
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,090
customizations of software so that's

72
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:04,599
where you know this really this talk is

73
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:08,799
really about so so this particular

74
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:11,470
hardware was on eBay I was looking

75
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,599
around I was poking around and I was say

76
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,510
well this is interesting I've seen a

77
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,889
previous version of this this is a you

78
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:23,380
know some you know USB device I knew of

79
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,599
a USB version I spoke with a friend

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,500
we got another you know we got a copy of

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,070
it we

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,220
we we purchase multiple online started

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:37,210
poking around you know I wanted to find

84
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,670
out you know what is this software this

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,859
inherits the antivirus what's a VPN

86
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,750
client cannot mess with it can I change

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:49,720
it can I modify it any kind of

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,460
integration even the original code may

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,590
be debug a little bit of what's what's

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,950
actually happening if there's some

91
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,810
customization but it has a lot of

92
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,090
features you've see it on the on the

93
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,480
right here or says it has an anti-virus

94
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:08,469
as spam protection phishing protection

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:12,610
spyware intrusion detection firewall

96
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:17,680
built-in proxy VPN all in this little

97
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:19,510
tiny arm little tiny device that's

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,250
pretty cool I think everybody wants one

99
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:27,610
of these so if you look at the bottom

100
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,660
the USB version is in the person's hand

101
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,060
and I knew I knew of it because there

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,010
were other people in github and in the

103
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,940
past and two thousand and six thousand

104
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,810
seven they've broke into it you know the

105
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,870
vulnerabilities release there were some

106
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,000
information I knew about it long ago but

107
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,410
this new version was very was very

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,330
different I said you know this is

109
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,460
probably the last version it created of

110
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,310
it and is if you could look at it it's

111
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,310
an ExpressCard or at least a four factor

112
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,300
so I sort of poking around so we're

113
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,800
looking and doing more research and to

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:09,370
what the the original USB version is and

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,770
you know is there perhaps maybe has the

116
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,540
same vulnerabilities you know I started

117
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,400
I started looking around I saw that you

118
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,890
know the operating system it is on there

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,659
the version I sort of you know before

120
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,099
even purchase of the device that the

121
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,650
secondary the one I just show you

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,970
the ExpressCard version I started

123
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,109
looking around I said well you know

124
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,850
there's a lot of vulnerabilities to a

125
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,900
lot of these is suffered I mean things

126
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,850
have changed since 2007 and six you know

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,620
I hope they they kept that up to date

128
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:40,330
and if you see the top the the three

129
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:46,240
boxes one is blue

130
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:49,120
green and red it's mostly the same

131
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,879
device with specific software customized

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,830
to just be so as a firewall to just be

133
00:06:51,879 --> 00:07:02,349
sold as a antivirus or anti spyware and

134
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:08,318
then the the blue one is the full the

135
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:10,030
whole enchilada basically so it you know

136
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,800
if you can look stuff you can look this

137
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,138
thing online there's you know you go to

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,110
the FCC ID you start poking around

139
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,360
there's people posting things on it it's

140
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,509
been hacked before I'm not you know not

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:27,340
doing anything new nothing's out of it

142
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:29,590
there's no kind of a box yet so I'm

143
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,789
interested in the new device because I

144
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,099
don't want USB to I don't want you as b1

145
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:37,628
there's a obviously a bottleneck there's

146
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:39,729
a bandwidth bottleneck if I have a

147
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:42,069
gigabit connection or I have some form

148
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,258
of really fast internet connection and

149
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,830
there's really old device from 2006 or 7

150
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:51,159
7 can't keep up you know can't keep up

151
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:59,590
with my bandwidth so this is why I don't

152
00:07:51,159 --> 00:08:01,180
really want this particular device so so

153
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,909
that the previous device was actually

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,099
version 2.0 this is version this is the

155
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:10,690
original version and this was also

156
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:14,460
hacked early on they figure out that in

157
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:18,849
the processor it was Intel was an Intel

158
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,109
PCX a270 it was the same processor that

159
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:22,479
was on the I don't know if you guys

160
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,310
remember the gum sticks processor the

161
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,068
gum stick border they used to sell back

162
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,870
then I mean I've been playing around

163
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:32,890
with arm for a while so I don't know if

164
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,209
you guys do remember that but you know

165
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,770
you could somewhat create your own

166
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,929
version your own homebrew version of

167
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,279
this and so people did there was a

168
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:44,949
particular seller named Andy and he used

169
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:49,089
to sell Janis PA which is basically a

170
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:52,359
version of of of this of the original

171
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,190
device but you know customized to run

172
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,740
tour

173
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,360
so you know and this is the early days

174
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,139
this is the early days of really slow

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,850
tour you know basically running whatever

176
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,980
you want to run you know whatever script

177
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,920
or ever shell script you want you know

178
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,449
basically your own portable version of

179
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,979
this and this is sort of what you know

180
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,449
what I'm looking for but not for this

181
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,750
particular version again this is the

182
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:17,939
original and this works over over you

183
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,550
know I think it's a hundred megabits so

184
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:22,920
it's not really fast again bandwidth

185
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,979
bandwidth problems I don't want it's a

186
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:32,069
really old processor too early arm five

187
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:39,050
and six I'm not interested so I'm I

188
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:41,189
think I've cover everything here ok so I

189
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:44,758
started looking around start poking

190
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:46,170
around eventually get the card I started

191
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,750
looking at what is actually running in

192
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,930
the card you know there at you know the

193
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,629
actual vendor provides the the software

194
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,519
I mean at least to some degree what we

195
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,829
partially running because what's

196
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,660
actually on the device so you or at

197
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:04,649
least the pay version not their own

198
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,139
custom software so you can see snorts

199
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,540
there and they even talk about their own

200
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:17,040
version of snort I you know if you can

201
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:20,099
see that right there was they're still

202
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:25,380
being sold on Amazon it was just me

203
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,910
trying to get more but the the idea is

204
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,040
really just trying to find out if this

205
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,839
is really Express card or just as USB

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,430
2.0 and there were no real documentation

207
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,380
I couldn't find anything about the

208
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,269
driver I couldn't really find most of

209
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,250
the stuff is really old you know I'm

210
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,630
trying to poke around trying to debug

211
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,410
something trying to see where I could

212
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,639
start and then I open it let's hook it

213
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:54,329
apart and you can see it from the bottom

214
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:56,059
the bottom slight there that it's I've

215
00:10:54,329 --> 00:11:01,219
discovered that it was really not USB

216
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:05,370
2.0 not Express card as USB 2.0 and it's

217
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,339
a USB 2.0 in a weird in a weird form

218
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,860
factor

219
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:12,189
got really pissed off I said alright

220
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,759
this this horror sucks I really don't

221
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,439
want this but I'm still interesting so

222
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,300
once I see I want to see what's inside

223
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,410
you know this probably hasn't been

224
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,069
hacked there's probably haven't been

225
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,469
open you know what's inside what's going

226
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:30,189
on and and why is it you know it's this

227
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:33,790
form fact it's just so weird I get more

228
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:36,639
information on the previous yogi the

229
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,079
yogi USB 2.0 and you know is I started

230
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,149
looking in at the end this driver for

231
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,180
Windows it works on Linux as well if you

232
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:50,680
do a virtual virtual driver has his own

233
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:53,378
specific application it it's pretty

234
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,149
interesting it creates a network just by

235
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:59,230
connecting the USB through your machine

236
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,839
just like most OTG you know USB

237
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,759
on-the-go devices nowadays though you

238
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,430
know if you plug your phone to your

239
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,199
network or to your computer instead

240
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,388
it'll network you know for Android or

241
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:15,939
wherever it is we do it will basically

242
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:19,870
do the same fact so so what I ended up

243
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:23,889
doing I modify the card connected USB 2

244
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,930
to it and I got it working on machines I

245
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:31,740
don't have Express card so you guys

246
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:41,769
could see I plugged in a jack to it

247
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:43,240
started poking around so start looking

248
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,889
more into the software was actually

249
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,319
happening what what are some of the

250
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:49,689
software that's installed there using

251
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,179
open source a lot of open source stuff

252
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:54,129
that you guys provided they have an open

253
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:57,009
source package you could download if you

254
00:12:54,129 --> 00:13:00,129
buy a particular version of the of the

255
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:03,040
device you see pictures on the bottom

256
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:04,449
there or me opening a device let's let's

257
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,730
go into that and this is the processor

258
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:14,529
for the device it's an old freescale arm

259
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:17,529
6 processor so it's a better view of the

260
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:20,150
card somewhat of my mess of me wiring

261
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:23,180
does USB plug to it

262
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:26,630
and just a better view of the card so

263
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,489
but you can see the USB OTG and this is

264
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,070
what makes this you know again this is

265
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,200
on the go USB on-the-go and this is what

266
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,820
makes this particular model work the way

267
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,279
it does where you plug it into your

268
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:44,690
computer and it becomes a network car

269
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:47,060
instantly so start poking around I see

270
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,980
the vulnerabilities for the older

271
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,900
version the the second version which is

272
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,730
you can see it on the bottom application

273
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:57,050
application one application - which is

274
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,980
the Pico and then the Pico Pro and it's

275
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,199
pretty interesting remote execution

276
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:07,420
through through its own shell through

277
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:15,680
its own you know you are all encoding

278
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:19,069
its or CGI so this is the interface this

279
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,959
is where the configuration happens is

280
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,820
where the vulnerability is and it's it's

281
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,880
been documented on the previous version

282
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,920
it's it's pretty interesting so one of

283
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,650
things I want to say is this device when

284
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,449
in his in its day it was supposed to be

285
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,790
updated by the manufacturer so the

286
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,040
manufacturer would keep updating your

287
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,719
device and will keep it up to date and

288
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,050
it will push the update anytime I went

289
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,300
online the manufacturer it's no longer

290
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,729
around there they're around whether or

291
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,780
not so it's not going to receive an

292
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,240
update when you purchase degree

293
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,670
purchases devices is going to be the

294
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,370
first probably the first version of this

295
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,030
and it's probably a vulnerable one so I

296
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,380
was testing this firmware to that of the

297
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,660
firmware that was on the USB version

298
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:17,180
just so the Roth USB they're both the

299
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:19,939
same thing so for a lot of people I

300
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,949
guess this is more of you know the

301
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,680
interesting meat of the talk it's really

302
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,589
you know shell execution you know so I

303
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,510
started triggering it's made a couple of

304
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,510
script sort of playing around with

305
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,540
just linux shell and busybox because

306
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,510
that's what's running on this particular

307
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,449
britain in this particular machine so i

308
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,060
started sending these particular

309
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,600
commands is this windows cos linux shell

310
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,020
commands you know so asterisk that

311
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:56,880
guests sign mostly all the redirect io

312
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,770
and you know if you if you open if you

313
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,420
know about linux you could run multiple

314
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:06,240
commands up ones you could send special

315
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,339
characters that would trigger particular

316
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,190
behavior within the operating system and

317
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,020
if the cgi cgi-bin actually allows it to

318
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:18,750
go through it would it would you know

319
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,400
cost some serious havoc on the on the

320
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,140
back end on the server i mean this this

321
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,209
happens today i'm a lot of servers if

322
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,220
the programmer doesn't cash the stuff it

323
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:31,680
doesn't put do a lot of just testing and

324
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,640
you know and this is for pearl I mean

325
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,620
this is CGI Ben but in in we're still

326
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,970
having this problem today for for pearl

327
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,800
and all these are the languages where

328
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,930
you have to create a filter to kind of

329
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,469
block you know special characters and

330
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:49,650
meta characters to go through the web

331
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,540
portal so that it doesn't get parse it

332
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,030
doesn't get executed and it doesn't

333
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,010
triggered the remote execution so this

334
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:03,329
is really what this talk was about I

335
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:05,940
started poking around through my script

336
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,470
I found multiple ballot validations that

337
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,970
actually worked that I was able to get

338
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:15,450
in so I was I was able to get in um I

339
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,470
want do a live demo of what it looks

340
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,470
like so

341
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:33,420
so this is Windows I do apologize so

342
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:34,050
this is a device so you could turn it on

343
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,270
and off

344
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,460
you you know but it really does it it

345
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,070
takes your traffic and it sense a

346
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,230
director to the card and it's sort of

347
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:48,510
the car starts listening in to

348
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:49,970
everything you do and it goes from it

349
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,780
creates Australia

350
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,040
the minute you plug it into your

351
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,710
computer it creates a private network

352
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,940
it's similar to poison tab from Sandy

353
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,600
come car or one of you guys are familiar

354
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:14,040
with that but none malicious this is the

355
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:16,520
protective version of it plug it on the

356
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,520
other side

357
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,600
okay

358
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,600
I had a disabled before

359
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,269
it's okay it's in my history so

360
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:35,389
but I wanted to show you first was the

361
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,070
what happens when you plug it in so when

362
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:44,830
you plug it in you see the connection as

363
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:48,800
USB 2.0 it almost is maximum speed and

364
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:50,960
so here's the MAC address of a card here

365
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,360
is the IP address that is given into and

366
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,900
this is the IP address of the little

367
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,899
tiny device

368
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,590
oh it's like the

369
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:22,090
so there is the portal for it I had

370
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,139
bridge i had logged them before but this

371
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,610
is how it looks like it might ask me for

372
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,900
credentials that's probably why it

373
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:35,290
failed but this is why I didn't really

374
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,610
want the device so this is really not do

375
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,530
you know something that I really want it

376
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,699
you know so here gives you more

377
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,830
information about what the device is

378
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,460
like what the processor is it's zero

379
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,949
number and then this is the diagnostic

380
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:52,660
portion of what I was saying where you

381
00:20:47,950 --> 00:21:03,310
are able to to run your own commands so

382
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:04,720
I will open this separately I don't want

383
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,139
to spend too much time so this is a demo

384
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,270
and I don't have that much too much time

385
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,210
the idea is basically you go here you go

386
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:17,110
to diagnostic you you you provide an IP

387
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:21,100
address and you know it sensed you to

388
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:23,530
wherever it's really not this device is

389
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,719
not really what I want to show I created

390
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,000
a simulation of this I created a bird a

391
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,010
better version of this and I've created

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,120
different versions of this particular

393
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,980
device in different in different

394
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,530
platforms so I took a look I took a

395
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,080
gander at the device and I'll show you I

396
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,879
created a script

397
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:51,300
I'll show you hopefully still open on

398
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:51,300
the window here okay

399
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,290
sorry switched from Firefox to Chrome so

400
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:10,570
but anyways I created a way we're good

401
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,900
that's how old this device is it's not

402
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,899
true

403
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:23,730
so they are among the device again if

404
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,770
you eventually get in there I created a

405
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,360
way to bypass this whole system this

406
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,220
system is really archaic it's really old

407
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,060
it's a lot of limitations now I wanted

408
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,610
to speak about some of the limitations

409
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,860
they did hardened a device enough that

410
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,419
if you try to create two input some of

411
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,969
those made it made of characters that I

412
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,650
mentioned before it would understand hey

413
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,820
you're a hacker you're trying to do

414
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,070
something that our regular usually

415
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,540
wouldn't do and I'm going to you to lock

416
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,040
the machine if you do it certain amount

417
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,980
of times and eventually you could kill

418
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,620
this little device but it has this you

419
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,920
know it does it does have a kill switch

420
00:22:51,620 --> 00:23:03,629
for other things inside internally but

421
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:05,280
anyways I created a script you know from

422
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:14,070
this group hopefully I'll be able to

423
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:17,280
show you okay perfect so this is what

424
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:23,610
that ping command looked like if you go

425
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:26,940
directly to the CGI bin for it so you

426
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:33,990
see here I've added the special

427
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:38,400
character present 0a echo % 0 9 and then

428
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,830
an HTTP requests or a SEP header that

429
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,570
allows me to run execution from the

430
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,570
device it

431
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:56,810
this is the file that I entered on the

432
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,200
device I'll switch over to my scrape

433
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,280
because this is kind of slow

434
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
that's why I created my own scrape it

435
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,930
says it's verifying every command you

436
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,340
send you know and it takes forever but

437
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:11,660
you can see it right there

438
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:14,560
it's a this is the original script and

439
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,560
it kind of looks like

440
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,750
sorry yeah it kind of looks a little

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,750
different than this

442
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:48,990
I guess there it is so this is this is

443
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:53,149
my skirt so if you could see here I've

444
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:56,850
taken that whatever inputs coming from

445
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,190
the HTTP request and I'm saving it to a

446
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,889
file if you can see it there obscenity

447
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:08,280
to a file and it's in that file dumping

448
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:13,410
both the both my basically shell input

449
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:16,050
but also the error and the the return of

450
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:20,670
what of an echo basically the output of

451
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:23,220
the shell the standard output so I will

452
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:33,360
give it a command other than what I just

453
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:39,590
gave it so that the Vice is running s

454
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,590
route natively

455
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:58,240
gets it in an intro I'll just show you

456
00:25:50,950 --> 00:26:01,210
from here so that's everything that's

457
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,100
running you know and basically I have

458
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,780
full access to the device and I could

459
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,580
see I could look at all the script and

460
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:11,860
like a look I mean that's me right there

461
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:14,260
obviously that I hacked but there's a

462
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,810
lot of firewall rules you could you

463
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,520
could be basically Bob's your uncle here

464
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,310
you could basically do whatever you want

465
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,000
it has port knocking and has snored it

466
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:29,639
has different versions of this you know

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:34,180
really old arcade box busy box

468
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:37,960
implementation and again this is this is

469
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,500
kind of you know this is really not what

470
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,420
the talk is about so I wanted to create

471
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,770
something very much like this I wanted

472
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,630
to create something that's customized

473
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,580
and personalized for myself that I could

474
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,140
run basically snore I could run some of

475
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,060
the devices that are running on here I

476
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:58,690
could run my own antivirus you're my own

477
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:01,230
you know anti-spoofing and plug it to my

478
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,320
device and I said well white you know

479
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:08,490
it's 2018 like there's tons of arm

480
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,490
devices that could do this

481
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,530
okay so I modified our Raspberry Pi to

482
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,409
do basically the same idea of what this

483
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:29,899
device is doing and so i use i mentioned

484
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:34,070
before i use the sammy camp cars hack

485
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:38,980
instead of creating my own industry ver

486
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:41,419
to create a a USB portable card I

487
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,630
basically just dump all the traffic

488
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,210
directly to the Raspberry Pi and my

489
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,520
traffic gets analyzed like I send my

490
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,940
traffic to tour it communicates through

491
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,660
the Wi-Fi access or whatever Wi-Fi card

492
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,820
I want to put in there so I want to get

493
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,590
something higher-end more powerful I

494
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,260
could you know I could definitely get

495
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,350
better reception I could do a lot more

496
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,960
than that little card was was doing you

497
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:13,040
know this is quad-core arm seven and

498
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,800
this is in fact arm eight the latest

499
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,940
Raspberry Pi that has a higher clock

500
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,879
higher clock and better better

501
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,300
performance overall but you know I

502
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,040
implement it and I'm trying to create an

503
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,570
operating system for it you know and

504
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,879
that's one of the things I want to get

505
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,110
it done before the talk and I couldn't I

506
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,000
couldn't get it I couldn't get

507
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,429
everything in there but it's basically

508
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,780
the same idea of what this device is

509
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:45,050
doing and then I said you know why stop

510
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,149
in a room you know whereas berry pie you

511
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:52,210
know I at first I had some limitations I

512
00:28:47,150 --> 00:29:00,320
had to remove the raspberry PI's hub

513
00:28:52,210 --> 00:29:08,960
which it's a pain in the bud you can see

514
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:11,330
it here so this is basically the the

515
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,180
lighting is from light source in the

516
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,460
back of the Raspberry Pi and I created

517
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:22,790
the same the same thing I plugged you

518
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:26,210
know I USB connection to it mini mini

519
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,780
USB so I had to find a tracing for the

520
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,670
Raspberry Pi to bypass the hub

521
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,560
so eventually you know coorporate

522
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,600
whatever Wi-Fi access I wanted to put in

523
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,570
there or whatever card or whatever the

524
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,129
Vice and and so here would you see the

525
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,260
logo for the Raspberry Pi that's where

526
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,170
actually where the is basically be

527
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,810
marked for you so the two dots right on

528
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:53,110
top of the Raspberry Pi logo it's it's

529
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:56,050
the is the hub and here you will see jj3

530
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,550
is basically the the opposite side going

531
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,700
directly straight to this to the seat

532
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,700
CPU you'll probably see it in the next

533
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,260
slide but the whole idea is well I could

534
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,150
I could do with the Raspberry Pi but I

535
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,940
can also do a go to restroom part W it

536
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,860
is more portable it has less processing

537
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,280
power but it's the same idea eventually

538
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:19,870
I kept going this is some of the slide

539
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:22,990
from the presentation before but

540
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,510
eventually I went into you know USB 3

541
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,440
and I said well I want higher

542
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:37,270
performance I want you know better

543
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:43,960
bandwidth I kind of got there so this is

544
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:45,879
the the raw 64 this is the it hazards b3

545
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,680
is probably one of the cheapest models

546
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,690
that exist today that you could buy

547
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,190
maybe less than $40 on on Amazon and

548
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,920
what allowed to do the same thing one of

549
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:02,380
the things that that I came across was

550
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:04,770
the the OTG goes from usb to or from

551
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,150
years b3 2 USB 2 so then I realized well

552
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,840
my bandwidth is being limited you know

553
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,420
so I wouldn't further and I started

554
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,699
messing around with the the Tegra the

555
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,350
Tegra x1 which is inside the this is how

556
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,050
you get a regular by the way this is how

557
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,699
you would you go from a micro to a

558
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,389
regular USB this is how you implement a

559
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:31,570
Wi-Fi card but this is only working on

560
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:37,240
USB 2 but as I was saying I eventually

561
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:40,030
went into a into the shield and from the

562
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,820
shield I was able to run my own version

563
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,090
of Linux with my own moti

564
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:49,159
basically USB on-the-go and and I was

565
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,929
able to do the same the same the same

566
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,940
thing I was able to do it on Android

567
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:56,990
with a root and Android to eventually

568
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,240
jailbreak the device to potentially do

569
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,820
it on another device and I was looking

570
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,600
for another version of a cheaper version

571
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:09,379
because a Nvidia shield about 179 dollar

572
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,179
device eventually found something much

573
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:17,480
better I found something called the

574
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:20,140
arcade 33 33 99 in the $33.99 I have to

575
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,140
find that

576
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:49,500
okay that's what here again sorry is

577
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:51,810
Windows sorry for my slides so they have

578
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,270
their own Linux distro and you could

579
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,429
compile it and make sickly use this

580
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,720
particular device to to create the same

581
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:05,790
thing this is what's inside a device so

582
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:08,880
is USB USB 3 the same capabilities under

583
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:10,800
$100 you know you could attach it to the

584
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,080
back of your computer to eventually do

585
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,020
this in it has built-in Wi-Fi it has the

586
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,270
same capabilities that's you know

587
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:22,260
there's the Nvidia shield that's the t1

588
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,970
would have so I kept looking there's a

589
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,550
development board from China there's a

590
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:30,780
it's it's it's just as cheap as this

591
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:33,060
particular device but the idea is to

592
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,860
basically get your gets to this are

593
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,419
thinking so there's a lot of

594
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:41,580
customizations there's a lot of things

595
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,980
that happen with arm and USB 3 and

596
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:48,480
devices that are able to go basically do

597
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,490
on-the-go would USB 3 and it's very it's

598
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,260
very powerful you could create your own

599
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,840
network you own private you know

600
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,020
firewall your antivirus protection all

601
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,030
in a separate machine than the one that

602
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,830
you're running you know for example

603
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,350
there's Windows machine and be

604
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,600
constantly protected you don't you know

605
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,659
an attacker will have to bypass and

606
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,370
attack the original device the the one

607
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,899
is connected to the Wi-Fi that giving

608
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,449
you access and is routing your traffic

609
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,800
and most like is going through tor or or

610
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,449
is going through whatever script you

611
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,010
want to create and this is why I want to

612
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,960
create an operating system to eventually

613
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,480
you know harness the power of our

614
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,670
particular chip for a particular

615
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,110
firmware and and basically put it out

616
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,180
there as a product it's something that

617
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,520
you could use and you create something

618
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,589
with and play with it becomes more like

619
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,780
a platform similar to you know an

620
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,760
Arduino or even the Raspberry Pi that

621
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,460
you see here and that's the idea that's

622
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,990
sort of creating something in the middle

623
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,179
that it don't only communicate all the

624
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,529
communication for you is protecting you

625
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,399
at the same time and it's building you

626
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,609
from viruses from

627
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,949
from fishing from spine from any kind of

628
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:54,480
attacks any kind of vectors that you

629
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,450
know could attack your particular

630
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,130
Windows machine or Linux machine or

631
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,140
whatever is on the other side and you

632
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,999
could attach this to a router you know

633
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,970
through the same OTG they have a

634
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:08,819
secondary point of a vector so that if

635
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,410
they're doing you know through the on

636
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:15,180
the public side on the antenna side

637
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:17,190
they're doing a just basically an

638
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,210
identity of what devices actually

639
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,279
connect to the internet

640
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,049
they'll have to really go through

641
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:25,680
certain loops to try to get to attack

642
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:28,559
that particular router so that's

643
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,879
basically the the concept it's you could

644
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:36,480
create your own high-end network

645
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:41,609
appliance running on somewhat high-end

646
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,890
equipment in 2018 and be completely to

647
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,450
the point where an attacker might not

648
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,160
know what you're actually using if this

649
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,569
is a Windows device or you know you

650
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,788
could you could hide the porch you could

651
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:54,799
you could even implement a honey spot a

652
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:57,809
honeypot right on the actual device and

653
00:35:54,799 --> 00:36:00,450
most like know be the wiser so one of

654
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,960
the things that I'm trying to do is to

655
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:06,960
create a form of standardization there's

656
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,059
there's a lot of problems with the

657
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,249
processors and in certain linux

658
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,499
libraries they're not available for

659
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:16,169
certain processors that haven't been

660
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:21,238
ported over to arm issues with

661
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:23,460
compatibility just all around just linux

662
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:27,029
problems that i'm trying to provide a

663
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,289
distro and you know basically we'll be

664
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:29,579
the first ones to basically know that

665
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,839
i'm creating something like this I don't

666
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,809
know weathers are working or something

667
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:36,480
similar to this but it's a starting

668
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:39,869
point it's some it's a platform you know

669
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,180
that could become the next pineapple you

670
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:45,359
know you know from hack 5 or or

671
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,038
something better you know I mean so you

672
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,538
could you could think of it well you

673
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,279
know the pineapple is probably doing the

674
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,950
same thing or something similar to Wi-Fi

675
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:56,220
you know why wouldn't it do that to

676
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,328
protect you instead of attack you know

677
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,848
instead of using it as an attack vector

678
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:01,200
when I use it as a form of protection a

679
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:03,569
form of

680
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,980
putting something in between you and and

681
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,720
the internet and the rest of you know

682
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,619
all these other attack vectors that are

683
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,839
out there out there so you know that's

684
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:16,049
that's my idea poke around find out

685
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,130
what's what's out there find out you

686
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:20,040
know you could create your own version

687
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:24,240
of this and and get your feelers out you

688
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,380
know get your this is the this is what

689
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm working on right now this is the

690
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,150
Nvidia shield with the Tegra with the

691
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,540
Tegra processor the circuit processor is

692
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,980
probably one of the fastest armed

693
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,259
devices in the market right now there's

694
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:46,099
nothing as powerful as this device it

695
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:49,079
has 24 GPU cores you know it has eight

696
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:51,780
eight ARM cores on its own for that are

697
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,400
specifically accessible to you and then

698
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,650
another four there arnaud that are

699
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:01,290
basically big brother or big little

700
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:04,170
configuration not big brother so this is

701
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:05,849
this is what the Tegra development board

702
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,160
looks like and this is a little more

703
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,960
more expensive this is about four

704
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,390
hundred dollars to sort of play around

705
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,240
with it but it's very capable it's it's

706
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,270
a it's a very powerful machine it could

707
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,890
make a really powerful tablet I know

708
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,670
Google made our tablet base head it is

709
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:25,650
and and obviously the the shield not the

710
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,510
shield is switch the Nintendo switch is

711
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,680
running on this platform so they've

712
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:34,380
they've shown different vulnerabilities

713
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,009
and different attacks to try to bypass

714
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,660
the bootloader for for the Nintendo

715
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,950
shield version of this and you could

716
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,598
eventually turn your Intel no shield

717
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,629
into one of those devices that I

718
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,579
mentioned so that's basically my goal if

719
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,230
you already own something you know you

720
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,510
already have the hardware if you already

721
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:54,660
are playing with armed devices you're

722
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,400
already playing with Linux and you

723
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,259
already have the capabilities of

724
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,869
programming and creating something new

725
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,160
this is this is basically what I you

726
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,290
know I want to get that started I want

727
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,779
to start perhaps working with people you

728
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:09,058
know creating a platform creating a way

729
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:13,140
tool to kind of work on this together to

730
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:14,970
kind of get your hands dirty and and get

731
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,040
some serious collaboration

732
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,589
create some serious protection you know

733
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,910
for yourself you know forget about the

734
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,250
rest of the world I mean eventually

735
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,589
could it could trickle down but for

736
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,240
yourself you could create even a tag

737
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,930
vectors from it by creating a form of

738
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:35,370
protection this is a very powerful Linux

739
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:38,100
machine the Nvidia community has a huge

740
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:40,290
following behind this as development

741
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,390
boards as I just showed you there's

742
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,360
there's a little early distro

743
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,589
specifically for the Tegra 4 the Tegra

744
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:53,400
x1 the this machine is very very

745
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:55,920
powerful and this is where I want to

746
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,420
create the distro I want to start with

747
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,850
this because this is the highest the

748
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:06,930
Hyatt the higher end and kind of go down

749
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:10,500
from there and it's a very capable not

750
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:12,000
just for protection but you could use

751
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,420
this you should use the encryption or

752
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,650
you could use the the GPU to do cracking

753
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:21,510
to do password cracking while you're

754
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,570
searching the web you know you could do

755
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:27,150
crypto crypto mining as well it's a very

756
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:29,910
powerful machine that you could adapt it

757
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:33,650
to pretty much anything I have it on me

758
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:38,670
here it's not bigger than my hand

759
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:40,890
it's a very it has two USB 3 ports that

760
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,980
are allow you to plug in whatever device

761
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:47,310
you want and it has the on the go it

762
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,600
basically it's a portable computer I

763
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,549
mean you could attach this to the back

764
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:54,600
of your laptop but our USB 3 cable and

765
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,260
no one would know them no one would be

766
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,910
the wiser

767
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,730
I know what you're doing and you know

768
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,560
why is there and again it has the same

769
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,600
Wi-Fi capabilities it could connect on

770
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,220
your behalf it could create a private

771
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,970
network between you and your computer

772
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,279
and send your traffic's and your traffic

773
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,810
through tor automatically through a

774
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,910
separate device instead of using your

775
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:23,370
machine it's it's it's a great platform

776
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:25,410
um I hope you guys got something from

777
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,750
this or you can start working on this

778
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,710
and perhaps you know help me create

779
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,200
something or

780
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:35,040
something for yourself I will be putting

781
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,848
the distro on github after the talk

782
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,009
it's private right now but basically uh

783
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:43,500
just to show you some of the problems

784
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,270
and it's just some of the debugging

785
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,900
perhaps you could start a small

786
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:51,150
community similar to the dd-wrt or open

787
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,589
wrt when you know a lot of these devices

788
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:58,589
first came to to the surface that's

789
00:41:55,589 --> 00:42:12,779
basically my talk you guys have any

790
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:14,490
questions what's the power draw you're

791
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,849
seeing is it getting powered from the

792
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:22,080
laptop over USB then well it depends on

793
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:23,970
the device so the arcade $33.99 there I

794
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,490
wanna mentioned the second cheapest

795
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:28,529
version of this it could it could draw

796
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,720
from your from your device but it

797
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,130
depends on the laptop so if you have one

798
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,649
of the new laptops that could provide

799
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:37,160
the higher USB 3 power it will provide

800
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:40,260
it it will provide the higher end power

801
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:45,589
is basically power and data through one

802
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,589
cable and you're good to go

803
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,920
any other questions

804
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:01,589
the OS is really tiny it's it's about

805
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:06,570
the size of a busy box or something to

806
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:09,660
that you know it's a better extent hi

807
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:15,150
hey I had a question if this is the same

808
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:17,399
target as the the Asus thicker boards

809
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:21,119
using the rock 64 that when I mentioned

810
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,780
that before and that OTG goes from USB 3

811
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,990
2 USB toe and it's just part of the

812
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,960
manufacturer they build a cheaper chip

813
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,839
that could basically do the same as the

814
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,460
one I mentioned but is a lesser it's a

815
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,450
lesser purpose kind it's not the same it

816
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,790
doesn't work it doesn't have the same

817
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,828
function so yeah that the ticker box it

818
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:43,890
has a similar check but not that one has

819
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:46,140
this the rock 64 that that board that I

820
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:50,578
mentioned that I purchased that

821
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:54,720
basically left me down so so in terms of

822
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:57,000
issues with open wrt DVI Verity I know

823
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,669
that that the community the open wrt

824
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,780
communities struggling to get a sustain

825
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:07,410
good board and probably the Firefly here

826
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,940
donated the Firefly it's the same chip

827
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,460
but it's it's configured in a whole

828
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,200
different way the configuration is very

829
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,349
different from the raw 64 from the

830
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,970
tinker board it's it's in such a way

831
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:20,910
that you need a special you boot

832
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,549
configuration for the flood for that

833
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:25,368
particular board and there's not a lot

834
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,510
of support just things may have a china

835
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:29,220
the guys in China are probably taking

836
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,130
their time kind of importing some of the

837
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,410
things that the rockchip has created on

838
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,170
there you're better off creating your

839
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:39,598
completely own kernel from rock trip and

840
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:43,589
implementing all the patches that could

841
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,619
make this work for you but yeah thank

842
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,619
you

843
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,019
