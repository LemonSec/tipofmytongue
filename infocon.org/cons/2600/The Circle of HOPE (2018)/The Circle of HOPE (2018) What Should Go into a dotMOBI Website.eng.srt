action to follow when you break out of

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,030
these webpage you could press one of

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,680
those members particularly whenever you

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,850
want to go to number one Friday's

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,880

phone

37
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:44,660
I'm going to page 12 / 0 7 - 20 which is

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:49,220
the directory under 812 where I have

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:52,150
is index.htm there should be a circle

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,150
for logo here

41
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,530
now you notice that had a.m. 2:00 p.m.

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,630
with the various hours of schedule and

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,640
reason to this is about did you have an

44
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,370
older people with a bike weight

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,679
indicator you can simply navigate to be

46
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,440
that where you want click on that hour

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,530
in this case northern a.m. and they're

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,620
on Friday at 1100 hours in the Ricci

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,410
room we find the Cheshire catalyst what

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,760
should we do they dozen will be website

51
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,560
that wouldn't it be interesting if you

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,410
could just click on this and find a

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,630
notice magicians talk I can't put that

54
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,910
online whether you're looking at your

55
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,410
phone and attempt this page you should

56
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,620
be able to click on that and actually

57
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,620
read

58
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:48,940
so back to my box directory and go to

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,970
Chester dot HTML this is where we should

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,060
be on the screen from the net but we

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,099
don't have what access code we're

62
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,950
probably my mother should explain my

63
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:03,810
mother wedding from do it's pretty to

64
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:07,660
fake it and that's what I'm doing here

65
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:11,230
so while the tunnel will go back out to

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:18,608
the actual hope that that website to the

67
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:20,469
speaker page and we have Winkler speaker

68
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,440
will take to the regular of that next

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,400
speakers page I'll show you my certify

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:32,919
of their s now and simply say that I

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,840
don't like apps apps require to have a

72
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,139
certain operating system usually it's

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,549
either the iOS operating system or the

74
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,009
Android operating system

75
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,580
on your phone why should I look each of

76
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,530
it if you have an older feature phone

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,780
say a Nokia with their proprietary

78
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,090
operating system but they have a web

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,770
browser you should still be able to get

80
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:59,099
the information you're looking for

81
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,099
that's bad capable websites and apps

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,960
apologize by the way I work best with

83
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:29,389
questions feel free to swear questions

84
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:33,680
everything ten o'clock web pages versus

85
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:35,570
that what is a Tod a top-level domain in

86
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,300
this case that would be portion of the

87
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:43,310
web address I like to see these days

88
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:46,669
that monkey is the dot-com for mobile

89
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,520
phone browsers and mobile devices right

90
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,859
mobile phones and tablets they both fall

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:06:04,159
into that of course you bring up a house

92
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:07,310
both we're doing here and you'll see

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:20,840
that as I slide back and forth that the

94
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:23,389
text will slide around those are not

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,979
necessarily obsolete phones different

96
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,660
has a web browser they should be able to

97
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:52,880
read you're with me now what composers

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:55,250
do that guest has set up your web

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,380
browser and you can send an email just

100
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,880
by clicking on the address in a web page

101
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,949
well the TEL allows you to find a

102
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,880
telephone number with the same kind of

103
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,800
format te l : and the number in this

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,099
case I've got the phone number two zero

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,130
two seven six two one four zero one if

106
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,719
you click on this with a desktop browser

107
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,580
it'll probably say I don't know how to

108
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,639
deal with it unless you've installed

109
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,530
Skype on your computer

110
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,210
Skype has gone in and has updated the

111
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,770
web browser so that would it sees a

112
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,890
telephone number it will try and bring

113
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,940
up Skype I think my article in 2600 may

114
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,340
have helped them figure out how to do

115
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,229
that a couple of years ago so hopefully

116
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,780
I was the one that pushed that snowball

117
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:43,669
down the hill when you click on these it

118
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,440
will go to your well it may ask you

119
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:49,609
which application in your phone do you

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,159
want just tap on phone send and up will

121
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,229
come Durward Kirby the former announcer

122
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:57,110
of Garry Moore's I've got a secret

123
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,300
television program who was recorded by

124
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,400
the US Naval Observatory and is the

125
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,469
voice of the naval observatories master

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,450
clock he will read you the time in

127
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,460
Eastern Daylight or Eastern Standard

128
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:12,919
depending on time of year and in

129
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:15,049
Universal Time coordinated UTC is an

130
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,700
abbreviation that is inconvenient in

131
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,289
both English and French and so it was

132
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,719
agreed upon also I've tend to like the

133
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,360
International Date format of year month

134
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,340
day hour minute second because not only

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,070
is that human readable it's computers

136
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,710
sortable it's a nerd thing I understand

137
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,649
that

138
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,949
know that I'm a licensed nerd ham radio

139
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,380
license and 4sc why by the way there

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,560
will be a ham examination on Sunday

141
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,410
afternoon at noon today they're giving

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,880
you tips on how to get past the exam up

143
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,589
on the 6th floor I think it's the

144
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Budapest room but you can find out and

145
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:53,279
how I suggest taking the test getting

146
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,170
those hand license and getting out of

147
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,870
the year much fun lots of interesting

148
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:04,829
people too now when I set up various

149
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:09,810
menus for example at the bottom of most

150
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:12,149
pages let's see like at the bottom of

151
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,180
the schedule page where we have one two

152
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:20,730
and three there is a component in the H

153
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:26,189
reference for the access key access key

154
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:28,770
equals quote one and so when people tap

155
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,220
the one on their touch-tone dial or if

156
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,589
you hit ctrl alt one on your desktop

157
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:39,029
keyboard it will then trip that access

158
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:41,370
key and send you to that web webpage so

159
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,290
the axis key allows somebody with a

160
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,190
mobile phone browser who's looking at a

161
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,900
website to choose menu choices if you

162
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:54,930
visit yn 61b

163
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,990
yn is for Yuri's Night 1961 is the year

164
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,260
Yuri Gagarin achieved orbit as the first

165
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,440
human in space and if you go through

166
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,510
that menu tree you hit I think it's four

167
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,610
for North America within they have three

168
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,330
for United States and then I had a

169
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,310
problem

170
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,380
fifty states plus the sort of

171
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,750
territories how could I get that down to

172
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,160
a zero to nine menu choice so you could

173
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,650
just push a button on the touch tone

174
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,920
dial on an older feature phone hmm let

175
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,250
me see the question becomes what is the

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,140
first digit of your zip code and that

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,990
then becomes a zero to nine menu choice

178
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,439
the second page of that is the states or

179
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,060
territories within that group for the

180
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,250
number one you'd have Delaware

181
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,630
Pennsylvania and New York for the number

182
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,070
two you'd have DC Virginia etc etc and

183
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,279
that was one easy way of dealing with

184
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:55,560
that

185
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:58,709
problem oh let me see now so that's the

186
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,050
tell tag oh the text tag if you want to

187
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,189
text cheshire send me a text message

188
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,859
while you're on this page you can click

189
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:07,680
on that it will it should ask you which

190
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,319
app again on how many apps you have for

191
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,239
text messaging and just choose one it

192
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,479
will drop my telephone number into the

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,279
send area and ask for your email address

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,480
so I can email you back when you send me

195
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,129
the text message you've got the body

196
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,370
component I believe there's the subject

197
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:28,259
component and these are ways of being

198
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,350
able to put these sorts of things into a

199
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,569
webpage that somebody coming in on their

200
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,879
mobile phone will be able to access and

201
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:40,889
interact with your page and with you now

202
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:44,939
fav icon is the next little subject I'd

203
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,160
like to cover when you bring up a

204
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,059
webpage these days you'll find that

205
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,980
there's a tab at the top of the page and

206
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,480
besides the title of the page very

207
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,250
important because when you bookmark a

208
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,889
page that title becomes the title of the

209
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,769
bookmark it will usually also grab

210
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:07,740
whatever is your fav icon f AV

211
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:10,319
ICO n dot ICO now the best way to

212
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,629
prepare a fav icon is to take your

213
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:17,370
favorite image bring it up in paint and

214
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:22,500
save it as a bitmap it helps if it's a

215
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:24,360
square shape and let's see you cope

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,040
you're not on the net I can't bring up

217
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,860
my usual displays that I had planned to

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:34,319
bringing up but at icons to go dot u.s.

219
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,089
you'll find my page for coming up with

220
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:39,449
icons for myself and for other people

221
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,939
and it's a great way of coming up with

222
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:44,160
icons yourself just like I said bring

223
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:47,370
them into paint save them as a bitmap

224
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:53,100
and then remit renamed the dot BMP file

225
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:55,279
as dot ICO just FTP that image into the

226
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,280
main index directory of your website

227
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,250
you're done

228
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,260
the web browsers then take over and when

229
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,500
they bring in a web page they look for a

230
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,110
fav icon if they find it that little

231
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,050
image goes up in the tab and when you

232
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,360
bookmark the page that goes in with a

233
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,390
bookmark to identify the bookmark if you

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,560
tell your device save this webpage to my

235
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:22,270
main screen that icon becomes the icon

236
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,130
on the main screen so you can find it

237
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:29,140
among all the other icons you have on

238
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:34,210
your main screen if you've visited the

239
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:36,520
h-12 dot mobi and hits the three dots in

240
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,030
the upper right hand corner and find the

241
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,699
save to my home page you'll find a small

242
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,329
icon of the hope logo that will now

243
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,920
appear on the home page of your phone so

244
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:53,500

245
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,540
easily now in Brevard County Florida

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,170
where I'm at I got roped into webmaster

247
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:05,349
in a page called museums of Brevard org

248
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:08,199

249
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,589
for a museum that becomes a icons with

250
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,780
that coppa dot Moby if you look at that

251
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:17,190
website that was well I have to explain

252
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,540
about copepod Moby I am a soccer fan

253
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,610
when I was stationed in Germany with the

254
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,640
US Army I went to a soccer match while I

255
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,560
was there standing ninety minutes into

256
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,140
the southwest corner of the

257
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,469
Kaiserslautern Football Club stadium

258
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,439
with the rowdy crowd I didn't know that

259
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,080
they were called vuvuzelas at the time

260
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,839
but they were there I had to wait until

261
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,580
the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to

262
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,670
find out what they were called but I

263
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,770
remember them but it was at that soccer

264
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,620
match I realized soccer was the world's

265
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,110
game so in 1993 I live near Orlando

Numbering plan administration showing

333
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,210

334
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,490
is I asked for it

335
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,840
they approved it doesn't that mean it's

336
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,190
my area code but I share but I did save

337
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,199
the best number for myself

338
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:12,660

344
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,800
can take a look at how I've done museums

345
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:33,780
at Brevard dot org which is available on

346
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:37,080
of this notes page here basically I wish

347
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,810
I could bring it up it has the name and

348
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,830
address of the museum and an image and

349
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,790
then the next line there swapped around

350
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,649
name address and then the image type

351
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,180
news site and then they just alternate

352
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,120
down the page it's about the only thing

353
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:54,000
I do for graphics considering and then

354
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,360
in between those two frames give me

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,740
cells of the table I've got the location

356
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,080
and any icons for social media that they

357
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:09,960
have twitter facebook what-have-you and

358
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,850
the map icon for what three words now I

359
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,900
would like to promote what three words

360
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:23,039
dot-com their short address is w3w Co if

361
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:25,679
you bring that up click on

362
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,019
explore the map and then click on the

363
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,929
usual my location symbol it will find

364
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:33,450
you it will come up with three simple

365
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:36,000
words separated by dots that you can

366
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,679
give to anyone else and they can then

367
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,769
find where you're at by those three

368
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:44,399
words you can tap on the image there and

369
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:46,409
hits the sheer symbol and send it by a

370
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,629
text messaging or email or what have you

371
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:49,919
and so if you're both going to be in

372
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:54,240
Central Park you just don't know where

373
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,970
the one person goes to w3w CEO go to the

374
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,789
map find what it finds where you are

375
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:03,210
share that by a text message and then

376
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,860
your friend can tap on the received URL

377
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,379
which will then show them where in the

378
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,229
park you are and you can use that to

379
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:13,139
find yourself and get together in

380
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:18,029
strange locations like that I highly

381
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:28,049
recommend that let's see contact icons

382
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:32,580
again the let me see if I can bring up

383
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:36,149
my icons page icons to go dot us which

384
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,189
is the web address for that just the

385
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:48,570
image district I didn't transport all of

386
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:53,059
us over no my apologies I saved some

387
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,059
simple icons for use on the page

388
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:05,080
we'll do it Instagram logos yeah that

389
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:07,418
was that there you will be just for what

390
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:12,090
the Wikipedia logo for some people off

391
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,090
to those let's see what else I've got

392
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,669
Coppa duck Moby

393
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,000
this was the main logo of the World Cup

394
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:31,449
which was as if Faberge had designed the

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,430
World Cup trophy and then these are the

396
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,940
lists of 32 nations that were in this

397
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,940
year's World Cup

398
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,110
unfortunately the flags are not coming

399
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,050
up because it's set up to go to the net

400
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,429
to grab the flags the group letters if

401
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,139
you're familiar with the World Cup at

402
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,560
all the 32 nations are grouped into

403
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,450
eight groups of four teams each each

404
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:01,360
teams plays the other three times

405
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:03,840
there's three matches per group play in

406
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,840
Group A

407
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:20,850
slash groups /a okay will not go through

408
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,970
that now but the entire page is

409
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,610
formatted completely for the mobile

410
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,140
phone web browser to be able to view

411
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,580
what you see as squares with the

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,200
three-letter codes for the country's

413
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,179
should be showing you the flags of those

414
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,650
countries the three letters are actually

415
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,720
in the alt of the image tag the numbers

416
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,270
on the left hand side are the matched

417
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,890
numbers the reason I have to use the

418
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,960
match numbers is because down at the

419
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,800
round of 6 will be on the rounded 16 in

420
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:53,670
the quarterfinals you'll see w 49 vs w

421
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,470
50 the winner of match 49 plays the

422
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,050
winner of match 50 which in this case

423
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,900
was org y vs. France and France won that

424
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:04,320
one to nil so as long as I needed to

425
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,580
have the match number Saudi knew which

426
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,830
ones we were talking about

427
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:12,090
I put matched numbers for alongside each

428
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:14,490
and every match and what I did was if

429
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,760
you click on the actual number it will

430
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,290
take you out to FIFA World Cup com to

431
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,270
that particular match so you could to

432
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,460
look up the details but again we're not

433
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,100
on the net here so we can't do that but

434
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,840
for those of you surfing at home you can

435
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,780
follow along on that oh there's a couple

436
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,639
of the flags Sweden in England

437
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,399
I must have actually worked on this one

438
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,420
for the editing and put them into this

439
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:43,110
particular version our archives include

440
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:45,630
the 2014 World Cup in Brazil the 2015

441
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,659
Women's World Cup and the 2017

442
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,610
Confederation Cup now before the Men's

443
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,040
World Cup every four years the year

444
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,649
before that FIFA runs the Confederation

445
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,060
Cup to test the stadiums so that the

446
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:03,350
local organizing committee can figure

447
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:08,780
out actually how to run a World Cup I

448
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,780
think this pretty much concludes my talk

449
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:15,240
[Music]

450
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,240
do I have any other questions out there

451
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,990
okay what's that

452
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:41,280
well most HTML tags will work on phone

453
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,390
browsers because they're usually

454
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,658
stripped-down versions of desktop

455
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,799
browsers so no to do most things the

456
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,570
thing is that some things didn't get

457
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,750
translated from phones up to the desktop

458
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,408
browsers like the TEL tag that's why

459
00:24:52,750 --> 00:25:03,610
Skype had to go and do something strange

460
00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:04,960
once I showed them how and any questions

461
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,289
on these please feel free to drop me an

462
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,610
email

463
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:12,190
cheshire at pH to mobiie phone friendly

464
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:16,780
is the website with pH is on both words

465
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:21,370
and the short form is for phone friendly

466
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,500
is pH 2 dot mo bi so coming up with

467
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,600
shorter versions of your main domain

468
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,870
name can be useful for people who come

469
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,230
in from mobile phone web sites on their

470
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,928
mobile phones also it makes for shorter

471
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,190
email address so usually when I give out

472
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,470
the address it's with the dot mobi

473
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:45,640
rather than phone friendly comma takes a

474
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:46,900
lot to type out so yeah I'm sure I would

475
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,169
have remembered other things to bring up

476
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,890
had I had the full website available I

477
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:52,890
apologize for that

478
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,369
[Music]

479
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:04,210
the hope overview will that that's going

480
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:13,260
out to the net as well so let me see if

481
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:13,260
I can drop back a few characters about

482
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,830
HTML

483
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:26,410
or was it just HTM nope not on this one

484
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:31,299
did didn't edit this file on this

485
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:33,309
machine around this thumb drive so thank

486
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:35,168
you very much for your time and I'll be

487
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,520
around for any questions you may still

488
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:38,520
have after the talk thank you

489
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,980
[Applause]
