1
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,020
thank you everyone I know there's

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,969
absolutely nothing better to do at nine

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,219
o'clock on Saturday night in New York

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,990
then come to a talk about patents so

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,640
yeah so I'm an attorney at the

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,830
Electronic Frontier Foundation my full

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,689
title is senior staff attorney and Mark

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,139
Cuban chair to eliminate stupid patents

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,960
that is actually my job title my Cuban

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,460
supports patent work even though he

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,470
doesn't agree with everything the F F

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,010
does he also thinks there are a lot of

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,950
stupid patents we do a variety of things

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,570
on patent policy we litigate we've

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,579
challenged patents we challenged a

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,250
patent on we challenged a software

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,210
patent on podcasting that had been used

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,610
to threaten podcasters and actually got

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,770
that pattern and validated and ended up

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,120
going all the way to petitioning an

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,770
appeal on the Supreme Court which we

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,190
want about three or four weeks ago now

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,280
thank you

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:09,810
we also do like regulatory submissions

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,030
we blog and and we we go to Congress and

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,830
try and get them to either do good

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,680
things or not do bad things and I'll get

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,479
a get to some of that towards the end of

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,080
this talk but this talk is really going

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,360
to focus on a series we have the stupid

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,820
patent of the month that we have to

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,020
highlight problems with with software

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,429
patents there are a lot of problems with

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,979
the Patent Office that we will start to

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,530
get into in more detail and it's been

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,299
kind of an educational process it's good

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,140
for us to have the discipline to write

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,909
every week and we focus on on software

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,759
patents which is what because of the

40
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,320
sort of digital mission of vff but

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,930
before we get to software patents I

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,839
wanted to share with you some of my very

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,530
favorite stupid patents so let's go to

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,740
the method of swinging on a swing this

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,890
is not a joke this is a real patent that

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:11,519
issued I was filed for in 2002 it was I

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:15,959
was by I was filed by the child of a

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,700
patent a prosecutor who had a kid who

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,950
was very excited about finding a new way

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,869
to swing side to side on a regular swing

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,700
and helped his kid file this patent

52
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,970
application it was issued they got a lot

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,959
of bad press I mean really like what

54
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:37,890
like it is it is it's kind of silly

55
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:41,910
patent but not a software patent but

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,059
still you know what so this is one of my

57
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,010
personal favorites the user operated

58
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,489
amusement apparatus for kicking the

59
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,649
users products this was and you might

60
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,480
think like it's kind of it's amusing

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,400
like you know this is the real machine

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,590
maybe this isn't isn't that stupid a

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,390
patent but I I still think really no

64
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,420
matter how deep into the sort of white

65
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,119
of the patent system that that there's

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,379
always more sort of what to be had and

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,450
like I earned this patent it at talks

68
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,909
did before and someone came up to me and

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,310
said you know there's one of these on a

70
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,109
road in South Carolina between you know

71
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,640
some town and the beach it's like a

72
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,930
tourist thing and I was like oh that's

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,220
interesting I wonder if it's like the

74
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,659
actual patentee and I looked into it and

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,970
it's a machine that that this is this

76
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,700
this was on the road and you burn it's

77
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,250
from 1937 and you know this is this a

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,530
patent that was issued in 2000 so you

79
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,959
know there were knee like about 63 years

80
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,790
after the machine existed someone

81
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,920
decided to patent it which you know

82
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,079
shows that the Patent Office is not

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,599
always the best at finding

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,510
prior odd you know sometimes they allow

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,510
patents on things that already exist

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:04,020
so this this is a real this is again a

87
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,610
real patent patent drawing a patent and

88
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,290
name and you may think well you know

89
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,760
maybe the claims are a little different

90
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,679
you know in patent law or the claim at

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
the end of the patent is really the big

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,580
important thing this is you know like

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,350
it's a particular maybe it's on a

94
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,030
particular kind of brick made to build a

95
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,380
permit now it's really like you read the

96
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,599
claims and there's a bit of patentees

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,950
and a bit of a bit of you know sort of

98
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,530
pretend pretend complexity to it but

99
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,360
it's really a patent on bearing human

100
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,130
remains in a pyramid and you know if you

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,740
think the pen system is supposed to be

102
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,900
on something new you know I anyone in

103
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,380
this room aware of prior art on this

104
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,900
patent but you know like like what what

105
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,600
is the Patent Office doing like like

106
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:51,580
really like if you if you if used what

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:54,070
was the examiner like doing and and that

108
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:59,229
you know what like I just I just don't

109
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:01,360
know anyway so turning to to our beloved

110
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,710
software patents you know that we come

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,380
to the first question which is you know

112
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:12,760
what is a software patent it's it's not

113
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,120
really a clear definition of what a

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,490
software patent is it's it's certainly

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,060
not software like you sometimes you see

116
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:25,810
pseudocode in a software patent but you

117
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,150
very rarely see lines off of actual code

118
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,669
sometimes you'll see like a little a

119
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,729
little snippet here and there but but

120
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,370
generally it's like if you are if you're

121
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,900
at an organization and you have a

122
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,270
problem and you need to solve it with

123
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,890
software and you meet and you say well

124
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,719
what are we going to do about this the

125
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,330
software patent is the thing that

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,669
happens in the first 1 minute of that

127
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,950
meeting it's like well you know we've

128
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,690
obviously we're going to need this or

129
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:58,240
that structure or any server and like

130
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,219
you know all the hard work it's you know

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,150
it's just basically do a thing do a

132
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,150
thing with a computer

133
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:10,060
and we're so yeah if you look at

134
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,880
software patents they'll often be

135
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,060
flowcharts there'll be discussions of

136
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,000
using a processor and memory and like at

137
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,340
that level of generality and you know if

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,110
you if anyone who actually programs for

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,810
living like yeah you know I do in fact

140
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,020
use processes as part of this this is

141
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,180
not particularly inventive to tell me to

142
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,219
apply processing and memory to solve a

143
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,110
problem with software so what why do we

144
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,270
why do we care about software patents

145
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,420
like when the sort of my opposite

146
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,359
numbers the people who are UVM Utley in

147
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,070
favor of software patents so the the

148
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,360
kind of people from companies like IBM

149
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,980
or the intellectual property owners

150
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,690
organization when they talk about

151
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,940
patents they'll say well you know if

152
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,060
there are no patents anyone can just

153
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,270
steal your work and that's terrible and

154
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,860
there'll be no incentive to innovate and

155
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,960
you know that's not really true because

156
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,330
the the patent system is not about

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,460
copying copying is not an element of

158
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,219
patent infringement if you write a

159
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,280
program and you release it and then

160
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,510
someone sends you a letter saying I own

161
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,190
I have a patent on let me say with from

162
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,480
my favorite you know on on using a

163
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:33,200
computer to send notifications and your

164
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,730
app has notifications and you've never

165
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,409
heard of this person you've never read

166
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,940
this pattern there I'm completely

167
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,640
unknown in the community they had

168
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,469
nothing to do with any of the operating

169
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,690
system hardware anything to do with

170
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,030
anything to do with your app that does

171
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,810
not matter it doesn't matter at all the

172
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,919
question is do you infringe which is

173
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,240
patent there's the claims at the end

174
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:59,810
that has I claim XY and Z do you do XY

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,140
and Z and then is the patent valid and

176
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,210
then that's a question of was it new and

177
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,800
at the Patent Office that often means

178
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,570
really you know did someone else patent

179
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,580
it before because as we'll talk about in

180
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,190
more detail as we discuss some of these

181
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,680
patents the Patent Office is not great

182
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,419
at looking at prior

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,509
which is stuff that happened before you

184
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,039
applied prior are can be written it can

185
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,740
be publications but it can also be

186
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,560
things that are on sales so anything

187
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,000
that's in the App Store on github and

188
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,729
some kind of open source project or

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,099
whatever if it's available publicly its

190
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,199
prior art but very very little of that

191
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,510
prior rot is getting through filtering

192
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,979
in any meaningful way to the Patent

193
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,660
Office and so you get these patents

194
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,370
where they're they're really broad

195
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,719
they're from people who didn't

196
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,760
contribute in any meaningful way to

197
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,529
what's being done in the real world and

198
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,330
they're being asserted against people

199
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,910
who are our contributors are writing

200
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,430
original software and in the sense it's

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,040
very different from copyright copyright

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,689
there's their debates and questions

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,219
about how broad copyright should be on

204
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,600
software you make tour about Google the

205
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,950
Oracle and api's and reverse engineering

206
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,260
there's issues but at the end of the day

207
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,360
like if you copy a huge amount of code

208
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,100
you're probably and you're probably

209
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,500
infringing someone's copyright and it's

210
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,690
right there in the name of the legal

211
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,290
right copying and if you do it with

212
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,760
permission and that permission may be a

213
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,310
software license particularly in free

214
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,439
license world you get something it's a

215
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,029
free software project you fork it you

216
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,430
have you contribute to it whatever

217
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:37,310
you're operating within this zone of

218
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,979
permission and creativity and you can't

219
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,500
be then sued by the person who wrote the

220
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,060
eternal or whatever ten years ago

221
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,130
because they've licensed it to the world

222
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,779
under these under these terms

223
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,490
the problem with patents says someone

224
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,290
comes in from outside who has nothing to

225
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,959
do with anything with a piece of paper

226
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,439
and says alright now you owe me money

227
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,930
now now you can't do what you want to do

228
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,610
so let's get to some stupid patents

229
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,849
story too much about reading a little

230
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,820
text but we had one of our very first

231
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,010
stupid patents of the month was from

232
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,550
patent assertion entity called blue

233
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,990
spike that has a number of patents

234
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,109
basically they're they're on

235
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,000
fingerprinting and they've been very

236
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,040
active that's they've sued a number of

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,810
companies with mixed success the patent

238
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,870
there was the subject of this article

239
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,410
eventually got invalidated and that was

240
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,330
upheld on appeal

241
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,709
but this they still have other patents

242
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,530
in the family and other patents and

243
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,000
they're still actually suing companies

244
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,860
and they were they were very salty about

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,010
this article I got a lot of hate on

246
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,900
Twitter from friends of the inventor who

247
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,840
were extremely outraged that someone

248
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:50,340
would would critique this brilliant

249
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,230
genius who suggested like that using

250
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,960
reference generators feature selectors

251
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,280
comparing devices and recorders like you

252
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,480
could do it with software you know you

253
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,699
could do with hardware you could do it I

254
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,830
don't know with like water molecules but

255
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,890
you could you could do it with software

256
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,320
so so now he like owns this idea in his

257
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,610
mind for everything and this this kind

258
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,390
of highlights a recurring problem with

259
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,830
software patents in that the the system

260
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,080
software patents often involve claims

261
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,690
that are very very functional it's like

262
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,990
do a thing with a computer you know ever

263
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:27,840
comparing device or notifications or or

264
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,550
you know whatever and there's sort of

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,100
the this the Patent Office doesn't

266
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,949
really have a good sense of what's

267
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,540
amazingly easy and what's hard and so

268
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,510
they'll give patents that kind of have

269
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,020
both problems and that you get a patent

270
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:47,040
on something that's just mind-numbing ly

271
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:48,720
mundane like you know sending in a

272
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,599
second mobile will get to a out of

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,630
office email patent and then you get

274
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,950
patents on quite challenging things but

275
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,780
the patent doesn't actually tell you how

276
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,820
to do it it just says you know use them

277
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,770
on structures use some memory use you

278
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,500
know use a processor and do it with

279
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:07,260
software and good luck to you and you

280
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,460
know so people are claiming broadly are

281
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,920
they claiming really really obvious

282
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,600
ideas that claiming broadly are they

283
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,680
claiming basically the solution there

284
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,630
clay this is the problem with software

285
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,959
patents particularly as people get to

286
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,100
claim rather than rather they claim the

287
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,420
problem rather than the solution rather

288
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,670
than this is how I'm going to solve it

289
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,490
this particular way they're like solving

290
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:31,319
this problem X with a with with software

291
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,410
is my pattern and that so another one we

292
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,190
did we wrote up

293
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,439
this was early last year IBM patent I

294
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,680
found this just trolling the Gazette so

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,810
every Tuesday there about 300,000

296
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,899
patents issued every year so if you

297
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:53,810
check my things about 6,000 a week get

298
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:55,370
issued something like that and we find

299
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,930
stupid patents of the month in a variety

300
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,899
of ways we look to things that are being

301
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,888
asserted and trolling campaigns we look

302
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:06,110
for your people send them to us by email

303
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:08,810
but sometimes I just go and read The

304
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,459
Gazette comes out every Tuesday if you

305
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,050
know the classification system you can

306
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,779
kind of know where the garbage tends to

307
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,479
cluster and I'll just go and spend you

308
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,009
know a morning clicking through two or

309
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,730
three hundred patents to find some

310
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:24,139
really dumb and make fun of IBM and this

311
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,620
yeah so I just found the Gazette it's

312
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:30,980
the title is like you know out of office

313
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,810
email and the pen in fairness to IBM so

314
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,279
you know this was issued this was issued

315
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,630
last year I wrote about it right after

316
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,730
was issued in fairness to IBM it wasn't

317
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,160
just the idea of out of office email

318
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,199
there was a little tweak and the tweak

319
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,180
was that you could set up your out of

320
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,040
office email so that it would start

321
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,469
sending the message like a couple of

322
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,269
days before you went on vacation so it

323
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,740
would say I will be out of the office

324
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,709
next week you know this is a major

325
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,329
project you know wait till maybe it can

326
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:02,989
wait or whatever you want but like from

327
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:05,138
a technical perspective like this is not

328
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,120
this is not inventive this is just

329
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:11,180
clicking this is just adjusting settings

330
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,319
and software that if it doesn't already

331
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,269
exist is extremely mundane and extremely

332
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:20,269
easy to write I often give the example

333
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:21,769
that if you invented a car you wouldn't

334
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,990
give someone a patent for the idea of

335
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:26,990
driving the car before 8 a.m. on Sunday

336
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,269
because obviously you can drive a car at

337
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,100
a be like that that's just ridiculous

338
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,800
but you do see software patents that are

339
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,569
basically like that they're like you one

340
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
of us stupid patents of the month it's

341
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,760
not

342
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,420
in this presentation but it's it's on

343
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,850
updating computer game software to

344
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,370
update like if you have a game that's in

345
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,020
that's like the NFL or whatever and a

346
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,660
stadium changes may be a team move

347
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,670
Stadium you update the game so that the

348
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,620
graphics of the stadium isn't you and

349
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,420
it's just it's just a pen on updating

350
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,980
software like there's nothing in the

351
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,170
pattern that explained that solves any

352
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,120
new technical problems it's just like

353
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,920
people have been updating software and

354
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
over the Internet of course people have

355
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,120
been updating software over the internet

356
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,580
for a little while now but you know this

357
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,170
is a patent that was issued you know two

358
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,180
or three years ago and it was it was

359
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,650
asserted it was sue a he got sued and a

360
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,239
bunch of other companies got sued with

361
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:22,680
it and so one of the big problems here

362
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,560
is like you're thinking well out of

363
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,250
office email you know I heard it ring a

364
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:33,959
bell something that exists you know here

365
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,760
is a drawing from the patent and this is

366
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,380
you know the patent was filed I forget

367
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,760
the priority day but it's recent it's

368
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:45,500
like a 20 20 teens patent patent

369
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:50,040
application and you know this in 1998

370
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,720
screencap from notes I you think maybe

371
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,980
the examiner should be looking if we

372
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,350
assume the software patents are a thing

373
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,970
that should exist that the the examiner

374
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,930
should at least look at some software

375
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,880
but this patent was examined and on a

376
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,400
patent they'll show there's a list of

377
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,980
references considered by the examiner

378
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,020
they're all patents like the the you're

379
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,030
talking about out of office email and

380
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,100
the Patent Office isn't looking at any

381
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,770
software at all it's only other patents

382
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,180
so so this is particularly punishing for

383
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,699
the free software world where people

384
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,410
have philosophical objections to patent

385
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,660
so they're not filing them it's like a

386
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,270
40,000 you know filing a patent paying

387
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:32,550
the lawyer all of that it's like a forty

388
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,930
thousand dollar project to to get it in

389
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,849
and that's a really expensive way to

390
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,359
create private it doesn't actually it's

391
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,770
not prymaat if you publish it online you

392
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,520
put it on github or whatever that's

393
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,069
prior art

394
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,270
but the Patent Office will only look at

395
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,790
it if it's a pattern and you know I'm

396
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,530
gonna spend 40 grand to file a patent in

397
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,719
the hope that one day some examiner is

398
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,060
gonna look at it

399
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,310
fortunately IBM was sufficiently shamed

400
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,099
by the media coverage of this patent

401
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:03,849
that they actually disclaimed it which

402
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,110
is I was quite surprised by I would have

403
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,459
thought they would just ignore us I mean

404
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:10,510
that's what I would do if I was their PR

405
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:12,339
person but which means they file a Form

406
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,609
with the Patent Office that says this is

407
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,740
now dedicated to the public so I can I

408
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,300
can give you all the good news that if

409
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,339
you want to write an out-of-office email

410
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,290
client that sends the out of office

411
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:28,030
email a day or two early you can now do

412
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,070
that without infringing a patent so

413
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,930
that's how IBM reacted IBM you know kind

414
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,909
of figured well well we'll head this off

415
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,590
at the pass we'll will accept a little

416
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,400
bad press and give the patent to the

417
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:43,090
public that has unfortunately not been

418
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,190
our experience with all of these all of

419
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,090
these place it's a lot of that a lot of

420
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,790
the patterns we write about are by what

421
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,010
are informally called patent trolls

422
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:56,500
companies that that assert patents sort

423
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,510
of as their business model there's you

424
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,460
know no clear definition of control but

425
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,280
you know in our view if asserting a

426
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,010
patent is your main game then we think

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,680
that's pretty trollee but the problem

428
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:13,210
with patent trolls is you know if your

429
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,790
main game is litigating then you know if

430
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,580
you you start to see every problem as a

431
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,190
litigation problem and so getting

432
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,659
criticism maybe is also a litigation

433
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,550
problem so 2015 we wrote about a company

434
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,890
called then called Eclipse IP they

435
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,090
changed their name I suspect to get out

436
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,090
from the Google results

437
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:42,480
they're now called what is it electronic

438
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,490
technologies LLC something anyway

439
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,330
something extremely Monday something

440
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,250
very hard to Google and this was a

441
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,139
patent on a kind of notification there

442
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,660
are a lot of patents on just note of

443
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,390
little tweaks to notifications little

444
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,030
tweaks to geolocation like pretty much

445
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,490
any kind of thing you do with an app

446
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,550
there's just this huge cluster of

447
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,110
patents on any kind of small

448
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,290
modification to the feature you can

449
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,740
think of the inventor in this case is a

450
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,470
patent lawyer and that's not uncommon

451
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,660
with a lot of trolli patents there was a

452
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,970
guy that sued Twitter for asserting a

453
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,560
patent on having a social network but

454
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,750
with famous people and he he later in

455
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,639
full disclosure my firm represented

456
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,890
Twitter in that case he later in

457
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,880
deposition admitted he had never an

458
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,650
Alana code

459
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,280
he thought of the patent in half an hour

460
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,410
and you know sort of half an hour's work

461
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,820
social network of famous people they're

462
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,800
famous people on Twitter twittering

463
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,740
fringes that all that went all the way

464
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,560
to a jury that the judge didn't grant

465
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,630
summary judgment so you know without

466
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,790
without being specific going to a jury

467
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,140
is expensive it's very very common in

468
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,960
patent litigation that will cost more

469
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,430
than a million dollars so you know

470
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,570
someone spends half an hour patent

471
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,760
lawyers spends half an hour thinking

472
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,310
about something that costs you a million

473
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,140
bucks not super fair and how of you

474
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,139
anyway turning back to this patent

475
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,110
lawyer we wrote about this this case

476
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,090
eclipsed IP had filed a number of

477
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,520
lawsuits with this patent see in the

478
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,230
same family this was a new pattern that

479
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,830
issued from the family that had been

480
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,980
asserted very widely and we were we were

481
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:29,129
annoyed because other patents in the

482
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,410
family had been found invalid and this

483
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,360
was under the I'm gonna talk in more

484
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,980
detail about Alice PC LS bank this does

485
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,159
this decision from the Supreme Court

486
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,690
that says you can't have an abstract

487
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,660
software patent where it's an abstract

488
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,460
idea on a generic computer came came

489
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,320
down in 2014

490
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,749
has been really good for a lot of these

491
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,820
really really low value software patents

492
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,889
been thrown out and we were concerned

493
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,999
that they had issued more the pen office

494
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,258
had issued more patents in the same

495
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:58,230
family even though others were being

496
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,789
thrown out the prosecutor they hadn't

497
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,440
disclosed this to the Patent Office at

498
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:06,059
the time we called them out but didn't

499
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:12,299
you know it started to get interesting

500
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:13,860
after that so so the inventor the

501
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:19,980
lawyers got hasta Meyer sued me

502
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:23,459
personally sued EF f and I was pretty

503
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:28,169
mad his lawyer his lawyers name was

504
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,669
Sanford Esmond goes by Sandy and he had

505
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,220
already been in the news for a trademark

506
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,779
threat against a start-up and I was

507
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,169
Technica people had being kind of

508
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:40,289
getting stuck into him on the on the on

509
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:42,230
the comments and I will fully admit that

510
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:45,690
these comments were pretty immature

511
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:53,190
sandy Esmond people had people had been

512
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:54,960
modifying that very slightly but we we

513
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,789
fortunately found a law firm that

514
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,769
represented us for free and we send them

515
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:00,779
a very detailed letter explaining that

516
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:02,369
this speech was protected by the First

517
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,789
Amendment

518
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,649
one of the disputes was they were very

519
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,759
upset that we had complained that the

520
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,709
patent office hadn't been told about

521
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,110
this court decision and they were like

522
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,149
there is no ethical duty to tell the

523
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,189
Penn office about a court decision this

524
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:19,768
ethical duty to disclose power out that

525
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,960
you know only rule only applies to

526
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:24,570
actual pro art like journal articles and

527
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,830
so on but you know the actual manual for

528
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,869
patent examination and procedure and

529
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,820
Federal Circuit law is extremely clear

530
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:31,379
like there are decisions directly on

531
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,519
point that is not the case you do have

532
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:38,299
to disclose do have to disclose legal

533
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,409
decisions that are that are material and

534
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,450
which you know was pretty ironic because

535
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,740
part of their criticism was that I'm not

536
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,379
a patent prosecutor I'm not a member of

537
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,419
the patent bar and so they were like you

538
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,918
don't know anything about anything we

539
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,870
know all about patent prosecution and

540
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,549
their lead complaint was 100% wrong

541
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,840
anyway so we write back we said we were

542
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:02,870
100 we were really not not gonna give in

543
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:15,709
I got some I got some pretty negative

544
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:17,918
press and then and they abandoned the

545
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,720
case three days after they served it

546
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,030
which was a wise decision it was it was

547
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,669
a really really foolish lawsuit in my

548
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,610
view they are entitled to disagree with

549
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:32,210
our opinions but they cannot use the

550
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:34,490
courts to censor us so on that topic

551
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,190
courts trying to censor I will turn to

552
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,190
another stupid pad of the month this is

553
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:45,070
a patent owned by an Australian company

554
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:48,530
called global equity management si and

555
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,040
it's basically speaking very very

556
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,418
broadly and loosely it sits on a GUI of

557
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,309
managing different operating systems

558
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:57,890
managing storage and different operating

559
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,590
systems virtual having virtual

560
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,270
virtualization and you so you have

561
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,159
virtual cabinets you have a thing to

562
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,549
click on why they bla I didn't think it

563
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,290
was a very good patent the inventor

564
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:12,530
disagrees he is entitled to that view

565
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,899
but you know I think I'm well within my

566
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,790
rights to criticize the patent but we

567
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,559
got we got a kind of a nasty Graham

568
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,570
about it and so this is from an

569
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,790
Australian lawyer so I'll read it in my

570
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:28,790
best Australian accent I demand of

571
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:32,178
apology for slander and differ Tory

572
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,918
statements does that does anyone know

573
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,049
what F Atari means I'm not sure if

574
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,100
that's a that's a legal term of art that

575
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm not not familiar with we have been

576
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,049
consulted by global equity management is

577
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,720
a proprietary limited here and after

578
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:49,940
repeated - is our client to write you in

579
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,010
relation to the defamatory false and

580
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,960
malicious slander which you and the

581
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,260
Electronic Frontier Foundation made

582
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,990
concerning a client on Eire v org at a

583
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,799
website that's naughty FF - org in the

584
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,510
attached article

585
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:07,059
the sad statement was made available to

586
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,919
the viewing of the worldwide public with

587
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:10,809
the intention of portraying our clients

588
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:16,960
intellectual property a stupid

589
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:19,090
I mean guilty in addition to numerous

590
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,210
other malicious laws and misleading

591
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:26,799
statements to be at the 400 p ry ear

592
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,899
coin yes you know and actually filed a

593
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,658
suit lawsuit in the Supreme Court of

594
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:33,158
South Australia and they got an

595
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,779
injunction temperate they got a

596
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,990
preliminary injunction which they served

597
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:39,940
on iff asking us to take down take down

598
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:43,600
the article and to never talk about

599
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,960
their intellectual property again which

600
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,090
you know that's really not how it works

601
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,210
in the United States and fortunately

602
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,918
there is a law called the speech act and

603
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,029
I forget some god-awful backronym as

604
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:03,010
these things usually are that allows you

605
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:05,649
to go to court to sue to have a foreign

606
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,260
order declared unenforceable if it's

607
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,820
contrary to the First Amendment and it's

608
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,559
it's basically a law against libel

609
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,350
tourism so you can't just go to

610
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,549
Australia or the United Kingdom get a

611
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,990
judgment against a United States

612
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:22,779
organisation like EF F and and enforce

613
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:25,299
it in US courts and so we we sued them

614
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:28,029
in the Northern District of California a

615
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,950
federal court here they never appeared

616
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:32,350
even though they actually were filing

617
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,899
they were litigating patent cases in the

618
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:39,459
same district literally in the courtroom

619
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:45,219
down the hall and we we won we got a

620
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:46,929
great judgement explaining why our our

621
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,630
article was protected by the First

622
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:52,830
Amendment and why an injunction asking

623
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,830
us to take it down and

624
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,370
not speaking about there I mean that for

625
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:58,990
a First Amendment lawyer and injunction

626
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,219
telling you not to speak about an entire

627
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:08,320
topic ever again it's just it's just so

628
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:12,700
far outside what is contemplated in US

629
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,070
law and then just sort of as a coda to

630
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:20,140
all this that patent got thrown out so I

631
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:21,820
said the the patent trial and appeal

632
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,539
board which is a body within the Patent

633
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,918
Office ended up ended up finding this

634
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:33,940
patent invalid

635
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:39,330
I think the prior art was it was oh I

636
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:42,520
forget anyway there was partitionmagic

637
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:46,030
partitionmagic was the was the prior

638
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,129
right anyway so that was that you know

639
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,559
this is these are these are kind of a

640
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,090
distraction we don't want to have to

641
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,418
deal with these lawsuits we just want to

642
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:59,110
be able to express how huge but

643
00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:01,450
fortunately the First Amendment has come

644
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,719
through for us first I think the the

645
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,220
first case was dismissed because

646
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,380
speculating obviously but that the the

647
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,720
lawyers will sense that it was you know

648
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,270
however much he might disagree with us

649
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,309
that was not going to be a successful

650
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:22,360
suit and it was not going to be any fun

651
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:24,220
either at least for him and that the and

652
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,539
then with the Australian suit then the

653
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:29,380
the speech act in the First Amendment

654
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:32,620
really came through for us so anyway

655
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,270
turning from stupid part of the month I

656
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,949
want to get to sort of some big picture

657
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:40,480
patent policy stuff and it's gonna go

658
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:43,419
just quickly go through mostly talking

659
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,169
about Alice this decision from 2014

660
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:51,100
about software patents but before that

661
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:52,330
give you a this super quick idea about

662
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,879
some of the things that have happened in

663
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,918
the last 10 or so years and it's

664
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,500
generally been pretty good I mean the

665
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,530
pent system is still very very flawed in

666
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,470
our view and it is still interferes with

667
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,660
free software in ways that it should

668
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:11,040
but there have been a lot of good things

669
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,170
eBay is a decision from 2006 that is is

670
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,600
really quite a major decision in that it

671
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,040
makes it it used to be routine that if

672
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,929
you want a patent case you got an

673
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,280
injunction stopping the other person

674
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:25,530
from doing what they selling or

675
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,680
distributing or whatever and sort of in

676
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,600
the around this time research in motion

677
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,790
got sued on a software patent or

678
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,500
relating to the BlackBerry and they were

679
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,030
looking at an injunction preventing the

680
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,860
sales of blackberries and they ended up

681
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:43,590
paying six hundred and fifty million

682
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:45,780
dollars to to that patent owner and that

683
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,090
pressure the injection is really kind of

684
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,670
what drove that I think and so it's it's

685
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:55,110
it's quite a while ago now but I without

686
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:57,450
it the world would be even crazier case

687
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,860
IV telefax made it obvious snows made a

688
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,330
little bit easier to show you something

689
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,070
as obvious based on prayer at the

690
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,389
Federal Circuit which is the court below

691
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,010
the Supreme Court that his patent cases

692
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,570
is kind of even though they're not

693
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,270
supposed to is kind of undone it in a

694
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,840
lot of ways the America Invents Act was

695
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:16,670
a law in 2011 created new processes at

696
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,820
the Patent Office to challenge patents

697
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,830
has been much more successful in my view

698
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,450
than expected much more bad for the

699
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,040
people on the other side than they

700
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,870
expected I think and so that's how we

701
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,510
challenged this patent on podcasting I

702
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:36,209
mentioned the Startalk and similarly

703
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:39,870
that's how the the patent on virtual

704
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,540
cabinets got invalidated octane makes it

705
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,909
easier to get fees that has been used in

706
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,000
in some pretty abusive troll cases and I

707
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:50,100
think is a deterrent if Alice P CLS Bank

708
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,560
get to that at a moment so big big one

709
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:56,540
and then T C Heartland is a case about

710
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,280
venue it's very in the weeds on law but

711
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,520
it's about the interpreting the statute

712
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,520
that tells you which kind of which which

713
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,410
federal quote you can file in previously

714
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,940
things many of you might have even heard

715
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,510
of this because I got it got so out of

716
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,110
whack

717
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,610
it was even on like John Oliver that the

718
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,040
Eastern District of Texas particularly

719
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,469
the courthouse in Marshall was totally

720
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,810
dominating patent litigation at one

721
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,000
point more than a thousand cases were

722
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,250
before one judge in Marshall that was

723
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,520
about 25 percent of all patent

724
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,650
litigation in the country which is

725
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,500
completely nuts and in our view is

726
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,020
really fueled by that court having a lot

727
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,880
of local rules that tilted the playing

728
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,580
field and that's how they attracted this

729
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,530
business it was a pretty small town it

730
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,280
was very lucrative for a lot of a lot of

731
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:49,940
like restaurants printers whatnot and

732
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,040
you know that I I've heard Eastern

733
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,050
District Texas lawyers openly talk about

734
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,620
the judges that started to bring this

735
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,899
there as rain makers you know it is

736
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:04,040
really not the job of a federal judge to

737
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,200
be a Rainmaker for a town but it was

738
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,550
pretty shameless and it's still it's

739
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,870
still a problem of international

740
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,210
companies can still be sued in any

741
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,340
district so if if your Samsung you're

742
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,190
here still gonna enjoy the barbecue down

743
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,919
and Marshall but it's going from about

744
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,950
20 fights it's going from at its peak I

745
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,390
think you got to about 35 or 45 I mean

746
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,860
it was a lot it was like at least a

747
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,420
third of patent suits were being filed

748
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,490
in a detects and now it's back down to

749
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:33,140
about ten percent just still crazy but

750
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:37,730
it's not as crazy so Alice our friend

751
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:44,030
Alice has a great graphic by Hugh Dondre

752
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:46,100
who works at e FF he Alice is a decision

753
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:52,580
it came out of a case that was basically

754
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:55,790
on a patent on what's the word a sort of

755
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,250
settlement off if you have two parties

756
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,600
you want to get one money to the one to

757
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,060
the other but there's you know trust

758
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,159
issues use Bitcoin of course not you use

759
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,690
a trusted third party and it was

760
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,830
basically a patent on on the idea of you

761
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:14,460
trusted third party and but with a

762
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:17,970
computer of course and went up to the

763
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,509
Supreme Court Supreme Court said section

764
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:24,299
101 of the patent Act which is basically

765
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:26,279
what's patentable you can't patent an

766
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,830
idea you can't patent something that

767
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,979
already exists in nature it has to be a

768
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:34,590
new and useful machine-or-transformation

769
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:36,720
you and you and you and you and they

770
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,840
said under the statute you can't patent

771
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,940
a abstract idea that is implemented on a

772
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,488
generic computer you can't just say do a

773
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,279
thing do it here's a good idea do it on

774
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,690
a computer it is not the death of all

775
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,869
software patents particularly the

776
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,190
Federal Circuit as there's a few cases

777
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,570
from the Federal Circuit really pushing

778
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,759
back against the idea that it's the

779
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,649
death of all software patents but it is

780
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,149
it has been the death of a certain kind

781
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:02,728
of software patent and a lot of them

782
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:04,709
were the really the worst the kind of

783
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:09,030
patents that were being asserted against

784
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:12,619
500 companies at once that we're on you

785
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:17,789
know voting online or or you know

786
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:19,919
tracking a vehicle really really broad

787
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,919
broad patents a lot of them got thrown

788
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:26,399
out so it's been a really excellent

789
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,469
decision it's been a lot of backlash

790
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,779
against it judge more as a judge on the

791
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:33,928
Federal Circuit around the time of that

792
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:35,699
before it got to the Supreme Court where

793
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,950
you know basically writing for the

794
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,989
Supreme Court in her dissent she said

795
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,819
that a decision in validating the claims

796
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:44,098
would decimate the electronic and

797
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:46,529
software industries and I'm sorry to say

798
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,970
she was correct no software has been

799
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:49,969
written since June 2014

800
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:58,100
Manny Schechter chief patent counsel IBM

801
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,750
patents promote innovation Alice

802
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,819
decision as progeny or juicing

803
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,760
innovation you see it might be a missing

804
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,860
step somewhere in there legislation is

805
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,810
needed so that America continues to be a

806
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,970
worldwide innovation leader and this is

807
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,730
the the folks we fight with in the

808
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,080
public policy well they have this

809
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,600
completely unexamined assumption that

810
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,540
patents always promote innovation this

811
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,069
if you weaken patents and Alice in some

812
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,900
ways weakens patents it makes it harder

813
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,660
to get patents that this is going to

814
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,760
hurt innovation R&D and software is is

815
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,759
going up it went up much more in 2015

816
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,190
that it did in 2014 it's completely

817
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,350
divorced from reality as a view but it

818
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,450
is a view that is extremely strongly

819
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,540
held it is a religion from the patent

820
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:44,600
people so the intellectual property

821
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:49,250
owners association is proposing

822
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,980
legislation this is the language 101 B

823
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:56,120
now the only exception of the subject

824
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:59,300
matter eligibility if it basically

825
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:02,540
already existed in nature or exists

826
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,770
solely in the human mind and so to give

827
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,770
you an idea of what that would mean

828
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:09,290
right now we have a client who is being

829
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:13,730
threatened by hodder & stoughton a UK

830
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:16,580
publisher he releases language lessons

831
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:20,710
online and hodder and stoughton claimed

832
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:23,690
to be the licensee of a patent that is

833
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,610
having language lessons on a recorded

834
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,400
medium in a certain order it's it's a

835
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,910
really really banal order it's basically

836
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,980
having call question-and-answer on a

837
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:36,350
recorded medium but that would satisfy

838
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,910
this it's recorded meets a tape a tape

839
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:42,020
is a physical thing it doesn't exist

840
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:44,270
solely in the human mind so that would

841
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,590
make that at least under 101 it without

842
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,960
be eligible you would still have to

843
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,000
satisfy obvious Ness or whatnot but

844
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,130
we've seen kind of what a great job the

845
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,390
Patent Office does of that and if the if

846
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,450
the Penn office finds itself having

847
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:58,549
getting patents on language lessons on

848
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,660
tape where the language is structured in

849
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,520
a certain way

850
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,319
like it has to go and find language

851
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,530
lessons structured in that way to deny

852
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:11,060
the patent if this becomes the wall

853
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:13,880
which is really really nuts so we we

854
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,700
have this say by alice project where

855
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,230
it's upper ffs org Alice where we tell a

856
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,149
bunch of stories about companies that

857
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,680
have managed to use the Alice decision

858
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,970
to defend themselves against threats

859
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,490
from really really stupid patents and

860
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:35,089
we're sort of preparing to fight back

861
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:37,160
because there are IBM the intellectual

862
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,720
property owners organization that AI PLA

863
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,390
which is the intellectual property

864
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,720
lawyers and a bunch of other

865
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,490
organizations are really trying to

866
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,839
pressure Congress nothing has been

867
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:52,520
formally introduced and that's going

868
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,720
anywhere yet there's a there's a bill in

869
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,800
the house that's been introduced by

870
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,359
someone that's not even on the right

871
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,980
committee so it's not really going

872
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:02,480
anywhere but the senator Coons in the

873
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,150
Senate is on the intellectual property

874
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,750
on judiciary and which has intellectual

875
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,060
property jurisdiction and he I think

876
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,290
would would be likely to you know

877
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,390
willing to it to introduce something

878
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,570
like this so we're you know we're gonna

879
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,980
be looking for people who actually write

880
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,530
software or know about software and care

881
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,680
about software to be to be ready to kind

882
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:27,680
of counter messages on this and you may

883
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,980
see early next year us doing call outs

884
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,609
for people to call Congress or do visits

885
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:37,880
I went to Congress to the hill in June

886
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,380
and did some visits with staffers to

887
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,080
sort of tell them that you know the sky

888
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,300
has not fallen since the house decision

889
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,650
IBM gets nine thousand pet got nine

890
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,990
thousand patents last year it doesn't

891
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,420
need to get twenty thousand this is this

892
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,209
is everything is going to be fine

893
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,900
but it's mostly you know from apps this

894
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:00,140
is defense there is not there's not a

895
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:03,200
move to abolish all software patents

896
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,839
in Congress that's not a lot of momentum

897
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,720
for that I think you know that's a

898
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,450
long-term battle that this stupid pad in

899
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,848
the month series is a network is pot off

900
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:19,520
but for the moment really trying to

901
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:24,430
defend Alice and with that I think we

902
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:33,170
can go to questions I think there's a I

903
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:36,440
think there's a microphone here for the

904
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:38,869
open source community sorry for the open

905
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,910
source community yes is there

906
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,279
what sort of protections does one have

907
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:46,308
when one unintentionally infringes on

908
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:48,289
one of these esoteric gotcha type

909
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:51,160
patents if you're not selling the

910
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:55,700
product what can they do to you so

911
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,200
unfortunately if you're there's really I

912
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,490
can't give you a particularly satisfying

913
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,950
answer there is a difference if you've

914
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,629
never heard of the patent there is you

915
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,819
are at higher risk for willful

916
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,789
infringement where there's theoretically

917
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,558
treble damages are available at the

918
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:11,210
judges discretion in cases of willful

919
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,829
infringement thing about willful

920
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,809
infringement as though is that you don't

921
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,900
get there unless you've gone through the

922
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:20,660
whole litigation and lost and you know

923
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,220
so by that point you know you've already

924
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:28,910
you're already out so much money on the

925
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:33,049
litigation it's but from you know you

926
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:34,578
can try and document your code well so

927
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:36,380
that it's easy for people to find so

928
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:41,230
they can take they can defend themselves

929
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:43,490
by showing it as as prior art you can

930
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,020
but unfortunately the the problem is

931
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,839
because they come so much from outside

932
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,910
the community there's this if the

933
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,578
pattern were found valid and you know

934
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:56,180
you you infringe you could you know use

935
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:57,680
your that that's that's that's enough I

936
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,450
mean hopefully with Alice that will give

937
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,799
you a good defense against a lot of the

938
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,109
kind of patents that the open source

939
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:05,000
community would be worried about but a

940
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:07,369
lot of that sort of still in flux the

941
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,150
Federal Circuit's still still grappling

942
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:12,519
with what Alice means and

943
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,470
so it doesn't it doesn't provide like

944
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:17,758
sort of a complete software patents of

945
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,759
dead comfort

946
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:34,969
so I say you have yeah weed you can't be

947
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:37,758
the man you really shouldn't have to

948
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:39,969
worry too much about the intent there's

949
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:43,160
really not much willfulness that you can

950
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:48,019
you know infuse into an open-source

951
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,129
discovery and so I think you are

952
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,140
relatively safe

953
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,789
well yeah on willfulness but but on

954
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,979
infringement it doesn't matter if you're

955
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,109
if the intent is irrelevant in terms of

956
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:59,299
punitive damages it is very important

957
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:01,759
yeah I think there are a lot of open

958
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:04,038
source projects the cost of patent

959
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:06,890
litigation itself would be just would be

960
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:09,170
we'd demolish them yeah I'm just you

961
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:14,239
know that's my opinion I thank you in

962
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,670
good shape hi so I was wondering if you

963
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,650
could elaborate a little bit on the

964
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:20,660
Australian lawsuit that you mentioned I

965
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,519
guess I have a few questions that are

966
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,109
sort of around that theme like one of

967
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:25,669
them is you know did the if I've

968
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:27,650
actually try to challenge the Australian

969
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,989
court case and and where did that go and

970
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,089
also I like are you personally banned

971
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:34,489
from Australia did you get arrested if

972
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,170
you were served if you showed up in

973
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:38,109
Australia yeah I mean I wish Australia

974
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,109
sucks

975
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:41,109
Wow

976
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:47,749
yeah we didn't FFF didn't appear and I

977
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:49,579
honestly don't know what happened they

978
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:54,499
served us with a preliminary injunction

979
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:56,179
and that I gave up or we don't know they

980
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:58,519
never they never served us with anything

981
00:42:56,179 --> 00:43:01,549
else they never properly served us with

982
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:07,459
the moving papers either so it was a

983
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:09,799
pretty pretty hot last effort okay hey

984
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:12,549
so first off thank you for all of the

985
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:17,029
hard work you do protecting developers I

986
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:19,279
am a developer slash product owner and I

987
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:22,910
am responsible for you know a team of

988
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:25,069
six other people very small but you know

989
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,879
I love my project and I wanted to last

990
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:30,710
so when my client comes to me and says

991
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,780
my investors

992
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:36,260
to give me a million dollars if I have

993
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:38,450
ten software patents yeah what do I do

994
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,310
yeah you look you know I'm not so

995
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,290
judgmental on these kind of things I

996
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,060
think you know I personally think

997
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,800
software patents a bad for the world and

998
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,080
that it's better if we don't get them

999
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,360
but I understand that people operate in

1000
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,799
the world that exists you know you may

1001
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,270
not want to pay taxes to fund Wars but

1002
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,650
you know that's that's the law and

1003
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,620
you're the alternative is going to jail

1004
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:04,700
it's not the patents you do you do you

1005
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:06,859
know I think you can you most soft pure

1006
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,600
software companies that are that are

1007
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,800
either software-as-a-service or selling

1008
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,470
suffered our fairly patent light it tint

1009
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,290
moist software patents come like the

1010
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,180
real volume comes from the Giants so you

1011
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,529
know I've been making fun of IBM but you

1012
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,339
know there are other Google gets like

1013
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:28,970
3,000 pounds a year Microsoft gets four

1014
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:31,430
or five thousand a year there there are

1015
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:34,100
some venture people that that care about

1016
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,169
patents and prefer prefer patents there

1017
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:41,990
it's certainly not all and on software

1018
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:43,550
patents it's a it's a quiet mixed mixed

1019
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:45,290
view that there's been some empirical

1020
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,550
research on this asking venture

1021
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,210
capitalist what they think of software

1022
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:52,700
patents and and the those that do care

1023
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,260
even those that care often it's not that

1024
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,410
I really think the software patent is

1025
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,910
gonna do you as a company any good it's

1026
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,580
just gonna be there'll be something left

1027
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,149
in the jar if if it all goes belly-up

1028
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:07,310
and and that's you know that's as a

1029
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:14,750
founder that's really not very little

1030
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:16,970
comfort but yeah and I you know I think

1031
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,960
with sometimes I get similar questions

1032
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,370
from people who are at the bigger

1033
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,800
companies where they're pressure to

1034
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,390
apply and help the help the health of

1035
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,410
patent lawyers apply and say like you

1036
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:29,319
know like you you got to do your job but

1037
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:31,730
you know if they do start to write

1038
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,620
ridiculously broad claims or they're

1039
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:37,100
trying to penned stuff that you know is

1040
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:38,299
and five years ago like push back you

1041
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,770
know don't don't let them get away with

1042
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:46,220
it thank you

1043
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:48,680
sure oh good evening do you have a

1044
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,649
position on what might be characterized

1045
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,940
as standards essential patents you know

1046
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,910
like I write a lot of software like in

1047
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:58,070
the actual TV space and you know the FCC

1048
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:00,049
has laws that say you must conform with

1049
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:01,550
these standards yeah but these standards

1050
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,620
have patents that come along with them

1051
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,660
in order to implement them yeah we

1052
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,640
haven't done a ton of work on on

1053
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,529
standard essential patents in the last

1054
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,069
few years I'm just you know so many

1055
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:16,250
other other issues bubbling but we

1056
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:19,010
definitely are on the lookout for cases

1057
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,510
where there's abuse where where people

1058
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,040
get so you might have heard a brand of

1059
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,570
reasonable non-discriminatory royalties

1060
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,540
and some companies take very different

1061
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:28,880
views of their obligations when they

1062
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:33,200
have when they're when they have reined

1063
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,730
obligations and first standards so and

1064
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,259
it is unfortunately part of why some

1065
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:40,300
companies want to get patents so they

1066
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:43,010
have a little bit of a little bit more

1067
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:50,780
leverage in when standards are being

1068
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:52,340
developed but yeah we're you know it is

1069
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,680
it is particularly frustrating when good

1070
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,450
standards aren't created because of

1071
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:00,169
patent risk and patent pen where ease

1072
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,879
from from bad actors but you know and

1073
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:04,370
it's particularly terrible when people

1074
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,840
do follow standards because you know

1075
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,120
it's a standard you have 80 to 11 or

1076
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,670
whatever and then someone jumps out from

1077
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,529
under a rock and says I have a patent

1078
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:16,400
that covers this standard and everyone

1079
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:20,690
everyone and their dog can get sued so

1080
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,890
yeah we but but it's it's good to sort

1081
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,240
of have it brought up because there's

1082
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:26,290
actually an area that we want to think

1083
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,290
about more into my work in

1084
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,830
yeah we get we got about three minutes

1085
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,440
so we definitely have time for a

1086
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:43,650
question if anyone anyone else oh yeah

1087
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:47,490
someone coming up our local paper of the

1088
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,350
Village Voice had a whole issue more

1089
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:52,379
than 10 years ago devoted to how

1090
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:55,940
demoralized the whole Patent Office was

1091
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:59,390
that the patent examiner's were

1092
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:06,090
discouraged poorly paid understaffed and

1093
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:07,799
it was basically a tragic mess is that

1094
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:10,320
your sense of what's going on there now

1095
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,910
yeah I mean we try not to make too much

1096
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,200
like fun of the examiner's and if you

1097
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:19,410
they don't have enough time the the

1098
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,910
average per patent application from from

1099
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,670
when it was first filed to an claims

1100
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:27,029
issue is 22 hours of examined our time

1101
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:29,220
and only you know maybe half of that is

1102
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,150
on looking for prior odds so you can

1103
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,350
understand why they're looking at

1104
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,420
patents that it's much more accessible

1105
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,790
to them they're not gonna you know

1106
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:40,380
getting onto github and studying looking

1107
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:42,390
looking at at software projects there is

1108
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,580
gonna be way more work and take way

1109
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,819
longer and they don't have that time so

1110
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:51,360
the system is just not set up to really

1111
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,860
do a good job and unfortunately you see

1112
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,650
that you see that particularly in areas

1113
00:48:52,860 --> 00:49:01,470
that a patent why there's so much non

1114
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:03,000
patent art like sulfur and but and it

1115
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:06,180
varies there's actually some really kind

1116
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,820
of disturbing research that patent

1117
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,250
examiner's that progress and stay there

1118
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,750
longer and get promoted they get less

1119
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,070
and less time to do it which you know

1120
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,360
usually it would make sense like you're

1121
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,560
you're you're getting better at your job

1122
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,840
you're supposed to do things quicker but

1123
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,210
they're already given so little and it's

1124
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,330
very clear that the examiners they get

1125
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:28,440
to stay become rubber stamps and they

1126
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:30,049
have more obvious honest findings of

1127
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,869
litigated patents

1128
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,550
if the examiner was more senior it's

1129
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,500
more likely the pattern would be found

1130
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,850
invalid in court if it's challenged

1131
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,950
which is exactly the opposite of what

1132
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:41,509
you would you would want to see if it

1133
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,779
was kind of a function if it was you

1134
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:46,280
know if the system was set up well and

1135
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,950
and with that I will I will end it

1136
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,719
thanks for coming out

1137
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:51,718
[Applause]
