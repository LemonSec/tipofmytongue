controversial fascinating material and

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:38,390
here in the hacker world we don't do

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,670
drama well okay what let me rephrase um

14

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,798
want to thank Bernie s for making this

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,770
possible he did an amazing job

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,880
just organizing all of this and many of

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,880
the other talks here at the conference

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:43,380
and without much further ado I'd like to

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,229
go into this conversation with chelsea

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,890
manning i am so in awe that chelsea is

37
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,920
here with us and you know a few years

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,830
ago we showed the video collateral

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,159
murder and i said at the time that

40
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,798
whoever released this as a true hero and

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,430
i mean that just as much today sometimes

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,590
the truth is something that hurts us

43
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,539
something we don't want to confront but

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,400
we have to and that's something all of

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,690
us in the hacker community I think we

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,980
get because we're always asking

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,569
questions and people always telling us

48
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,369
to shut up and just accept the answer

49
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,839
alright but we just keep persisting

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,880
until we find out the truth and

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,769
sometimes we don't like the answer and I

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,109
know there are a lot of people who

53
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,519
aren't cool with where we're going with

54
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,590
certain things or the answers that we're

55
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,100
putting out and the dialogue is welcome

56
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,420
and the argument is welcome but the

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,260
other thing that's welcome is respect

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,958
and just an atmosphere where people

59
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,450
don't feel fear for being themselves and

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,549
I think that's something that I really

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,768
have to admire Chelsea for because not

62
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:50,790
only did she come forward and tell the

63
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,880
truth a great personal risk and cost but

64
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,350
she has also led for so many people who

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,880
are feeling oppression or feeling like

66
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,820
they cannot be themselves she's

67
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,310
assigning an example of of how to do

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,079
that right and I'm just so in awe of

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,850
what she has accomplished and what she

70
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,320
will continue to accomplish and without

71
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,630
any further ado I'd like to introduce

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Chelsea Manning and yong-joo brilliant

73
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,230
technologist who will be interviewing

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,578
her we'll be taking questions a little

75
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,578
bit later on enjoy

76
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,510
thank great man you all right here we

77
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:39,480
are yeah so I so I was here in 2010 when

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,189
we saw the Collateral Murder video and

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,310
everyone was talking about it and it was

80
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:46,290
such a big deal and everyone was talking

81
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,420
about you and now finally eight years

82
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,040
later you're you're here so how does

83
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,429
that feel what's it what's it like to be

84
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,409
at hope I mean it's great I I was

85
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,879
actually wanting to come to hope that

86
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:06,720
year but I got a little busy yeah I

87
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:08,280
guess so yeah it's it's quite incredible

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,139
I mean a certainly an emotional

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,269
experience and I you know I I enjoy the

90
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,918
I've I've been doing the stuff I've been

91
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,798
doing software hacking right you know

92
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:23,639
and Network hacking like my whole since

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:27,388
I was like 12 so I created my first

94
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,310
Linux box when I was 13 so yeah it was

95
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,530
years ago but yeah like it it's just

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,090
it's very emotional to like be with the

97
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,659
community that I came from in the

98
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,859
beginning and we knew each other prior

99
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:44,310
to all this yeah that kind of changed

100
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,590
some things in my life yeah yeah yeah we

101
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:54,870
met at right next to the MIT campus in

102
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:56,250
2009 yeah yeah so what's it so how what

103
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,870
of your interactions with people here

104
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,630
have been like that do you feel like

105
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,190
part of this hacker community yeah I was

106
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,000
over at the hardware hacking table yeah

107
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,719
I saw me yeah working with raspberry

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,090
PI's so you want to talk more about what

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,190
you're up to with that or uh yeah sure

110
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:20,820
in general I am working with I mean I'm

111
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,919
actually trying to convert some drivers

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,860
that are written in C into rust so that

113
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,359
way I can actually use rusts to do like

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,520
the actual hardware part I'm also

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,070
working on trying to get the

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,960
communications between between the

117
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,760
raspberry PI's but I'm using like

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,760
different hardware so I'm experimenting

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,849
with different

120
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,060
Hardware types so there's a like a

121
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,070
diesel I mean SDR is like now a big

122
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,690
thing yeah I've been playing like

123
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,420
there's been leaps and bounds in like

124
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,440
how affordable software-defined radio

125
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,480
has been so yeah and obviously kind of a

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,969
new language as well oh it's great I

127
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,940
used to I used to be the see person

128
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,630
right like told me yeah I was a C

129
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,030
programmer and I'm now a rest programmer

130
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,550
yeah so what else in the past eight

131
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,469
years technology wise has has been

132
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,080
really exciting to you to come out and

133
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,130
see like maybe about technological

134
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,260
advances well you know it's it's it's

135
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,860
actually the things that scare me you

136
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,810
know like I actually have seen a lot of

137
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,900
advances and developments in a lot of

138
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,380
the things that I was working on I

139
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,640
worked on I was actually doing a lot of

140
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,820
statistical analysis and predictive

141
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,560
analysis based upon statistics a lot of

142
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,599
work with that while I was in the

143
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,610
military and before that whenever I was

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,080
in the private sector and you know like

145
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,210
there's some scary stuff that we were

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,359
doing and you know it was just like not

147
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,859
primetime for this technology and and I

148
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,700
still think that you know like and we

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,990
shifted from you know a more primitive

150
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,990
mathematical construct to do predictive

151
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,570
analysis to machine learning and you

152
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,580
know neural networks and I I now have a

153
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,230
box with a bunch of GPUs that just not

154
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,060
you know that that's why I happen you

155
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,030
know like and some you know I'm using

156
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,480
like CUDA and you know these neural

157
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,580
networks and it's it's there's been so

158
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,610
much advancement in this area but it's

159
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,039
like how it get how it's getting used is

160
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,960
what scares me because we're not like

161
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,760
humans I don't feel like society and

162
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,120
humans have really worked out the ethics

163
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,159
of what we actually use these things in

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,470
applications for like I feel and I also

165
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,970
feel like the development cycle is so

166
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:46,420
fast and it's working so so aggressively

167
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,220
towards you know selling products or you

168
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,580
know killing people that it's you know

169
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,700
it's just like like what are we doing

170
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,740
like we have a

171
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,360
it's this far with this technology and

172
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,350
you know the first thing that we do is

173
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,820
we use it to try to kill people so yeah

174
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,340
so there is probably a lot of people in

175
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,070
the audience who work at technology

176
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,719
companies developing things like or

177
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,640
similar to the things you just mentioned

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,710
yeah so what what's your advice for

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,210
people who are in that role and may have

180
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,609
ethical concerns about their work my

181
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:24,140
advice to them is make your own

182
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,700
decisions we you know we as developers

183
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,930
understand the technology that we're

184
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,880
using often but also think about the

185
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,850
ethical implications of that technology

186
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,059
that you're working on we're not just

187
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:43,250
making tools and we're not just

188
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:45,170
developing software you know we are what

189
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,020
you know this software is impacting the

190
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,699
entire you know huge set the huge

191
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,760
segments of the population now you know

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,440
and so when we when we do these things

193
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,120
and you know it's and it's becoming more

194
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,930
life-and-death you know it's becoming

195
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,300
more or you know just like credit

196
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,310
reporting you know and predictive and I

197
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,280
like predicting like whether or not

198
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,359
you're gonna be a criminal or you know

199
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:16,400
predictive policing as an other means

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,080
that we end up destroying people's lives

201
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,390
with the software that we make because

202
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,870
it's getting misused and mishandled but

203
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,510
we have like an we have an ethical

204
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,700
obligation to understand the the

205
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,650
implications of the software or did at

206
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,330
least discover and you know in the same

207
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,709
way that you know if you're a developer

208
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,110
you're gonna do the first thing that you

209
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,600
do if you're if you're a good software

210
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,200
engineer is do a feasibility assessment

211
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,820
and that there should be more to that

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,840
this should be like an ethical

213
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,580
assessment like what are the

214
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,180
implications of this technology gonna be

215
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,310
and how can we safeguard that or should

216
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,219
we even develop this should we even go

217
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,060
down this path you know and I think that

218
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:02,690
looking beyond the the requirements set

219
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,430
by companies or you know NGOs or the

220
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,270
government instead of looking at the

221
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,760
development requirements that you

222
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,430
that instead of hitting nose like think

223
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,750
about the broader implications and like

224
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,120
because they're probably not thinking

225
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,220
about that stuff either so I think that

226
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,410
we have you know especially because if

227
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,430
we iMovie and we also have the ability

228
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,160
to withhold our skills from these

229
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,410
systems you know and I know that's

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,240
asking a lot for people who make 200

231
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,670
grand a year and yeah but like it's 200

232
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,530
grand a year or you know a like are you

233
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,189
gonna be denying millions of people

234
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:45,480
access to I don't know like life credit

235
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:48,390
basic necessities food you know

236
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,950
political rights because like that's

237
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,220
what it that's what it's boiling down to

238
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,620
and you know the and you know and and I

239
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,940
think that you know I think that

240
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:03,360
companies also are you know that are

241
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:07,440
developing software that has unintended

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,080
consequences that are harmful across the

243
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,050
board but it's not because that's their

244
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,700
intent it's the fact that because they

245
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,949
didn't think this stuff out because

246
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,100
they're so focused on you know profits

247
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,990
that you know it's having these impacts

248
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,760
and you've already affected millions of

249
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,950
people and I you know like look at

250
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:31,040
voting I like look at you know voting

251
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:33,720
machines or and I'm thinking about

252
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,839
Facebook and you know Twitter with how

253
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,440
like you know how these social media

254
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,670
platforms are being used and abused and

255
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,470
how the data from that is being used and

256
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,089
abused and like it's these unintended

257
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,510
consequences of the systems with that we

258
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,460
make that are really having an impact

259
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,860
yeah so what about the case where you're

260
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,720
in an organization that's really driven

261
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,310
towards these goals like profit and

262
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,350
you're you feel like you're the only

263
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,479
person who cares about ethics or you

264
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,610
feel alone do you have advice for people

265
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,590
in that situation you probably

266
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,590
understand that situation more than

267
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:11,010
anyone else and you should base your

268
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:12,720
decisions off that experience that's the

269
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,819
best that I can say that's the best

270
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,070
advice I can give because not every

271
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,670
situation is the same every moral and

272
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,340
ethical dilemma is

273
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,079
is a quandary in and of itself there's

274
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,730
no be-all-end-all

275
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:31,160
you know one size fits all rule here and

276
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,900
and and you know we we have political

277
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,790
agency we have political power even as

278
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,680
software developers we have we have an

279
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,110
obligation but we also have this power

280
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,390
we have actual power and we can do

281
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,130
something about it and what you do is

282
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,910
gonna vary depending on what where you

283
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,610
fit in these systems but you know you

284
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,350
you will know what that is and you know

285
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,080
and I think that you should follow your

286
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,870
gut and follow your intuition in those

287
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,130
situations and that's the best that I

288
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,690
can say that's the best advice I can

289
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,650
give is do you know do something yeah

290
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,140
thank you

291
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:14,360
yeah I'm sure you're an inspiration to a

292
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:16,580
lot of us and there's more it's plenty

293
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,770
so switching gears a bit since you you

294
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,550
talked about politics you recently ran

295
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:25,010
for the Senate Maryland can you talk a

296
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,689
bit about what your motivations were for

297
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,180
doing that and how you picked the

298
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,600
particular set of issues to focus on

299
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,569
yeah I wanted to put you know I wanted

300
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,690
to use the political process to get

301
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:43,040
ideas out there and to move and shape

302
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:45,110
the conversation when you when you run

303
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,069
for political office you're given a

304
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,500
platform and I wanted to be able to say

305
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,730
the things that I believe not not the

306
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,460
things that I think will get me elected

307
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,040
but the things that I believe and bring

308
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,340
them to the table you know things like

309
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:06,380
abolish ice things like you know closed

310
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:09,710
prisons things like things like defund

311
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,450
police departments and you know I I

312
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,160
believe in these things and I think that

313
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,460
they should be on the table and that was

314
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,199
why I ran and you know and I made it I

315
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,500
made a very calculated decision I

316
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:24,260
remember I had my I had my you know like

317
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:29,330
I basically had a small campaign staff

318
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:32,150
and we had a meeting together in before

319
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,720
we announced and I am

320
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,250
and shortly after we announced and we

321
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,930
made you know we made that like I was

322
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,880
like you know like what what do we do

323
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:46,370
like should we you know try it should we

324
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,529
should we change our principles you know

325
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,160
in order to try and win and then use

326
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,580
like an actual weight like you use like

327
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,060
you know a Senate office to do these

328
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,010
things or do we want to not change our

329
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,189
principles say the things we want to say

330
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:07,010
do the things that we want to do and and

331
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,170
and start from there and I think we all

332
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,689
made it we all came to a consensus that

333
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,979
we were gonna move forward with saying

334
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:21,650
the things that we actually believe

335
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:22,970
that's awesome and yeah so what did you

336
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,910
what did you learn from the whole

337
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,380
experience and what are your next steps

338
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,390
well I you know it was actually funny

339
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,200
because I went and I I went out

340
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,670
canvassing and I didn't do it like with

341
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,910
as a photo-op moment or anything like

342
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,709
that

343
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,810
I didn't post any photos of it on

344
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,180
Twitter I didn't talk about it you know

345
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,810
publicly but I I did actually go out

346
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,819
canvassing and so I went all across the

347
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,410
state of Maryland particularly in

348
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,410
Baltimore and I just knocked on people's

349
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,380
doors and you know registered voters and

350
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:58,120
I just said hey you know what are the

351
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:01,490
issues you care about and and that was

352
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,520
it was tough because I got grilled by I

353
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,740
got grilled by some real genuine people

354
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,250
who have real issues and real problems

355
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:15,110
and and I didn't always have the answer

356
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:17,300
and you know and I'm really more of an

357
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,160
activist I'm not a politician I don't I

358
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,000
kind of suck at being a politician

359
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:28,250
honestly I'm way better being a sysadmin

360
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,070
than a politician so so you know I know

361
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,990
you know so like sitted standing on the

362
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,670
doorstep of somebody who has real

363
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,760
problems and real issues and is

364
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:42,140
struggling and being grilled by them and

365
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,180
really intelligently the the it wasn't

366
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,860
journalists who asked me the most the

367
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,109
most profound questions it

368
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,120
standing on somebody's doorstep where

369
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,040
people feel really confident and having

370
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,740
them ask you to a tough question and

371
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,480
being put on the spot like that that was

372
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,730
one of the toughest things ever I've

373
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
ever done and I had to openly admit

374
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,440
sometimes like I don't have an answer

375
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,549
it's really complicated I have never

376
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,500
thought about that before uh I want to

377
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:11,660
get back to you like I'd like to email

378
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,000
you back or send a letter back you know

379
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,910
and maybe come up with it with an answer

380
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
but I don't know and that was tough to

381
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,540
say it was tough to be grilled on

382
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,000
somebody's doorstep could you give some

383
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,720
examples of the questions people asked

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,059
you yeah people had these stories they

385
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,919
have these like powerful emotional

386
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,030
stories about you know the struggles

387
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,559
they're going through and I remember I

388
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:40,610
talked on the porch with a with a woman

389
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,639
in she was an elderly lady a woman of

390
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,799
color in Baltimore and I stood on her

391
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,270
porch and she wouldn't she wouldn't open

392
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,000
the door so we talked through the screen

393
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,620
door and I was I was okay with that and

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,660
she you know like she's like oh yeah

395
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,320
I've been I've been voting for 40 years

396
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,669
and I'm sick and tired of it I you know

397
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,500
I've been voting and voting and voting

398
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,570
and things just get progressively worse

399
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,220
they get progressively worse in my

400
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,320
community they get worse and worse and

401
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,540
worse and all that you know all these

402
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,100
politicians come and they knock on my

403
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,809
door and they they say the same things

404
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,178
and they make the same promises and they

405
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,280
tell me all these you know they give

406
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:19,580
they say they're gonna give the world to

407
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,990
us and then they never do and and I

408
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:29,199
didn't want to be the person who did the

409
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:29,200
same thing so that was

410
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,980
so you know I didn't make her any

411
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:43,990
promises and I didn't tell her any BS so

412
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,220
that you know I was tough to hear that

413
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,519
story you know and she had like a

414
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,620
daughter who you know got cancer and

415
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:54,220
needed health care and it was too

416
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,469
expensive and you know like just like

417
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,850
that's an anecdote but like doing this

418
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,929
like I did this a couple hundred times

419
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,850
you know I did this several hundred

420
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:06,190
times and so everybody had like

421
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:08,740
something powerful like this did that

422
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,279
experience change or impact your

423
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:18,880
politics in any way was the fact that

424
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:21,970
had on you yeah you know I was you know

425
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,510
I think that we have a political system

426
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,200
that is inherently unfair that is

427
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,570
inherently biased and is really tough

428
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,429
and intense to like it work in and it's

429
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,129
an environment that closes you know it

430
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,990
closes resources off to people and makes

431
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,789
it inaccessible and you can't you can't

432
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,519
you can't get these ideas out there

433
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,279
because like the price of running a

434
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,289
campaign isn't is immense you know the

435
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,409
price of hiring staff is immense and

436
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:55,179
like getting even you know getting even

437
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:56,620
in the door is so difficult and I just I

438
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,960
don't I don't have a whole lot of

439
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,939
confidence in you know the American

440
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,440
political system and I think that there

441
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,019
are other political systems that

442
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,260
obviously have a bet have a better

443
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:10,330
balance that I think that we should

444
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,860
think about and we should try you know

445
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:16,408
and I think that the I think that

446
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,209
campaign finances and the expectation of

447
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:21,190
having advertising and you know like

448
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,169
enormous amounts of advertising for

449
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,960
budgets I mean which I didn't I didn't

450
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:28,809
advertise I we did we didn't put you

451
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,919
know we didn't buy any television

452
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:35,168
advertising slots so and we didn't have

453
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,399
those like I I didn't feel you know

454
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:38,590
comfortable from an environmental

455
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:41,209
standpoint to have yard science I

456
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,668
thought like I don't want to leave a

457
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,299
bazillion yard signs and like poles in

458
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:50,179
the ground and so like you know we

459
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:53,450
decided not to go with with you know

460
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:55,309
like doing these things and but you in

461
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,350
order for you to have traction you know

462
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,990
in the system that we have you know

463
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,639
you're expected to have these things so

464
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,710
and I kept on getting like people kept

465
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,480
on asking me like like why aren't you

466
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,919
really running and I'm like well I am

467
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,529
it's just like I'm doing it in my own

468
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,179
way I'm doing I'm not doing these things

469
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,679
and I'm consciously not doing these

470
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:15,140
things that you expect the campaign to

471
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,270
do because you know I thought you know I

472
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,140
thought I'd give it a try and you know I

473
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:23,330
did it and it didn't work

474
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:25,399
so you know you know and I don't I don't

475
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,889
think that that that you know the I

476
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:30,979
think that the bar is too high hmm if

477
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,440
you had to run again well not that you

478
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,789
would ever before so obviously yeah but

479
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
would you so would you do things

480
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,200
differently what you do more of the

481
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,779
traditional politician route I don't

482
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,059
know you know and I've really thought

483
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:47,929
about it and like I said I'm actually a

484
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:50,120
way better activists and sysadmin um you

485
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:54,440
know we had great email like our email

486
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:59,000
works our our 30l our website was very

487
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:11,799
secure Russia did not get any of our

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:11,799
emails that's awesome so there might

489
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:19,250
sense since the last election in 2016

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,110
I've heard more and more like hackers

491
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,970
and people who aren't traditionally

492
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,250
politicians without you know politics

493
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,649
background expressed interest in running

494
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,990
for office whether it's at a local level

495
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,840
or something higher up than that do you

496
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,539
have advice for those people who aren't

497
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,879
from politics and want to get elected if

498
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,220
you go down the traditional route it

499
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,490
will change you you'll have to change

500
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,260
your principles you have to to let go of

501
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,899
some of the things that you care about

502
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,049
in order to fit in and in order for you

503
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:53,189
to be accepted in this environment and

504
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:55,950
that's unfair and it's improper but

505
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,990
that's that's what they expect you know

506
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,180
and I think it's funny whenever like

507
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,710
these whenever like the Maryland DNC

508
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,990
says like oh yeah we're not gonna

509
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,520
interfere you know but then they

510
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,050
interfere covertly you know

511
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,040
behind-the-scenes you know like that's

512
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,810
just you know you know it's it's like

513
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,850
that this is like if you if you if you

514
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,010
have actual principles you will find it

515
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,580
incredibly hard

516
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:25,830
Wow so like you have to either have to

517
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:29,070
let go of those or I mean good luck

518
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,629
pretty depressing I mean it is and I

519
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:36,540
think that's you know like that was

520
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:38,930
something that I learned yeah so earlier

521
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,670
this year you tweeted something like

522
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:44,550
voting doesn't change anything I was

523
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,020
yeah go stand by that and like if so

524
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,570
what do you mean like well yeah I'll

525
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,120
answer other than voting you know III

526
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,370
wrote those tweets after a really rough

527
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,620
weekend with canvassing and I was

528
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,530
actually really I was actually really

529
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,810
kind of wore out and depressed and that

530
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,230
was what people were telling me you know

531
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:06,929
that this can consistently person after

532
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,170
person was telling me I vote and I vote

533
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:14,070
and I vote and nothing ever you know not

534
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:17,250
nothing nothing's getting better and so

535
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,560
that you know the the I just went with

536
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,080
that and I think that we should be

537
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,429
demanding more we should be asking more

538
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,970
and I think that we should be depending

539
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,920
less on these institutions to solve our

540
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:33,090
problems I mean we have communities we

541
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:35,040
have people to depend on we have people

542
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,590
that if we just look out for one another

543
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,680
you know we might be able to solve some

544
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,820
of these problems and I think that

545
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:47,160
that's that's what I'm trying to get out

546
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,929
with that is is you know tyent you know

547
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,700
and yeah that was base that was based

548
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,950
off of what I was hearing again and

549
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:57,990
again and you know it was it was a tough

550
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:01,050
moment for me because like I I felt less

551
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:05,950
confidence in the system that we have

552
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:08,440
and so do a lot of people and I was just

553
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,630
saying that I was just conveying the

554
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,030
fact that so many people think this now

555
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,920
yeah so you're saying people should do

556
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,860
more for each other you know form

557
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:25,480
stronger yeah and I think that I think

558
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:28,419
that we have each other and that's

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,080
that's enough isn't it like do we need

560
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:34,420
do we need these huge institutional

561
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,189
bodies to tell to tell us how did how to

562
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,690
like run our communities and like

563
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,840
because like every single tool you know

564
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,550
every single community that I saw got

565
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,470
you know in you know every time that the

566
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,030
the state or federal government got

567
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,520
involved like it just messed everything

568
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,200
up even worse you know like you know

569
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,230
like and this was consistent across the

570
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,590
board you know rural places like out

571
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,960
near Hagerstown or urban places like

572
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,730
Baltimore or suburban places like

573
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,220
Montgomery County you know like there

574
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,380
were tons of places or you know and

575
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,970
coastal you know coastal towns you know

576
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,260
like again and again you know but it was

577
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,690
different that the problems were

578
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,210
different each time but it was fun but

579
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,650
what was funny was that and the the

580
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,570
people affected were different each time

581
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,640
but was funny is that it was the same

582
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,050
institutions causing the same problem

583
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,710
like different problems in different

584
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,480
locations and I think that you know and

585
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,760
and this goes into like the notion of

586
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,170
intersectionality you know like if we

587
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,629
can get all these groups to come

588
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,430
together and agree on on making a

589
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,980
difference in our own communities and

590
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,200
then you know like supporting each other

591
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,210
across across the state or even across

592
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,360
the world you know then we can

593
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,850
accomplish so much more yeah are you

594
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,790
interested in becoming more of a like a

595
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:52,060
community organizer I mean well I am a

596
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:54,460
community organizer I'm involved in I

597
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:57,010
try to be involved as involved as

598
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,800
possible and the various communities

599
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:02,320
that I'm a part of you know often

600
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,780
quietly you know I don't you know like I

601
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,250
just I will show up in the back of you

602
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,730
know meeting or I'll support you know

603
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,290
like I do jail and prisoner support

604
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,680
which is the most I think that's the

605
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,420
most passionate thing that I do is as I

606
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,770
try our light write letters to prisoners

607
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,230
I try to encourage people to write

608
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,360
letters

609
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,270
prisoners I try to encourage people to

610
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,918
you know continue to reach out and it's

611
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,540
you know and then also like whenever you

612
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,220
get released from prison it's not it's

613
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,720
not an easy deal like you know like I

614
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,000
had all I had access to all these

615
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,100
resources and all this like I'm a really

616
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,740
well-known person but like most people

617
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,110
don't have that and you know we should

618
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:52,220
be providing this to people from our

619
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:54,559
communities was that largely informed by

620
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,419
your own experiences in prison and right

621
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,668
and facing trial

622
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:01,880
you know I attended many of the like I

623
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:05,270
had a few friends who were on trial from

624
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:10,340
the j-20 case you know so 200 people

625
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:13,040
arrested on an auger a Shinde of 2017

626
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,899
mostly for and their charge was

627
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,500
conspiracy and was for wearing all black

628
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:21,140
you know anybody who was wearing black

629
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,320
in this area that got kettled was

630
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,720
charged with conspiracy so I ended all

631
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,700
there I tended as many hearings as I

632
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,549
could back quietly in the back can

633
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,130
provided support and and I tweeted about

634
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:36,230
on occasion and like this is this is

635
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,429
what I do like it's it's what I enjoy

636
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,130
it's what I think it's what I'm

637
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,830
passionate I care about so I don't you

638
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,200
know and they they're at most most of

639
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,820
them are fine now so you know that's

640
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,450
charged most of the charges got dropped

641
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,450
so like we're thrilled about that

642
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,450
awesome

643
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,460
so you mentioned writing letters to

644
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,010
prisoners is there any other ways that

645
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,110
people here could support people in

646
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,389
prison yeah and you know I think the

647
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,479
most important I think the most

648
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:12,408
important thing that we can do is we can

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,090
stop writing people off you know like

650
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:17,250
it's really hard and it's really hard to

651
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,799
do that because even if you are

652
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,679
supportive like after about two or three

653
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,450
years you kind of forget about these you

654
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,190
know you forget about folks because you

655
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,000
don't see them all the time they're not

656
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:32,510
you know and and actually and I have I

657
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,320
have you know in activism I you know I I

658
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,720
see that you know there's a lot of

659
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,269
activism about you know police violence

660
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,980
and brutality and like and it's usually

661
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:42,539
focused on you know in the streets and

662
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,429
I'm just like well there's two point

663
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,919
there's two point two million people in

664
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,389
any time in prisoner or in prison in the

665
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,950
United States or in jails in the United

666
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,539
States and so there's state violence

667
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,389
happening there all the time you know

668
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:59,789
but often we forget about that and you

669
00:29:54,389 --> 00:30:01,139
know that you know like you know

670
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,379
what-what you know it's funny whenever I

671
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:05,699
was in prison I actually get asked this

672
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,100
a lot you know people are like oh well

673
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,750
there's there's all these like violent

674
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,178
scary people in prison and you're not

675
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,919
like violent and scary and I'm like the

676
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,690
mo the most violent and scary people

677
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,260
that I encountered in prison were the

678
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:24,110
prison guards time and time again so I

679
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:27,269
[Applause]

680
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,529
you know like like you know whenever cut

681
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:30,899
you know whenever whenever these things

682
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,299
come whenever miss whenever mistakes

683
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,620
happen in society you know like we get

684
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,960
hammered for it whenever the government

685
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,459
makes them miss does a terrible thing or

686
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:46,320
makes a mistake like it just like or

687
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:53,429
whatever so yeah alright let's lifting

688
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:55,049
things yeah so so I don't want to talk

689
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,850
too much about prison if you don't want

690
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:59,639
to but well I mean like let's talk about

691
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,928
I mean you came to visit me I did come

692
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,549
to visit you you're one of the few

693
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,620
people who could cuz we you knew me

694
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,950
before yeah so there's this um there's

695
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:10,018
this really stupid rule that

696
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,490
at least a military prison oh the in

697
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,590
this particular one this in this

698
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,559
particular place Leavenworth

699
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,600
you could only visit Chelsea if you if

700
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,139
you if she could prove that she knew you

701
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,580
before incarceration which is kind of

702
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,129
difficult yeah

703
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,899
and so like that that got rid of a lot

704
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,750
of people right off the bat a lot of

705
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:33,059
support you know because a lot of people

706
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,950
came out and we're supportive so a lot

707
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,029
of the supporters that came together you

708
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,399
know were people that I didn't

709
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,929
necessarily know before you know going

710
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,689
to prison but yeah I mean you were

711
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,399
different in the fact that you know we

712
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,169
we were both I mean you were an mi t--'s

713
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,459
you know physics student at the time and

714
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:50,340
I was like oh yeah I'm really into

715
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,309
physics I wanted to yeah you know like

716
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,230
that didn't work out but it's not too

717
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:57,269
late though I mean everything I'm not

718
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,010
interested in in physics as much as I

719
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:02,220
used to be I'm less interested the math

720
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,679
but now I'm doing more like cryptography

721
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,080
yeah so you have enough interest in

722
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,929
quantum or post quantum cryptography I I

723
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,490
do and so I've read an enormous number

724
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,720
of papers and I studied an enormous

725
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,149
number of papers while I was in prison

726
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,919
and it's funny like there was a lot of

727
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,959
stuff we couldn't get into prison

728
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,730
because you know there's like rules and

729
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,090
censorship and all this stuff so like

730
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,929
like of all the things to like actually

731
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:30,320
make it into prison was like really

732
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:33,960
advanced like brand-new cryptograph

733
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,149
photography paper's like lattice base

734
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,250
cryptography real ring learning with

735
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:39,689
errors type stuff and you think they

736
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,159
just didn't understand it so they're

737
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,110
like what I mean there's like what is

738
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,720
this it's math it looks like math all

739
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,850
right there's like Greek all over it

740
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,100
right so if someone wanted to send you

741
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,360
like a really secret message all they

742
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,370
had to do is hide it in like a

743
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,908
cryptography paper I mean I'm not gonna

744
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:58,908
get to you I'm not gonna suggest that

745
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:06,210
but yeah like I just thought that with

746
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:08,309
all the things well yeah like you know

747
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,529
you know so I studied a lot of this

748
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,940
stuff while I was in prepped up to date

749
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,320
with Kurt with most with a lot of things

750
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,299
going on in cryptography while I was in

751
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,260
prison and I tried writing code but it

752
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,049
was a little hot it was a little tough

753
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,810
without without a computer here's just

754
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:25,500
like pen and pencil and paper a lot of

755
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:28,919
I was using through a friend over the

756
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,410
phone I had learned because I'd already

757
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:37,740
knew PI I already knew Python so what's

758
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:39,750
that math that numpy yeah one of these

759
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,310
Auto your favorite yeah knots modules

760
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,360
yeah there was this like Python like

761
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:47,850
math tool that I was using to like to do

762
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,530
most of my work and I you know I was

763
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,480
like two years ago so I can't quite see

764
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,090
you like ask someone to type it and yeah

765
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,790
interpreter and then like region result

766
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,070
yeah I had to ask an actual program and

767
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,440
it'd be like well like these like this

768
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,149
the assistant syntax really matters and

769
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,070
wuzzle a personally typing it up for me

770
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,330
so like this syntax really matters are

771
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,889
they doing wrong it's like indentations

772
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,830
are wrong

773
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:16,560
that sounds so yeah never gonna complain

774
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:18,630
about a coding interview ever again so I

775
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,820
thought it's not my favorite language by

776
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,500
the way yeah what is your favorite most

777
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,440
I aren't yeah it's rust I mean we just

778
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,480
talked about that yeah what was it like

779
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,700
to get out of prison and use a computer

780
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,340
for the first time you weren't you there

781
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:35,279
oh yeah I was well that was the first

782
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,480
time I pretty much like I mean it wasn't

783
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,370
the first time I'd used like a

784
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,409
electronic device it was like cell

785
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,569
phones before that like you know like

786
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,040
cell phones and because I didn't

787
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,760
actually the thing was I didn't own a

788
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,620
computer yet and my my lawyers were like

789
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,240
hey can we buy you a computer and I'm

790
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,569
like do you know how to buy a computer

791
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:57,990
that's really secure like I'm not gonna

792
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:00,450
order this online I'm like like you know

793
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:03,419
so what that was why I waited and I

794
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:05,370
waited until I got until y'all showed up

795
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,000
yeah I was like pack of we have like a

796
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:12,240
computer buying for Chelsea task force

797
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,610
it was an ordeal yeah it was yeah it's

798
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:20,009
super secure yeah it's not bad not bad

799
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,710
so what was did you like get right back

800
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:26,790
and are like coding and network admin

801
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:29,520
stuff or yeah why I had to catch up a

802
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:33,720
little bit um you know whenever comes to

803
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,590
like sysadmin stuff I wasn't as familiar

804
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,399
with like virtual machine platform

805
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:43,330
as I am now so now I use a crap-ton of

806
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,010
virtual machines and you know like

807
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,049
there's so much more capabilities in

808
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,670
terms of like network security and a lot

809
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,150
of advances and like there's a lot of

810
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:55,330
more warning systems and like mailing

811
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,010
lists for this kind of thing which I had

812
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,259
to like I had to catch up on like the

813
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,130
new vulnerabilities that have been

814
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:05,620
identified that didn't make national

815
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:07,390
headlines and and also I think that you

816
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,100
know like I mean I docker is brand new

817
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,839
and I'd never used the docker container

818
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,920
before and now I used those containers

819
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:19,840
all the time so yeah you know like it

820
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,640
was just it was Manan you know like but

821
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,580
here's the funny thing is like it is

822
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,879
like having this like back background

823
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,740
like going back to the late 90s in like

824
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,200
you know in computers and technology

825
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,060
meant that you know it was like building

826
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,410
on top of this already previous

827
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,029
knowledge it wasn't like be I was being

828
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,920
introduced to things I was actually like

829
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,420
things are actually easier now and it

830
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,520
was just like that's funny like I

831
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,230
thought I thought maybe you know things

832
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,240
would be harder but actually a lot of

833
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,490
stuff that I thought gosh wouldn't it be

834
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,169
great if this was automated or now

835
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:58,180
automated yeah I guess a lot happened in

836
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:59,560
seven years yeah yeah you know and like

837
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,060
it's so it's so great like I just have

838
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,630
to do a doctor pull and I'm like yep I

839
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,670
got that post gray server so are you

840
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,700
interested in doing more like hacker

841
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:13,810
stuff software engineering submitting

842
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,500
yeah so I've shifted my interests to I

843
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:23,799
mean like I said hardware hacking so

844
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:26,950
water as berry pies I have probably have

845
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,810
about 20 right now so Wow

846
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:33,399
using it for various purposes my

847
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:37,480
favorite is the SNES and n64 ROM

848
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,970
emulator I've hooked up to my TV that's

849
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:46,140
fine how do you pick projects to work on

850
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:49,370
space either an interest or an actual

851
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,250
demand so

852
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:55,080
many of the projects that I work on now

853
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,150
and you know I started doing small-scale

854
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,590
projects first now I'm doing like medium

855
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:03,000
term like stuff that's gonna take me a

856
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:04,980
couple months or you know like and so I

857
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,660
have long I have long term like goals

858
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:11,460
and like IIIi can't I can never tell if

859
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,330
it's if it's gonna be the moment to like

860
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,130
reveal my secret github account but you

861
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,110
know like I'm not I'm not like I don't

862
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,030
feel coughs like I don't feel confident

863
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,950
enough and I worry that you know like if

864
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,630
everybody knows that this is the code

865
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,399
that I'm writing that it you know like

866
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,960
people think it's better somehow you

867
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,520
know it's like it's like the state you

868
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,870
know Stephen King like wrote as like

869
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,330
somebody else for like three years and

870
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,190
his book he's like books under not under

871
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,480
his name like didn't sell and like as

872
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,830
soon as people found out with Stephen

873
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,160
King books it was selling all over the

874
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,920
place you know I'm just worried I'm just

875
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,339
worried that about that so yeah I'm just

876
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,920
gonna I want to be an actual like I want

877
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,160
people to just use the code and like

878
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,810
work on the code and and be able to work

879
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,490
on that without the knowledge that you

880
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,840
know like my name is attached mmm

881
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,259
interesting so are you going to release

882
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:05,070
some projects anonymously in the future

883
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,080
well I'm already doing that but you know

884
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,810
they're they're very small you know like

885
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,400
we're not I mean it's it's it's mostly I

886
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:14,549
mean honestly it's it's mostly sub

887
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,530
components that like prerequisites that

888
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,740
because but because I'm doing because

889
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:22,170
I'm programming and rust I find that a

890
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,569
lot of the C wrappers for you know like

891
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:28,530
the wrappers for rust to go to a C

892
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:31,410
library are you know not not up to par

893
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,770
yet mm-hm so I've been contributing to

894
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:37,170
some of those projects or in some cases

895
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:40,950
if it's a small enough library I'll just

896
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,870
rewrite the library and I not all of

897
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,089
them have been posted to you know

898
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,790
they're not all cargo container not all

899
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:50,190
cargo packages but like I'm certainly

900
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,920
thinking about the things that I may

901
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,320
eventually become their own cargo pack

902
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,510
packages but I am contributing as it as

903
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,630
it stands to rust development that's

904
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,400
awesome do you think you would pursue a

905
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:07,230
career in software development

906
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:13,170
someday I mean I don't know is it

907
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:17,460
anybody hiring a couple hands in the

908
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,589
audience yeah so but yeah like I'm still

909
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,849
you know I'm I'm kind of more of a

910
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:26,190
public figure right now so I do plan on

911
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,960
you know and I am transitioning more and

912
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,839
more to doing my own work you know

913
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,539
eventually what I want to do is I want

914
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,880
to be able to write a white paper and

915
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,740
maybe you know either a security or a

916
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,930
white paper or like you know something

917
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:45,000
along those lines actually be able to

918
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:47,069
write something and then you know have

919
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,309
it stand on its own I want to you know

920
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:52,140
III you know like yeah like I'm here

921
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,930
today because of what happened you know

922
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,058
to you know eight years ago but you know

923
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,779
I you know I still have things that I

924
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,980
can contribute I still have I still have

925
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:03,329
insight I still have experience and I

926
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,150
still have knowledge and I still have an

927
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:07,710
interest in this stuff so y'all y'all

928
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,859
are gonna start seeing some interesting

929
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:16,410
things coming from me in the future

930
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:19,038
awesome so excited for that so what is

931
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:25,319
your day-to-day life been like recently

932
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:30,440
super busy chaos I never know what city

933
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:33,980
I'm gonna wake up in I've been out to I

934
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,319
mean I was just at Roskilde and Denmark

935
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:41,369
like a couple weeks ago a couple of

936
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:45,509
weeks before that I was in Berlin I saw

937
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:48,720
some of our friends there and before

938
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:52,170
that I was after that I was in Italy for

939
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,629
a while and and then I've been all over

940
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:59,670
the US I mean we met up a couple times

941
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:02,640
and SF and and you know and even though

942
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,140
I've settled I've mostly settled in

943
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,029
where where I used to live

944
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,819
Mon you know Montgomery County Maryland

945
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:12,000
and and I'm planning on staying there

946
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:15,150
for a while but I feel like I'm

947
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,960
commuting an awful lot across the

948
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,440
country

949
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,380
so I spent an awful lot of time in New

950
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,210
York probably about a third of my life

951
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:27,600
so far like out of prison has been spent

952
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:30,210
in New York Wow so I know initially you

953
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,490
had some trouble with international

954
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:34,740
travel oh yeah I tried to go to Canada

955
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,629
and they banned me forever

956
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,609
are you still banned yeah they said

957
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:43,350
forever and then they're like actually

958
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:47,190
you know maybe sometimes just when we

959
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:49,230
feel like it yeah man and there's still

960
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,260
there's still a fight to get like gain

961
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:54,060
full admissibility where I like just

962
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,250
walk I'm just like hey here's my

963
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:00,420
passport and then walk across as it

964
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,140
stands I have to ask for like permission

965
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,260
first

966
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,470
for Canada for every for every single

967
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,870
time have to ask Canada yeah so I have

968
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:12,270
to like put in like a full visa request

969
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,710
every single time as it stands mm-hmm

970
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,500
and I just did this when I went to

971
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,720
Montreal a few weeks ago have you had

972
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,480
trouble with other border crossings or

973
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,339
no the U has been very friendly Wow yeah

974
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,840
I'm just like okay like I'm in Europe

975
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:31,320
all right do you get recognized a lot

976
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:35,160
when you're just on the street or events

977
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:38,430
yeah I do I'm not used to that mm-hmm

978
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,170
I'm not used to that one bit you know

979
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,620
and and and I work you know I worry

980
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,360
about just a little bit because I like

981
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,940
to walk down the street as a normal

982
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,350
person and I'm just like I'm very you

983
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,000
know I mean I walk around the conference

984
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,350
and I'm just like hey you know like I'm

985
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,630
just hanging out you know doing stuff

986
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:57,690
and you know having a lot of people come

987
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:00,720
up to me it can be it's great but it's

988
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:02,190
also like like it you know it gets in

989
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,080
the way a little bit sometimes you know

990
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,190
especially whenever I'm like commuting

991
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,020
on the metro and I'm like I'm really

992
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,850
late right now and somebody's like hey

993
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,530
well can we take a selfie I'm like yeah

994
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:15,420
sure really really fast and and yeah

995
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,710
like or can we get on the train first or

996
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,030
you know something like that and it's

997
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,560
like this isn't my stop and I'm like

998
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:24,720
we'll just come along for one stop and

999
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:26,070
come back yeah so yeah it's it's it's a

1000
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,359
lot and you know I think that there's a

1001
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,359
lot of expectations that have been

1002
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,779
placed on me

1003
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:34,869
you know and I just like I mean I was 22

1004
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:37,299
when I got locked up and I spent eight

1005
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:39,880
years of my life in prison like you know

1006
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,920
and it sounds cliche but prisons all I

1007
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:47,289
know I mean that's really true it's

1008
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,789
actually true so I'm making a lot of

1009
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:51,160
like there's a lot of new things that I

1010
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:53,529
am learning um like I had never rented

1011
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,890
my own place before like that's like now

1012
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:59,470
you know now I pay rent I pay bills and

1013
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,210
I you know I I went from being you know

1014
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:05,799
homeless to living with my aunt like

1015
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:08,920
being in the military so like I either I

1016
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:11,288
never had my own place to live in before

1017
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:15,720
and so like this is the first time I'm

1018
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:18,039
living out on my own and and actually I

1019
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,799
want to stay and I want to talk a little

1020
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:24,549
bit about like my adjustment because

1021
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:26,980
it's been really hard and I'm really

1022
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:32,529
only starting to grasp how hard it's

1023
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:35,920
been you know I I you know I've been

1024
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:39,220
kind of weak like I'm I'm really

1025
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,470
struggling sometimes because I spent a

1026
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,589
year in solitary confinement and so I

1027
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:47,200
have some anxieties and fears associated

1028
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:51,339
with that that I that I don't like to

1029
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,288
talk about but you know and I and I

1030
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:57,220
there's like just like social stuff that

1031
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:59,049
I'm used to like you know you know like

1032
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,629
prison dynamics like prison social

1033
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:03,279
dynamics and how you know like assertive

1034
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:06,009
and aggressive you have to be in order

1035
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:07,779
to interact with people is I think you

1036
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:12,789
know I can be a little forward sometimes

1037
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:16,569
in a little blunt sometimes and and yeah

1038
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:18,519
like it like like sometimes and I've

1039
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:21,910
actually done this like I did this a few

1040
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:25,720
months ago I I got up in the middle of

1041
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:27,279
the night and I felt lonely and I was in

1042
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,308
my own apartment that was in my bedroom

1043
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:32,619
and I felt the temptation to like beat

1044
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:36,520
on the wall and just say hey how's it

1045
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:38,980
going and I was just like

1046
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,170
like that was normal for me at one point

1047
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,120
in my life and it's not anymore and I

1048
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,820
just I you know it was kind of I was a

1049
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,380
it's like living on my own like is the

1050
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,350
first time that I've never been around

1051
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,760
people for like years on like you for

1052
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,330
years on end I mean except for that

1053
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,350
period in solitary confinement in 2010

1054
00:46:54,330 --> 00:47:01,420
and early 2011 I was around lots of

1055
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,279
people and I got used to that and I

1056
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,250
enjoyed the communal environment you

1057
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,300
know you know and and you know like yeah

1058
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,930
it doesn't have to be a prison

1059
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,130
environment for it to be communal but

1060
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,419
but you know I did you know I didn't

1061
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,420
enjoy the camaraderie and you know like

1062
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:24,370
activism can happen in prison and people

1063
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,120
can be like people could be power people

1064
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,240
have power even if in prison and

1065
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,049
[Music]

1066
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,680
especially against you know the prison

1067
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,920
system

1068
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,399
you know like multiple occasions when I

1069
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,800
was in prison like I saw completely

1070
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,790
spontaneously an independent of any like

1071
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,140
you know of anything else people see it

1072
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,970
you know like like guards would come up

1073
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,170
to somebody and sometimes it would be

1074
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,490
even somebody that people don't like

1075
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,470
they're like I don't really like this

1076
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,970
person you know and then like but as

1077
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,560
soon as like the guards would start

1078
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,850
screwing with this person there'd be

1079
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,060
like eight or nine people would be like

1080
00:47:54,850 --> 00:48:00,339
hey back off you know so you know like

1081
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:03,040
prison you know like that works and it's

1082
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,900
effective and you know and like having

1083
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,000
that camaraderie and knowing that people

1084
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,210
are gonna come you know back you up and

1085
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,040
support you was very important and you

1086
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,690
know simple things like you know like

1087
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,960
simple simple things that were totally

1088
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,490
against the rules like you know we had

1089
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,590
to put it in these ration requests and

1090
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,359
we've talked about this on multiple

1091
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,270
occasions you know how difficult it was

1092
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,610
to like you had to submit paper like

1093
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:29,800
rations requests and you could not screw

1094
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,780
anything up on the form so if you

1095
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,960
screwed something up on the form then

1096
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,760
you didn't get your rations so this

1097
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,920
happened all the time you know people

1098
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:43,320
would be in need of shoes or new

1099
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,710
underwear or you know a uniform or

1100
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,410
toiletries toilet paper and they would

1101
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,000
have

1102
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,500
night these things because they didn't

1103
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,300
fill out the paperwork properly or

1104
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,220
oftentimes because they a lot you know

1105
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,190
the prison lost the paperwork which it's

1106
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:01,459
on them and so like we would get screwed

1107
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:04,340
out of stuff and so we have we created

1108
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,590
the system was like stockpiling we

1109
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,420
stockpiled are we you know what people

1110
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,160
who get did get their rations we got

1111
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,930
extra rations and we started stockpiling

1112
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,129
it and then you know whenever somebody

1113
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,629
got secured we'd be like hey here's

1114
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,750
here's some stuff you know like here you

1115
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,250
go like no big deal you know and like

1116
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,960
that's totally against the rules and the

1117
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,760
guns like you know the prison would

1118
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,220
crack down on that but it's like hey

1119
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,620
just give the guys shoes just give the

1120
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,620
guy to pace for crying out loud you know

1121
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,779
and you know like that's that that's

1122
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:36,140
some powerful mutual aid and assistance

1123
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:38,300
and and and and and really and this is

1124
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,150
happening in one of the like human

1125
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,580
beings are being treated like this and

1126
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,290
yet we're instead of being animals like

1127
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,180
we're coming together as like a

1128
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,650
community and that's where I learned

1129
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,490
about I was in prison was just how

1130
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:54,380
powerful you know you you know the the

1131
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:57,799
instinct of community really is that

1132
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:00,220
even in a place like prison and you know

1133
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,540
all across the board we have this

1134
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:12,509
ability

1135
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:15,310
[Applause]

1136
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:17,800
are you trying to recreate communities

1137
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:22,360
like that outside of now that you're out

1138
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:26,920
yeah you know and I see them now and I I

1139
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:28,600
didn't realize I had them sometimes and

1140
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,200
because I was like cut off for so long

1141
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,810
you know I value my relationships more

1142
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,259
than I did before I took them for

1143
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,330
granted

1144
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,950
I took my friendships for granted I took

1145
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:44,590
my family for granted I took I took a

1146
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,149
lot of things for granted and having

1147
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:50,110
them taken away has real you know made

1148
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:52,470
me realize the value of some of the not

1149
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,450
not physical things like you know like

1150
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:58,419
you know like if my computer goes like

1151
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:02,790
oh well you know it's like a physical

1152
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:06,070
object you know like it's replaceable

1153
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:07,920
the connections and that and valuable

1154
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,100
relationships that we have are not

1155
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,320
replaceable

1156
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,710
you know I value that more and I care

1157
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:17,710
about that more yeah do you feel

1158
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:21,520
supported in your everyday life yeah I'm

1159
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:24,670

1160
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:28,390

00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:30,130
thanks I think so I know in prison you

1162
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,170

1163
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,060
like a huge source of joy and support

1164

1169
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,280
don't have to spend this postage anymore

1170
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:52,630
and honestly like please don't float my

1171
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:55,720
p.o box I do I do I do have bills and

1172
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:58,330
packages that I need to find and you

1173
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,279
know and I'm still waiting on this FOIA

1174
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:04,090
request it's actually taken a couple

1175
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,530
years it's taken I started I as soon you

1176
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,270
know like a few months after the

1177
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,570
commutation was announced to book before

1178
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:13,000
I got out of prison I was minerally a

1179
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:15,280
request and I asked for hey you know

1180
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,520
like how how many like what's you what's

1181
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,050
y'all's count of how many letters I got

1182
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,940
because like what we've been hit like

1183
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,340
one of the estimates that we've gotten

1184
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,340
is

1185
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:28,490
is almost 300 thousand letters and

1186
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:32,000
packages yeah so it was pretty it was

1187
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,229
pretty astounding the the number and it

1188
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,610
was just such a it was it was such a

1189
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,710
huge ball I mean like at one point the

1190
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:39,440
prison actually was like up there like

1191
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:43,700
had to add another staff member to like

1192
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,500
go through it all um because like more

1193
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,210
than half of the prison's mail was my

1194
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:51,170
mail uh-huh

1195
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:53,750
Wow so you're saying that if we all just

1196
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,190
sent more mail and like DDoS the prison

1197
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,740
with mail they would have had just like

1198
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,690
keep hiring people to manage that yeah

1199
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,100
absolutely it's great because then they

1200
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,690
have too late and then they just gave up

1201
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,880
censoring some stuff they're just like

1202
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,380
they're just like okay or whatever like

1203
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,940
it's probably just like you know and the

1204
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,910
thing was is I was actually limited in

1205
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:15,080
what I could actually physically have so

1206
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:18,080
I was given like a time frame so like I

1207
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,420
was only allowed 40 letters in my cell

1208
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:24,250
at any one time I was also only allowed

1209
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:29,300
40 of any combination of books magazines

1210
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:33,950
or or any kind of publication like of

1211
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:36,530
that kind and that that was a very

1212
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:39,560
limiting number you know and so I had to

1213
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:42,320
be very judicious and what I selected to

1214
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:45,140
have at any one time and I always went

1215
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,500
through the mail but the the worst part

1216
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,290
about getting that amount of mail it was

1217
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,670
having to go through it all very quickly

1218
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,070
because I didn't have a whole lot of

1219
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,130
time to have it because by the end of

1220
00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:00,170
the night like when I couldn't

1221
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:02,390
physically take it to the because I had

1222
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,490
to throw it away I mean I I just didn't

1223
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:06,230
have it was way too expensive to like

1224
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:07,009
ship ship somewhere and I don't have

1225
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,750
anywhere to put it

1226
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,210
you know like it would fill up to

1227
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:14,390
storage when it's like two big storage

1228
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:15,620
units to try to fit it all and trying to

1229
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:18,529
get all you know trying to go through

1230
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:21,049
all this mail you know on a routine

1231
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:24,220
basis I I had to throw a lot of it away

1232
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:26,630
and I felt bad about that you know and

1233
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:30,189
but it was just the prison rules and if

1234
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:33,230
I kept it and I would've got wrote up so

1235
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:35,370
did you read every single letter that

1236
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:38,610
was I mean I tried to

1237
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:41,759
I think I mean one or two - up the

1238
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,800
cracks but I really tried and it was

1239
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,910
very powerful to me for me to go through

1240
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:50,460
that yeah and you know I would and I

1241
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:52,560
would I have like a system going I was

1242
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,800
like I'm going to like triage this so

1243
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,240
like these are card these are letters

1244
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,670
I'm gonna go through the cards first get

1245
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,439
rid of those I got the letters and I

1246
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,880
might be able to get away with you know

1247
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,950
like keeping some letters for a little

1248
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,530
longer so like I had the 40 limit so I

1249
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,299
tried to make that go faster luckily

1250
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,550
like legal materials are considered

1251
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,220
separate from that rule so like my legal

1252
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:17,970
material like box which was pretty big

1253
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,169
and I learned how to come you know

1254
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:21,209
information theory

1255
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,280
y'all like I was able to compress all

1256
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:26,130
that stuff and like I was able to get

1257
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:30,510
like like I actually had some times I

1258
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:32,430
would have like nine letter size the

1259
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,230
eight by eleven eight-and-a-half by

1260
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,690
eleven like sheets of paper but like

1261
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,400
blown like like shrunk so we I would

1262
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,860
have nine of them like and like I'm not

1263
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,660
a three by three row because I used the

1264
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,610
copier to like you know I'd be like hey

1265
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,560
here's 18 pages I'm gonna make it double

1266
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,940
sided with nine on each side and I'm

1267
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,590
like I would have to like squint to read

1268
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,230
it but like I would have an enormous

1269
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,060
amount of legal material so I 18 pages

1270
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,570
would be compressed to one page and I

1271
00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:00,570
was like this is like this is how this

1272
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:05,940
works was like the the prison tard up

1273
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:08,280
easy hard up easy to you know the people

1274
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,990
try to send you like items that you

1275
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,790
couldn't get and if so like what were

1276
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:14,959
the weirdest things like people tried oh

1277
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:18,360
I have no idea where to start with that

1278
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,640
like food yeah people try to send me

1279
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,460
food people try to send me lots of

1280
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:27,509
banned items like it was not a Kate

1281
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,250
it was occasional like but like over six

1282
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:32,220
years of not being allowed to

1283
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:36,080
confinement that that accumulated so

1284
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,080
yeah like I got a lot of weird stuff um

1285
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:40,380
I'm trying remember what the weirdest

1286
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,150
thing you know like it's it's really

1287
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,600
hard but um some some weird stuff that I

1288
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,600
got was

1289
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,930
I got I got a lot of I got a couple out

1290

1306
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,420
we're disposing of it you can't have

1307
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:47,080

1308
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:50,470
music and I probably still are were you

1309
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:52,540
like did you listen to what the latest

1310
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,430
hits were while in prison yeah well I

1311
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,370
mean I had access to the top 40 radio

1312
00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:00,669
station oh god we had we had the worst

1313
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:02,620
we had we had I couldn't actually we

1314
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,350
didn't have mp3 players so we couldn't

1315
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:08,589
get music so we had these like little

1316
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:10,900
radios and they were a clear acrylic

1317
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,340
cases so that way you could see like in

1318
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,980
case we were putting contraband in there

1319
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,750
or something like that so like these

1320
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,360
clear acrylic cases and I'm like I'm

1321
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,130
electronic like I'm I'm gonna lie I'm a

1322
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,810
hardware hacker like you won't see like

1323
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:31,840

00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:25,020
getting back into DJing

00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:27,330
ah no comment now yeah I'm already uh

1346
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,310
yeah I got my sense I just got some

1347
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,160
sense I actually went down I was at MOOC

1348
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:33,799
fast a few weeks ago and I MOOC fest and

1349
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,618
I got I actually got a couple

1350
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,270
synthesizer as while I was there so when

1351
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:42,240
I sit down and get around to doing it

1352
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,590
I'm gonna start doing some stuff and and

1353
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,720
you know it's great you're like there's

1354
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:47,310
so many more tools and and you know

1355
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,439
software emulation has gotten to the

1356
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:52,109
point where I don't need these analog

1357
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:55,230
systems as much

1358
00:59:52,109 --> 00:59:57,509
I don't you but I am like a hardware

1359
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:00,450
nerd so I you know I do appreciate like

1360
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:02,520
things like vacuum tubes and you know

1361
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,279
like I like to turn knobs I don't like

1362
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,200
to just use a screen you know so I

1363
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,600
actually like to physically touch things

1364
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,390
and wire things to connect them so I'm

1365
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,589
kind of nerd nerding out on that and you

1366
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,720
know I'm learning of the you know about

1367
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:19,109
new tools and techniques that electronic

1368
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:21,750
musicians are using now so I'm doing

1369
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:25,950
some exciting yeah I'm excited I'm gonna

1370
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:28,560
do some stuff and more importantly if I

1371
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:30,299
do do a DJ set and I do produce my own

1372
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:33,420
tracks I want to be clear on this I'm

1373
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:37,050
gonna use the pseudonym because I have I

1374
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,850
wanted to be actually good okay yeah I

1375
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,940
don't want to like pull like a Paris

1376
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:44,339
Hilton or anything and like use my name

1377
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:48,660
to be like look listen to this and like

1378
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:50,970
totally suck so I'd rather actually like

1379
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,410
get a feel for how people like the music

1380
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:57,540
first yeah

1381
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:59,368
send us her SoundCloud someday one of

1382
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,869
these days there's a plant there's

1383
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:03,119
actually a playlist out there like

1384
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:04,619
tracks I listen to well I don't know

1385
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,270
somebody somebody knows where it is I

1386
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,250
don't actually know I didn't put it up I

1387
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:10,630
put it as a list that came up with while

1388
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,859
I was in prison so

1389
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:16,609
and obviously I would add to it now

1390
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:18,348
because there's new there's new stuff so

1391
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:20,569
I think we've touched a lot on the topic

1392
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:22,369
of your fame and how that impacts your

1393
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:25,010
life and the ability to do things you

1394
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:28,520
like such as music and open source work

1395
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,720
right um do you find it like you know

1396
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,940
how do you feel about that it seems very

1397
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:38,629
limiting in a way I know I mean it's not

1398
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,099
limiting I just what I try to do is I

1399
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,830
try to remember where it came from

1400
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:46,790
mm-hmm and I'm constantly because you

1401
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:50,330
know going to prison for seven years

1402
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:52,730
make has may even has changed me in very

1403
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:54,770
profound ways I'm no I'm the same person

1404
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:59,270
but I also have these additional

1405
01:01:54,770 --> 01:02:02,540
experiences and and I always remember

1406
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:04,070
that and I have a few things to remind

1407
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,950
there's a few things in my living room

1408
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:08,599
to remind me of where it came from you

1409
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:10,580
know there's some reminders of the fact

1410
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,320
I was homeless there's some reminders

1411
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,690
the fact I went to prison there's some

1412
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,040
reminders the fact that at one time in

1413
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,630
my life I didn't have a clue what the

1414
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,580
hell I was talking about I thought I was

1415
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,750
smart I thought I was the smartest I

1416
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,150
thought it was a smartest kid in the

1417
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:25,820
room I'm just like okay I'm I'm I'm a

1418
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:36,490
genius and I'm the greatest and I I was

1419
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:39,650
so dumb you know and and yeah like I it

1420
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:42,140
I'm trying to remember where I came from

1421
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:44,510
but and use that as like a starting

1422
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,450
point like what do I care about what are

1423
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,820
my values you know because like the

1424
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:54,160
values that I have but make up Who I am

1425
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:58,270
or and that drives me mean more than

1426
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:02,299
should mean more than anything else and

1427
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:07,099
I'm I'm glad that I have people to keep

1428
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:09,349
me a checked as well you know like being

1429
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:11,270
in this position I could could you know

1430
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:13,040
I could have gone down the path of like

1431
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:16,250
hey like I'm like I don't know I'm gonna

1432
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,470
be a TV I'm gonna make a TV show I don't

1433
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:20,089
know like I mean they'll do it they'll

1434
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:22,080
put anything on these you know networks

1435
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:23,790
these days

1436
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,350
could a lot of documentary career like

1437
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:28,410
follow me the whole time and which I

1438
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:29,850
mean they'd I did have I do have a

1439
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,680
documentary crew that kind of followed

1440
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:35,069
me around but it wasn't like every

1441
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:38,120
aspect of my life and and I said no

1442
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:42,450
actually like leave us alone for that

1443
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:45,420
you know and yeah like there's a lot of

1444
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:47,279
reminders of the experiences that I've

1445
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,290
had and the people who have and I think

1446
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:56,310
the most important lesson I've learned

1447
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:58,410
on all this is is I trust and I love

1448
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,720
and I care about the people who stayed

1449
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,430
with me the whole time the people who

1450
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,200
didn't forget about me the people who

1451
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:08,399
kept sending letters and there was a

1452
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:13,439
very very specific set of people that I

1453
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:16,590
really care about who did that and and

1454
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:20,910
y'all sent me at the last hope y'all

1455
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:23,130
sent me several hundred cards so hope is

1456
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:25,009
definitely been of the people who come

1457
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:28,160
here I've definitely been on that list

1458
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:32,380
thank you guys woo

1459
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,379
[Applause]

1460
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:40,520
oh and 2012 and 2014 the same thing

1461
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:42,770
happened yeah very consistent every two

1462
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:46,369
years the hope flood yeah it was comes

1463
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:48,920
in what's going back to this audience so

1464
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:51,680
I it seems like a lot of people have

1465
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,869
been interested in engaging politically

1466
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,850
but aren't sure of the best way to do

1467
01:04:53,869 --> 01:05:03,200
that like where do you recommend people

1468
01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:09,670
focus their efforts we live in we live

1469
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:12,020
in really tough and trying times and it

1470
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:14,240
for some of us

1471
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:17,270
we've already you know like a lot a lot

1472
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,109
of people have known that you know that

1473
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,810
things have been going in this direction

1474
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:22,549
for quite some time I certainly figured

1475
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:27,910
it out by the time I went to Iraq in

1476
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:31,280
2010 I saw all the pieces of

1477
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:33,290
authoritarianism and all the tools that

1478
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,720
of the police stay in the military and

1479
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:37,640
the intelligence apparatus start to come

1480
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:41,089
together you know and coalesce and

1481
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,790
crystallize so a lot of these new things

1482
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,930
that came out you know in the early

1483
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:48,580
2000s or start really starting to

1484
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:52,220
solidify and you know this was under a

1485
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:55,580
liberal you know administration and I

1486
01:05:52,220 --> 01:06:00,799
realized that you know like this is

1487
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:02,390
happening and I think that the thing the

1488
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,520
important thing to remember is that we

1489
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:07,430
all have political agency we all have

1490
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:09,740
power and we all have the ability to do

1491
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,240
things and not yeah and I and I know I

1492
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:13,250
said this thing about developers and

1493
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,779
ethics but like that it really this

1494
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:17,540
applies to everyone at all in all

1495
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:19,730
aspects you know like do you know you

1496
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:22,190
know your situation better so like deuce

1497
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:23,420
do something like and you don't all you

1498
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,220
know like you have more political agency

1499
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:28,250
than going to a ballot box you have more

1500
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:30,439
political agency then you know then

1501
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,940
writing a letter or a petition or you

1502
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,190
know even going to a protest and

1503
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:37,730
carrying a sign you know you have way

1504
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:39,140
more than that and in a sense every

1505
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,119
decision that you make can be

1506
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:44,210
interpreted as a political decision you

1507
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,829
know whether or not you want to like

1508
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,469
whether or not you you

1509
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:50,450
want to like throw the I mean if you've

1510
01:06:48,469 --> 01:06:52,069
got a copy if you've got a cup and you

1511
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:53,839
want to throw it away or do you want to

1512
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:55,489
like if you've got a disposable Cup do

1513
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:57,859
you want threw it away or recycle it you

1514
01:06:55,489 --> 01:07:02,359
know like that like these kinds of like

1515
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:04,308
small everyday decisions and the people

1516
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:07,489
that we have to our left into our right

1517
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:09,349
the people that we have like let's look

1518
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:12,019
towards each other right now like that

1519
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:15,170
like there's no like there's nobody

1520
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:18,319
that's gonna come and save us from this

1521
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:20,479
grand huge authoritarian you know

1522
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,979
machine that's International and like

1523
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:24,049
you know like yeah we keep talking about

1524
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:26,930
the US but like this is happening all

1525
01:07:24,049 --> 01:07:28,940
across the world right now and and

1526
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,249
technology is really empowering some

1527
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:34,489
very dangerous people and and and in

1528
01:07:31,249 --> 01:07:37,368
very dangerous institutions and in order

1529
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:40,700
for us to combat that we have to look

1530
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:43,160
towards each other and and also nobody

1531
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:46,430
like nobody can give you hope that's in

1532
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:49,098
a like I I don't know how to tell you

1533
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:51,078
this but like you can't it's not

1534
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:53,479
something that's given to you it's not

1535
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:55,789
like a commodity like I have hope

1536
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:58,160
therefore I'm giving it unto you like

1537
01:07:55,789 --> 01:08:00,979
it's something that we have inherently

1538
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:03,649
inside of us you have to find still like

1539
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:05,538
and you know it's easy to forget that I

1540
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:07,099
learn you know I kept on having to

1541
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:10,219
relearn this while I was in prison like

1542
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:12,079
actually this is something like I'm

1543
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:13,279
gonna continue to I'm gonna

1544
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,319
continue to move forward I'm gonna

1545
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:17,359
continue to hope I'm gonna continue to

1546
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:19,729
maybe you know expect to make a

1547
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,049
difference and that's something that we

1548
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:24,408
should do especially in you know

1549
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:26,509
whenever word exhausted and we feel

1550
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:28,068
isolated is like yes you're supposed to

1551
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:31,609
feel tired you're supposed to feel

1552
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:34,219
isolated that's like how we get broken

1553
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:37,369
down you know so we have to resist that

1554
01:08:34,219 --> 01:08:39,759
by like lifting up at everybody else and

1555
01:08:37,368 --> 01:08:42,139
you know lifting up ourselves because

1556
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,520
you know like that's how it that's how

1557
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:50,839
we'll be able to get through this and

1558
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:51,830
and you know I I I expected to spend 35

1559
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:57,380
years in prison

1560
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:59,028
and so I I knew like I was going to

1561
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,190
spend that amount of time week

1562
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:03,799
you couldn't change that you couldn't I

1563
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:06,710
was like okay like I accept that I'm

1564
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:09,439
gonna be here for a very long time that

1565
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:11,118
didn't stop me from like continuing to

1566
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:13,129
be out there and continue to be involved

1567
01:09:11,118 --> 01:09:15,649
and continuing to write and continuing

1568
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:17,719
to speak out as difficult as that was

1569
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:20,089
and as time consuming as that was and as

1570
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:26,328
exhausting as that was especially from

1571
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:27,589
prison and you know even whenever there

1572
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,238
wasn't light at the end of the tunnel

1573
01:09:27,589 --> 01:09:30,799
even whenever it looked like this was

1574
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:33,799
never gonna happen like I was never

1575
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:35,359
gonna set foot like I was whenever we

1576
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:38,109
the last time though you know the first

1577
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,239
time that we met after after a few years

1578
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:45,829
the neither of us expected me to get out

1579
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:49,459
soon yeah I mean I mean like what like

1580
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:54,259
shortly after the last hope we talked to

1581
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:55,909
each other and you know like neither of

1582
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:57,920
us thought that this was gonna happen

1583
01:09:55,909 --> 01:09:59,780
like what we would be sitting here I

1584
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,039
mean I think we joked like you know we

1585
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,500
would do this interview which is why

1586
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,360
it's me on white which is why it's me

1587
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,579
and yon we like joked about that but

1588
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,679
like I didn't think was gonna happen I

1589
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:12,110
didn't think I was gonna be here but you

1590
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,309
know so like yeah like you maybe you

1591
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,839
can't see the light at the end of the

1592
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,280
tunnel but that doesn't mean it's not

1593
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,340
there doesn't mean the end of tunnel

1594
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,019
isn't there you know it just means you

1595
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,380
can't see it yeah so you just gotta keep

1596
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,380
going

1597
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:30,648
[Applause]

1598
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,840
so I know you've dealt with these

1599
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,960
feelings of depression and burnout

1600
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,640
occasionally and that must be really

1601
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,690
difficult as such a public person where

1602
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,050
like you know you feel like the

1603
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:48,429
spotlights on you and everyone watching

1604
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:50,770
do you have advice for people who are

1605
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:52,270
feeling depressed aren't out due to you

1606
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:57,430
know like feeling like nothing's getting

1607
01:10:52,270 --> 01:11:00,130
better or changing yeah it's okay like

1608
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:02,500
depression and anxiety are real they're

1609
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:05,550
normal lots of people get this stuff

1610
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:08,770
I mean I'm yeah as a public figure I'm

1611
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,840
openly willing to admit like hey you

1612
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:13,360
know I get III have to deal with

1613
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,120
depression I see a therapist on a fairly

1614
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,400
regular basis you know I have a

1615
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,320
psychiatrist you know I you know I take

1616
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,969
varying levels of medications on

1617
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,490
occasion depending on my mood and

1618
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:28,450
depending on what I've been through and

1619
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:30,820
where I'm at in my life and that's okay

1620
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:34,840
you can ask for that you can say hey I

1621
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:44,980
need help hey and we can help each other

1622
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:53,080
out you know you know and it's real and

1623
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:54,910
it's scary and you know like a lot of us

1624
01:11:53,080 --> 01:12:01,950
have these demons and a lot of us have

1625
01:11:54,910 --> 01:12:01,950
to fight with this and I hope that I

1626
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:09,730
hope that we can come to a point where

1627
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:12,940
most people are willing to accept that

1628
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:15,719
it's not weakness to like be depressed

1629
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,719
it's not

1630
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:26,840
it's not it's not a scientific it's just

1631
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:29,509
chemicals in your brain or just like oh

1632
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:32,140
well you're depressed now you know like

1633
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:35,630
you got this imbalance thing so like

1634
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:37,699
it's not and you know like you some you

1635
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:39,739
know and this is the part that I think a

1636
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:43,428
lot of people forget is like getting a

1637
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:45,489
depression can be completely not related

1638
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:47,659
to your situation in life you know

1639
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:49,459
things can be going really well but

1640
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:52,339
you're like oh my God my life is ending

1641
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:54,409
you know it doesn't make sense but like

1642
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:57,610
your best brain chemistry brain

1643
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:57,610
chemistry doesn't make sense sometimes

1644
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:05,090
so you've probably been the target of

1645
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:09,620
more online trolling and hatred than

1646
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:10,670
like 99.999% of people yeah how do you

1647
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:16,370
how do you deal with that

1648
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:19,820
ah why I don't read it you know and I

1649
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:21,980
have a policy I've had I've had a policy

1650
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:26,509
for several years of not reading about

1651
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:28,669
myself yeah and you know I've fallen and

1652
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:30,350
for that trap before you know and I did

1653
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:33,440
you know I did it recently where I just

1654
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:37,040
started I started I started to upset you

1655
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,750
know like I started to obsess over what

1656
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,909
people were saying and thinking and I'm

1657
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,050
just like yeah now I were like taking a

1658
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:45,349
step back from that I would say hey

1659
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:46,850
actually you know like I'm okay like

1660
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:50,390
that there's not a whole you know like

1661
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:51,739
I'm doing fine actually you know like I

1662
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:53,989
spent I started spending too much time

1663
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:55,968
on Twitter on my alts and I think that

1664
01:13:53,989 --> 01:14:00,909
was the problem is like as i started

1665
01:13:55,969 --> 01:14:04,969
using alts and you know and and i I

1666
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:06,830
started to get sucked in and then that

1667
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:08,449
started to start to show on my regular

1668
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:10,640
Twitter account which is much more

1669
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:11,928
thoughtful I mean I really think about

1670
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,969
their tweets that I'm about to do

1671
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:18,530
sometimes but I was thinking less and

1672
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:21,380
less about that and so you know it's

1673
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:24,170
been tough and I know Batman and I'm

1674
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,630
back to just you know like living life

1675
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:29,060
and doing normal stuff again so I'm not

1676
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,710
really I mean I I'm not obsessing on

1677
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:32,900
Twitter mm-hmm

1678
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:35,090
speaking of Twitter do you think there's

1679
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,849
a problem with the role of social media

1680
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:39,860
in politics yeah I see use and all that

1681
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:43,330
and actually yeah you know I think I

1682
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,330
think it goes back to algorithm this uh

1683
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:53,230
machine learning has picked up on the

1684
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:56,809
fact that we're now being

1685
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:58,519
hyperstimulated like these machine like

1686
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:01,190
the this machine learning is like

1687
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,530
finding that little spot in your the

1688
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:08,330
reptilian part of our brain to like

1689
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:10,130
encourage us to generate more more um to

1690
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:13,340
generate more content which then

1691
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:15,469
generates more content and so these

1692
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:17,989
algorithms are creating a feedback loop

1693
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:20,300
and so that feedback loop is like hey

1694
01:15:17,989 --> 01:15:23,120
let's make people you know you know what

1695
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,500
really gets people going on Twitter when

1696
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,390
they're angry and they're upset about

1697
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,830
something and something crazy and

1698
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:30,440
unexpected is happening

1699
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:34,280
so like now the algorithms are

1700
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:36,679
encouraging that and that's why we seem

1701
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,679
so much weird stuff happening as because

1702
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:45,040
you know these algorithms are honing in

1703
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:47,360
on this on this little this little meme

1704
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,239
generating you know weakness in our

1705
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:53,509
brain where you know now the memes

1706
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:56,179
spread you know and it is it is just

1707
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:57,980
like it is just like DNA like these this

1708
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,590
information I I get the sense is

1709
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:03,110
actually trying to you know like in a

1710
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:05,060
sense without like cause or direction

1711
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:07,700
but it's you know it's were the vehicles

1712
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:10,489
of reproduction for information and like

1713
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,900
Twitter is X and Facebook and these

1714
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:15,320
social media algorithms are exploiting

1715
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,700
that and yeah so we see all these social

1716
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,349
effects from that but they're actually

1717
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:21,050
stemming from this thing that's

1718
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:22,489
happening to our brains like what do you

1719
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:24,140
think can be done about that because it

1720
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:25,580
seems like if that keeps going you know

1721
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,590
people just get more and more extreme

1722
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,360
about their views yeah and we have swing

1723
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:32,180
you stop I mean it's just as simple as

1724
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,620
that like we need to like out I mean

1725
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,390
it's not even just logout because like

1726
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,610
we still need these tools to like

1727
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,890
communicate but like maybe we should

1728
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:42,799
stop picking and choosing what people

1729
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,750
see you know like algorithmically you

1730
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,980
know

1731
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,510
because what like what's happening is

1732
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:50,239
we're getting stuck in these bubbles and

1733
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:53,030
I'm that feeling sometimes to where I

1734
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:55,909
just I have to like leave and exit from

1735
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:57,610
this bubble this bubble universe that

1736
01:16:55,909 --> 01:17:02,330
I'm a part of like I can't

1737
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:05,000
exit that sometimes but I something so I

1738
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:10,760
have to like look outside of it and it's

1739
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:16,100
really you know it's really tough but we

1740
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:17,210
can do that and and reading books helps

1741
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:24,440
me certainly

1742
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:27,110
reading reading about like other things

1743
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:29,210
that are going on that I'm not familiar

1744
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:32,570
with so things that I don't necessarily

1745
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:34,190
have an interest in I actually find that

1746
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:36,440
I do have an interest in it I just

1747
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:40,339
didn't know I did so exposing myself to

1748
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:45,650
new ideas to new ways of thinking and

1749
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:47,780
new new cultures and new social norms

1750
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:50,509
is is something that's been very

1751
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:53,300
profound for me and I think allows you

1752
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:55,070
to step outside of that outside of that

1753
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,449
bubble because all these algorithm is

1754
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,449
just gonna find the things that you

1755
01:17:56,449 --> 01:18:04,339
really are already into and then like

1756
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:08,030
get you wound up and you know it happens

1757
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:10,250
to everyone even me are there any books

1758
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:16,580
or sources of information you would

1759
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:21,040
recommend to this audience Wow the long

1760
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:21,040
list may be just a couple I

1761
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:27,610
yeah I have like a whole bookshelf and I

1762
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:30,160
always worry especially whenever I like

1763
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:31,809
you know because like I've learned

1764
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,360
things from books that I don't

1765
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:38,670
necessarily endorse and I think that's

1766
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:42,370
something that I keep tight in

1767
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:44,230
internally is that even though I might

1768
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:46,210
not endorse or agree with a book I

1769
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,419
learned I took I had to take away from

1770
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,160
that

1771
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:54,850
so I read stuff that I don't necessarily

1772
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:56,950
agree with and and I think that's how

1773
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:59,590
you become exposed to different ideas

1774
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:02,500
and how you generate an actual more

1775
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:05,290
nuanced view and opinion of the world is

1776
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:07,150
by you know like I guess the

1777
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:11,200
recommendation is not a specific book

1778
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:14,259
it's find information that you don't

1779
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,150
know find opinions that you don't

1780
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:19,210
necessarily agree with and learn about

1781
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:21,879
them learn about what they are and you

1782
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:23,530
can understand your position better and

1783
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,620
your thoughts better and where you've

1784
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:33,370
sittin in society better and maybe you

1785
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:35,590
do agree with something so yeah cool how

1786
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:37,030
do you find like how do you search out

1787
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:41,890
opinions that you're you don't

1788
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:43,210
necessarily agree with um like where do

1789
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:51,250
you go for that information

1790
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:53,620
I go to there's no source that's

1791
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,900
credible no individual source so you

1792
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:58,120
have to like and you know and I'm gonna

1793
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:01,059
put my intelligence analyst hat on cuz

1794
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:04,930
this is how I work you know it's how I

1795
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:07,150
did my job back in back then is you

1796
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:09,790
corroborate lots of different sources

1797
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:14,230
and they if there have varying degrees

1798
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:16,210
of veracity and you can like categorize

1799
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:19,919
the veracity of those and so you have to

1800
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:24,640
like an aspect of critical thinking is

1801
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:27,180
understanding that your secondary

1802
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:29,770
sources are going through a filter you

1803
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,240
know you're being told about something

1804
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:33,610
you know a news article is telling you

1805
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:36,219
about something but and it's not that

1806
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:37,170
you know and it might sound unbiased but

1807
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,120
like

1808
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:41,780
how they frame it and what they're

1809
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:45,929
withholding and what these things mean

1810
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:49,050
is is is it very important to keep in

1811
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:50,610
mind so in order to get if you don't

1812
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:56,730
have access to say a primary source

1813
01:20:50,610 --> 01:21:01,320
which and I have the privilege of access

1814
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:03,780
to this kind of thing I get to if not

1815
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,699
everybody does but if something's going

1816
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:07,739
on and I want to know something about

1817
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:10,049
what hey what's up with this I can just

1818
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:11,459
ask somebody I can just email somebody

1819
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:15,360
and be like hey what's the story with

1820
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,949
this that's the most valuable way that

1821
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,389
you can learn about something but that's

1822
01:21:16,949 --> 01:21:23,879
not accessible to everyone

1823
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:25,170
so you but you can file for requests

1824
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,960
especially if it involves like

1825
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:31,230
government stuff or scandals and things

1826
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:33,840
like that those are very effective I've

1827
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:37,160
done hundreds of FOIA requests myself

1828
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:40,219
not all of them have been fruitful but

1829
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:43,260
I've learned something from them also

1830
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:45,330
seeking out primary sources as I think

1831
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,920
the ultimate thing that you can do and

1832
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:49,559
it's the ultimate thing than I do is I

1833
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,270
find the email like I find that email

1834
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,620
that everybody is like mad about and I'm

1835
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:54,630
like okay what does it say oh it's

1836
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:56,160
actually not that bad you know like it's

1837
01:21:54,630 --> 01:22:01,380
being blown out of context or whatever

1838
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:04,650
but like actually seeing a primary

1839
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:07,260
source is where I try to find

1840
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:10,049
information LexisNexis is a good

1841
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:13,890
resource as well got it so we're gonna

1842
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:17,520
open up the floor for a Q&A right about

1843
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:20,070
now we would like to ask that if you are

1844
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:24,780
part of an underrepresented group at

1845
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:27,030
hope you can go first or you know if you

1846
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,050
don't usually speak up at these na

1847
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,880
sessions I know it can be intimidating

1848
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:34,010
when there's a lot of people in line

1849
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:43,310
yeah yeah so trans women people of color

1850
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:43,310
trans people etc nan you non-us people

1851
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:48,570
yeah hi Chelsea just wanna first off

1852
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:50,940
just I just want to say thank you for

1853
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:52,769
being here and thank you for

1854
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:54,919
you know everything you've done all the

1855
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:59,449
sacrifice you've gone through and

1856
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:03,480
especially thanks for your Senate

1857
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:08,370
primary campaign and the platform that

1858
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:11,099
you put forward as a member of the LGBTQ

1859
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:12,780
community myself and you know someone

1860
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,550
who shares your worldview it would have

1861
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:17,219
been great it would be great to see your

1862
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,880
platform in my opinion great to see your

1863
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:20,400
platform

1864
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:24,750
you know come come to pass in this

1865
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:26,009
country and in the midst of everything

1866
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,840
going on right now I'm actually

1867
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:29,610
encouraged and optimistic because

1868
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,650
they're right here in New York City we

1869
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:39,949
do have a candidate who did win her

1870
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:39,949
primary Alexandria Courtis Cortez right

1871
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:45,150
and you know her platform shared a lot

1872
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:49,889
of same things your platform did about

1873
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:53,969
abolition of ice b14 it prison prison

1874
01:23:49,890 --> 01:24:00,330
reform and incarcerate for a form of

1875
01:23:53,969 --> 01:24:02,550
prisons way more than that I just would

1876
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:07,080
love to hear your comments on you know

1877
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:09,210
her her victory over Joe Crowley and and

1878
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:17,940
and your thoughts on the the democratic

1879
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:20,430
socialist movement mm-hmm I mean I'm I'm

1880
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:22,440
encouraged by what I see from some parts

1881
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:25,770
of DSA but I think that it's you know

1882
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:28,469
like DSA has been going through you know

1883
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:31,410
like a rejuvenation phase and so there's

1884
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:35,250
a lot of growing pains with that and I'd

1885
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:37,620
like I'd like to see where you know DSA

1886
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,630
in particular lands on some of these

1887
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:44,219
things because I don't think that's been

1888
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:45,600
worked out yet so yeah I'm definitely

1889
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:47,730
paying attention to the things that are

1890
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,530
going on with you know people who are

1891
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:50,910
whether or not they're officially DSA or

1892
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:53,280
whether or not they're aligned with DSA

1893
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:58,519
or just associated with but I'm very

1894
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:58,519
encouraged great thanks thank you

1895
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:07,230
hello hey so I have a question regarding

1896
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,030
so a lot of developing countries or even

1897
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:11,940
communities here in the US where

1898
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,710
resources are limited or restricted a

1899
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:16,320
lot of people are just happy to have a

1900
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:18,809
platform to be able to create or to

1901
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,308
innovate in the beginning of this talk

1902
01:25:18,809 --> 01:25:22,380
you talked about how we should perhaps

1903
01:25:20,309 --> 01:25:24,329
police ourselves in what we work on

1904
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,449
create or develop yeah

1905
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:32,219
do you believe maybe or this is actually

1906
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:32,999
my question should we perhaps choose who

1907
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:35,130
do we work for

1908
01:25:32,999 --> 01:25:36,869
whose poor question may be who's giving

1909
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:40,349
us the platform or the resources rather

1910
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:42,839
than not create at all absolutely I mean

1911
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:46,019
that that is exactly what I'm saying and

1912
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:48,389
and in many respects I I've made this

1913
01:25:46,019 --> 01:25:54,599
mistake I've worked for I worked for a

1914
01:25:48,389 --> 01:25:55,499
startup company that was unscrupulous to

1915
01:25:54,599 --> 01:25:58,829
say the least

1916
01:25:55,499 --> 01:26:03,119
I mean I I've written software at

1917
01:25:58,829 --> 01:26:07,018
various stages in my life that I regret

1918
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:09,119
writing you know because it it was done

1919
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:13,079
without it was done with not necessarily

1920
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:15,089
enough a nefarious intent but it was

1921
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:16,768
done kind of carelessly it was like okay

1922
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:19,949
I'm gonna meet this criteria I'm gonna

1923
01:26:16,769 --> 01:26:23,429
make this system do exactly what the

1924
01:26:19,949 --> 01:26:25,469
boss says it's gonna do and and you know

1925
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:27,780
I was young and I was in it I was an

1926
01:26:25,469 --> 01:26:29,789
intern back then so I weren't used to

1927
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:33,690
work at this photo hosting company way

1928
01:26:29,789 --> 01:26:35,789
back when and it it's no longer a thing

1929
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:37,739
so it was definitely not it was

1930
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:40,768
definitely not fit Flickr Instagram it

1931
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:43,768
did not make it did not survive but uh I

1932
01:26:40,769 --> 01:26:45,300
learned a lot about you know how you do

1933
01:26:43,769 --> 01:26:48,150
have to pick your own you know you if

1934
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:50,460
you can and I understand the difficulty

1935
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:52,768
with this you know is that in the

1936
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:55,170
society we're in like you you've got to

1937
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:59,760
pay the bills you've got to get bread on

1938
01:26:55,170 --> 01:27:02,190
the table and but I think that if you do

1939
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,940
have the choice and the choice that you

1940
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:09,239
make is very important and is definitely

1941
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:10,949
a reflection of it you know like it

1942
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:11,669
should be a reflection of the values you

1943
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:14,460
have

1944
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:16,710
and and you know if and if something

1945
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:18,000
doesn't exist and consider the

1946
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:19,770
possibility that you might be able to

1947
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,570
create something new you might be able

1948
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:23,130
to create something different maybe you

1949
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:25,380
had there's other people that you're

1950
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:27,630
around and you think the same way and

1951
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:31,230
you have like a new ID and a new concept

1952
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:32,910
that's not necessarily one of the ones

1953
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:34,709
that exists you know like you know like

1954
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:36,059
that like you know if you're want to get

1955
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:40,230
into cryptography like do you need to

1956
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:42,450
work for the NSA not necessarily if you

1957
01:27:40,230 --> 01:27:43,620
want to work on if you want to work on

1958
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:46,500
drones you don't have to necessarily

1959
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:49,800
work for Boeing or Lockheed Martin you

1960
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:54,350
know like choosing when you can is I

1961
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,350
think very important thank you thank you

1962
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,830
especially at hope let's let's be honest

1963
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:06,330
like there's a lot of people who are

1964
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:08,610
American mercenaries in this room hi my

1965
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:10,200
real question is what about gender

1966
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:12,570
discrimination where people know who you

1967
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,769
are don't know who you are and if I see

1968
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:15,420
on this she has this call you Elizabeth

1969
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:20,670
or something not to bring attention to

1970
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:22,650
you well what's that well I see others

1971
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,090
see I'm not going to announce to the

1972
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:26,639
world oh I'm talking about just call you

1973
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:29,220
Elizabeth oh yeah like I yeah like if

1974
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,910
when I'm getting coffee I'm Liz all

1975
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,500
right sorry

1976
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,269
no the question is what about gender

1977
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,380
discrimination when people know who you

1978
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,540
are or where they don't know who you are

1979
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:39,420
or just when you look out there and see

1980
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:44,160
it you've seen things yeah and so like

1981
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:49,500
yeah definitely I had a privilege drop

1982
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:52,080
so I went from having white male

1983
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,940
privilege to having like white trans

1984
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,620
woman privilege which is a totally

1985
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:59,460
different game it's a totally different

1986
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:03,059
environment and that's really hard to

1987
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:03,870
deal with because I'm not used to it all

1988
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,330
the time

1989
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:09,210
and I shouldn't have to deal with that

1990
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:12,140
obviously but it's a real phenomenon and

1991
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:14,670
it's something that I've experienced I

1992
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:18,390
get I mean I certainly whenever I'm in

1993
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:19,800
the middle of I'm biggest offender is

1994
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:22,470
like whenever I go to like Micro Center

1995
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,600
and I'm like walking or down the store

1996
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,570
and like you know people like people

1997
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,320
want it like

1998
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:32,080
you know white middle-class males come

1999
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:34,179
up to me like hey you know like they're

2000
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:37,630
telling me stuff about technology and

2001
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:40,110
I'm like like I know what I'm doing I

2002
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:41,890
know what I'm looking for

2003
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:43,839
actually that you know what you're

2004
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:46,440
saying is not what I'm looking for at

2005
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:49,660
all you know like what you know

2006
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:53,410
same with the hardware store like I I do

2007
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:55,420
like I know I know tools I worked in a

2008
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:57,220
wood shop for three and a half years I

2009
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:59,200
kind of know my stuff whenever it comes

2010
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:00,460
to like woodworking and tools and

2011
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,040
working with this kind of thing and

2012
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:06,820
being explained thing this is like the

2013
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:15,400
most annoying thing that I've had to

2014
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:17,410
deal with you don't and you know like

2015
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,519
like when I was in the room like you

2016
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:19,990
know like there were just happily a

2017
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,310
pallet jack in there I started playing

2018
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:23,019
with the pallet jack and somebody was

2019
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:24,460
like somebody comments and was like hey

2020
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,890
you know how to use a pallet jack and

2021
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:30,340
I'm like yeah I use one for years you

2022
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:33,010
know so yeah like I think I think it's

2023
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:34,750
you know like mansplaining as you know

2024
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,490
sometimes called but it's it's not just

2025
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:38,530
that you know like I think there's an

2026
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:41,230
assumption and it doesn't just come from

2027
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:45,219
from you know whites as men I think it

2028
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:48,940
comes from broader swath of society that

2029
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:50,680
kind of expects you know unless you know

2030
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:52,780
precisely who I am and you know my

2031
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:54,970
background then you're gonna make

2032
01:30:52,780 --> 01:31:00,929
assumptions based on the way I look and

2033
01:30:54,970 --> 01:31:00,930
I don't think that's right hi hi

2034
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:06,379
thank you so much for your courage and

2035
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:08,330
your heroism thank you my question is

2036
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:09,740
about what was the nature of the

2037
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:11,360
communication that the Obama

2038
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:13,580
administration had with you before your

2039
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,040
release because it seems like that

2040
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:18,140
administration statistically was kind of

2041
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:20,030
the most vicious one of any presidency

2042
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,890
towards whistleblowers and I'm just

2043
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:23,929
wondering what how that happened what if

2044
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:29,510
you have a perspective on that oh yeah

2045
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:31,100
so this is a really complicated one we

2046
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:34,070
didn't know anything

2047
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:39,580
we just heard stuff that's pretty much

2048
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:46,309
how that went down we heard rumors

2049
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:51,710
offline unconfirmed months before that

2050
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:53,540
it was being considered but yeah like it

2051
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:56,390
was a shot in the dark we did we had no

2052
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:58,190
idea like where the coin was going to go

2053
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:59,630
down or like which which side of the

2054
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:03,110
coin was it was going to like land on

2055
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:05,630
and I don't I don't think the

2056
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:07,730
administration had made a decision until

2057
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:12,730
the day they decided to be perfectly

2058
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:14,959
honest so I I

2059
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:17,030
there was no like official

2060
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,590
communications but certainly we were

2061
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:20,150
paying attention we were trying to read

2062
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:23,540
the tea leaves as to what they they were

2063
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:24,860
doing what was going on at the time but

2064
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,780
yeah but I don't know what to use this

2065
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:29,780
opportunity to be like I'm very thankful

2066
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,940
that this happened you know III yes the

2067
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:34,969
administration was really really really

2068
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:38,299
bad on journal on press freedom on

2069
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:42,080
journalists on sources consistently bad

2070
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:46,820
and and on so many things you know drone

2071
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:53,090
strikes the Iraq war continuing you know

2072
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:56,360
Yemen Libya etc and I think that I'm not

2073
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:59,060
giving them a free pass on that but you

2074
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,370
know I I do appreciate getting released

2075
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:07,430
out of prison it's some consolation at

2076
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:14,070
least so Thanks

2077
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:16,350
thank you oh hi super interesting to

2078
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:18,929
hear you as a person more than just

2079
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:21,150
leaking eight years ago and sort of

2080
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,720
trying to rebuild yourself you know

2081
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:24,540
post-prison

2082
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:26,850
I'm curious what you like I want your

2083
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:29,100
legacy or like history to look like what

2084
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:30,270
you are trying to build towards so when

2085
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,710
history looks back I mean you have a

2086
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:34,830
Wikipedia page right

2087
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:37,680
yeah it's changings constantly - I have

2088
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:40,500
noticed that I went from just I went

2089
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:44,030
from a convicted leaker - to a

2090
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:46,490
whistleblower and convicted leaker to

2091
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:49,860
politician and activists and

2092
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:50,580
whistleblower so like it's I'm and I'm

2093
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,740
not done yet

2094
01:33:50,580 --> 01:34:03,870
trust me I got plenty of stuff down the

2095
01:33:52,740 --> 01:34:05,639
line I don't really care about my legacy

2096
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:07,950
in terms of like what history writes

2097
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,600
because history is gonna get written by

2098
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:11,790
somebody else you know and get

2099
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,050
reinterpreted by somebody else 50s that

2100
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:14,700
100 years from now

2101
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,230
I actually often think about this

2102
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:18,179
whenever we like look look back at

2103
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:19,860
history and you know like the more that

2104
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,480
we learn about a particular period like

2105
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,769
we find that actually we just had Serio

2106
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,169
types of the spate of this different

2107
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:27,570
particular time frame before and like

2108
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:30,120
actually like the normal things were

2109
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:33,630
going on and you know like the and stuff

2110
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:35,880
and I think that that might happen with

2111
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:38,490
history is that it tends you know

2112
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:40,140
there's a lot of inaccurate things in my

2113
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:44,340
Wikipedia page and on the history about

2114
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:46,380
this case that you know like I don't I

2115
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,150
know that they're wrong but I mean I'm

2116
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:51,030
not gonna fight it or anything like that

2117
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:56,639
I'm like I'm not so focused on it that

2118
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:58,490
I'm gonna like try to correct it I'm you

2119
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:01,200
know I'm just getting three years old

2120
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:05,790
I'm about to turn 31 and maybe in a few

2121
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:07,019
maybe in a few minutes and I'm just

2122
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:10,440
getting started I just started doing

2123
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:14,190
stuff again and you know like I I hope

2124
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:17,309
that my legacy is is one of doing work

2125
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:18,150
for 30 you know four years and not one

2126
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:20,550
of

2127
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:21,870
you know the one thing that I don't want

2128
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:24,690
to be the I don't want to be a one-hit

2129
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:28,740
wonder I want to be the like you know

2130
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:32,160
the like legend I guess I'd be kind of

2131
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:35,040
cool to be like the popstar type like

2132
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:42,000
like you know I like less you know house

2133
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:44,490
of pain and more Madonna I guess I just

2134
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,410
just want to acknowledge you on behalf

2135

think the first question I asked and and

2152
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:39,059
my other my question is like the I mean

2153
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:40,950
you said you needed you know if someone

2154
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:47,340
hiring the etherion foundation is hiring

2155
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:50,160
and if you said the Barrett I'm sure

2156
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:53,090
that I have opinions on blockchain well

2157
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,090

2158

there there are really good projects

2159
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:04,360
that have a lot of integrity that would

2160
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:06,470
benefit from your sis admin skills I

2161
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,450
mean I have opinions on blockchain

2162
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:17,620
that's all I'll say cool

2163
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:21,320
well thanks hey when you were in prison

2164
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:23,120
receiving letters from people did you

2165
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,860
like to hear about goings-on in the free

2166
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,210
world or that was that would that

2167
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:28,820
amplify your oppression would you only

2168
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:30,260
hear for like a strangers day or is that

2169
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:32,870
little creepy dude you have any words of

2170
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:37,090
advice for aspiring writers of letters

2171
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:37,090
to prisoners to try to uplift them

2172
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:47,540
there's no format there is no correct

2173
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:48,889
way to write a letter just write some

2174
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:56,840
people would just tell me how their day

2175
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:58,580
was and I liked that I liked that it

2176
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,010
doesn't have to be special it doesn't

2177
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:02,930
have a job like I just whenever I was

2178
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:04,250
getting letters in prison I just liked

2179
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:08,270
the fact that people were even writing

2180
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:09,830
to me so I mean I got pictures some

2181
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:11,540
people just do it old stuff which i

2182
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:13,250
thought was cool I mean there's one

2183
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:15,530
person there was one person particular

2184
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:20,330
in particular out in Michigan who would

2185
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:25,460
just send me doodles and I just I one

2186
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:28,070
time just sent her doodles back yeah

2187
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:31,220
like that was that was like it can't be

2188
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:34,820
whatever it's just it's not about the

2189
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:37,340
content of the letter it's about the the

2190
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:43,000
connection that you're establishing hey

2191
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:48,650
you're not forgotten you're loved you're

2192
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:53,570
appreciated you have people out here who

2193
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:57,139
value you you have inherent value and

2194
01:38:53,570 --> 01:39:00,980
just sending something it doesn't have

2195
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:04,370
to be anything special just maybe it can

2196
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:06,799
just be and I've gotten one sentence

2197
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:07,519
letters before and those are fine too

2198
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,090
like

2199
01:39:07,519 --> 01:39:12,619
Hey thinking about you period I mean

2200
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:15,860
obviously we're in the age of text

2201
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:19,429
messaging and you know signal so it's

2202
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:24,079
kind of that in that style I guess but

2203
01:39:19,429 --> 01:39:26,090
yeah thank you hi my I'm not going to

2204
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,880
have a deep question I am a political

2205
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:31,300
activist oh thank you

2206
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,980
and I've been trying to reach you before

2207
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:37,070
all this talk that you're doing in the

2208
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:40,339
last year and I'm too tired to go to

2209
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:43,340
three hours of of trying to get hold of

2210
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:46,519
your people okay now we are a bubble

2211
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:48,530
apart how do I get to our with you to

2212
01:39:46,519 --> 01:39:50,989
talk about project and thing like that

2213
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:54,530
what is the way to get hold of your

2214
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:56,030
people so there is no middleware people

2215
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:59,389
who will be saying that that guy is

2216
01:39:56,030 --> 01:40:01,340
crazy this is this and that yeah that is

2217
01:39:59,389 --> 01:40:06,499
that is uh there is a common dilemma

2218
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:11,360
with public figures that I must admit if

2219
01:40:06,499 --> 01:40:14,630
you can find yeah it's Janice here yeah

2220

like find this person and okay you know

2221
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:20,239
like they're like I have a point of

2222
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:23,150
contact in this room that will okay look

2223
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:25,339
for them yeah so if you can I can't see

2224
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:28,039

2225

and I will get back to you like with

2226
01:40:28,039 --> 01:40:32,300
whatever you want to talk about because

2227
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:36,320
yeah it's it's really difficult to reach

2228
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:40,119
me it's always been that way and and

2229
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:43,099
it's kind of I'm not happy about it but

2230
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:45,259
when you get as much requests as me like

2231
01:40:43,099 --> 01:40:52,369
it has to be otherwise I'm spending all

2232
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:53,749
day going through requests hey hi I do

2233
01:40:52,369 --> 01:40:56,239
have a question for you I want to

2234
01:40:53,749 --> 01:41:00,679
preface it by saying that I'm the five

2235
01:40:56,239 --> 01:41:03,919
o'clock speaker oh I am I am gonna be

2236
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:07,429
talking quite a bit about you so awesome

2237
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:10,369
and considerably less reverentially than

2238
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:15,710
you've been experiencing for the past

2239
01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:18,499
couple hours so in in general fairness I

2240
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:21,490
hope you'll come to my talk and tell me

2241
01:41:18,499 --> 01:41:24,349
everything that I'm getting wrong

2242
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:27,820
just just trying to be fair about it my

2243
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:33,950
question to you is regarding mr. Assange

2244
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:39,460
okay in reviewing let's just say your

2245
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:42,679
case file to prepare for my talk in part

2246
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:44,360
and interviewing some people who have

2247
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:48,010
considerably more knowledge about your

2248
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:53,719
case than I do it began to appear to me

2249
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:57,430
that either on purpose or by accident

2250
01:41:53,720 --> 01:42:00,380
you gave the US government the means to

2251
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:03,590
indict mr. Assange that there is now an

2252
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:06,830
arrest warrant out for mr. Assange based

2253
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:09,770
in part on either what you admitted or

2254
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:12,559
volunteered or whatever the correct word

2255
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:17,000
is so would you care to comment on that

2256
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,920
rumor or expand on it or whatever no I

2257
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:26,270
don't know what you're talking about

2258
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:27,770
first off but second off I I don't

2259
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:30,950
really have the ability unfortunately

2260
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:33,740
like the stuff that happened in 2010 the

2261
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:37,849
case as you know is statute of

2262
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:39,889
limitations is up not for like like if I

2263
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:42,410
really camping then I can get charged

2264
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:44,810
for that so if I'm under a nondisclosure

2265
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:46,820
agreement about the case file so the

2266
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:48,080
there was closed hearings I can't talk

2267
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:48,799
about what was in those hearings and I

2268
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:51,019
won't

2269
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,570
I'm not going to violate those you know

2270
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,950
I don't want to get arrested again so it

2271
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:59,960
had nothing to do with your sentence

2272
01:42:54,950 --> 01:43:02,330
being commuted you can't talk about it

2273
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:03,920
can we I'd like to move on from this

2274
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:06,080
yeah like you're speaking of five I

2275
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:09,020
don't and maybe it can open a discussion

2276
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:11,450
then I don't know in that regard like no

2277
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:18,230
like the the commutation was completely

2278
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:20,660
unrelated to anything like that III 100%

2279
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:27,740
of denied ah yeah that's that's an easy

2280
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:31,130
one I would love to hear you have plans

2281
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:32,750
or thoughts or what capacity you want to

2282
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:33,320
like further pursue cryptography or the

2283
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,940
ring LW

2284
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:38,660
stuff that you're reading about which is

2285
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:46,129
really exciting yeah I I do I have a lot

2286
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:48,980
of comments on that I I've I work a lot

2287
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:51,080
with cryptography now I really care

2288
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:53,299
about cryptography I'm really concerned

2289
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,830
about want about quantum computing in

2290
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,960
regards to that which is why I was

2291
01:43:54,830 --> 01:44:03,680
interested in post quantum cryptography

2292
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:08,600
I think that y'all need to pay more

2293
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:14,060
attention to to like quantum computing

2294
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:18,100
in regards to RSA I'm not trying to like

2295
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:20,900
explain that but like please take

2296
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:26,690
quantum computing more seriously right

2297
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:30,740
now because RSA is vulnerable and we

2298
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:32,089
need a replacement and so for at least

2299
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:33,700
for the public key archetype

2300
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:42,290
you know for public key infrastructure

2301
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:44,599
and I will be I do plan on doing work in

2302
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:46,070
this regard that's one of the reason I

2303
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:48,140
mean one of the reasons why I Ryan Wyatt

2304
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:51,230
why I write and rust is because

2305
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:53,300
cryptography works very well in a rust

2306
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:55,610
environment because it's memory you know

2307
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:57,530
because it's memory safe and it's it's

2308
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:59,269
it's very you know it's as a low-level

2309
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:00,650
programming language it's very efficient

2310
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:02,600
and you can put it on to hardware

2311
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:04,790
devices you can put actually put

2312
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:06,860
binaries and you know flash them down

2313
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:12,410
you know devices and make hardware

2314
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:15,410
encryption possible I think that I'm

2315
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:19,700
gonna start I'm you know I'm gonna start

2316
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:24,260
writing implementations of cryptography

2317
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:25,550
and to varying degrees and and gaining

2318
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,100
that knowledge and experience of doing

2319
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:30,200
the read of like the applications so I'm

2320
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:34,040
more interested in applied cryptography

2321
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:37,460
and the analysis of that cryptography

2322
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:39,530
than I am in the actual well although I

2323
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:41,240
love math you know I love playing around

2324
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:43,250
those symbols like actually implementing

2325
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:46,250
something is I think that something that

2326
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:50,240
is necessary and we need to

2327
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:53,480
do right now and yeah so we'll take one

2328
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:54,710
more question I think I think that's all

2329
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,250
we got time for oh my god the pressure

2330
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:58,790
is on

2331
01:45:55,250 --> 01:46:01,370
yeah sorry hang on so I wanted to circle

2332
01:45:58,790 --> 01:46:03,280
back on ethics and technology yes

2333
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:07,340
interaction designer and researcher I

2334
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:09,410
look at Neil postman's six questions for

2335
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:12,140
the analysis of you know potential

2336
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:14,059
technologies and looking at the you know

2337
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:15,950
unintended consequences and shifts of

2338
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:17,660
power and I was curious if you had a

2339
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:19,280
similar framework or set of questions

2340
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:25,010
that you like to use when you're

2341
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:31,519
evaluating a technology I'm trying to

2342
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:33,920
develop this right now you know like

2343
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:35,270
like initially it's a lot of gut

2344
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,210
instincts and sort of like an

2345
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:41,660
understanding of very complex systems

2346
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:46,130
and how you know you can maybe predict

2347
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:48,410
some of the like how like how a fractal

2348
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:52,460
feedback loop environment will operate

2349
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:54,950
but I'm trying to write down like the

2350
01:46:52,460 --> 01:47:00,140
questions that you should go through and

2351
01:46:54,950 --> 01:47:03,260
ask for different systems I would love

2352
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:06,260
to be able to consult people and tell

2353
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:08,900
people like what things you should be

2354
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:14,000
looking for what the warning signs are

2355
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:16,910
what and it's less about the specifics

2356
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,970
and more about developing a general

2357
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:21,889
method in the same sense that there's

2358
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:27,020
that you know doctors gonna have like an

2359
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:29,300
ethical like you know method that they

2360
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:32,510
go through and they do an analysis of

2361
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:37,610
ethical situations and complex moral

2362
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:40,010
dilemmas we don't have that yet and I

2363
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:42,860
think that we should be writing this

2364
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:44,810
down I have come up with some proposals

2365
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:47,690
behind the scenes but they're not ready

2366
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:52,160
for publication thank you so much thank

2367
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:53,990
you and that's all the time we have Hey

2368
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:56,500
thank you thank you all for coming

2369
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:56,500
thanks Chelsea

2370
01:47:56,630 --> 01:48:01,370
I'm gonna be in the hardware hackers

2371
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:09,350
lounge area so see ya

2372
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:09,349
[Applause]
