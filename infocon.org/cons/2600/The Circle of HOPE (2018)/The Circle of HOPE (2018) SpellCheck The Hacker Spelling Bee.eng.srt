00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,560
this is an event that I invented so

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,059
there are no expectations

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,050
you have no idea this isn't going

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,120
perfectly so just for a little bit of

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,800
context Who I am and why this is

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,509
happening to you

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,120
my name is Brianne Hughes I'm a

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,150
technical editor for Bishop Fox security

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,100
consulting firm I have a master's in

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,740
linguistics I do a lot of weird things I

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,490
like words a lot and my day-to-day life

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,679
is editing technical reports and so that

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,780
sort of merged into me making a style

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,640
guide which is available for you so

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,930
first thing is words I do talks about

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,150
words they're pretty fun and I've I've

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,880
lost a lot of spelling bees

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,430
I lost a spelling bee in middle school

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,890
on camouflage I lost it in college on

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,150
dilapidated but I lived in Portland

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,970
Oregon for eight years and they had

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,710
adult spelling bees and so for the first

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,260
time in my life I got to hold a giant

35
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,860
chick has anyone gotten to hold a giant

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,509
check it's worth doing if you can find a

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,229
way to do it go for it

38
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:04,310
so I wanted this bee I also won at a

39
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,690
couple of other bees and so I have a

40
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,580
good time with words and I thought this

41
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,199
would be a fun thing it's obviously a

42
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,800
stressful situation for spellers but

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,269
it's also it's good cathartic moment the

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,840
the word side of this wouldn't make any

45
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,460
sense without the hacker tech side so as

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,790
I mentioned before I made this

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,819
cybersecurity style guide this is what

48
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,030
it looks like right now it's 103 pages

49
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:31,040
it's mostly the actual content of how to

50
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,260
write terms and which terms to choose

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
for different scenarios the beginning

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,319
part tells you how to use it

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,710
the end part gives you some external

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,530
resources we actually just created a

55
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,360
searchable browser version of this which

56
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,850
you can go to at cybersecurity style

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,850
guide com it's very new this is a sort

58
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,230
of a soft launch so you may it may be a

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,620
little slow for the search but you can

60
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,010
also download the PDF of version 1.1

61
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,530
it's pretty great I made it because I

62
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,700
needed it as a technical editor and it's

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,510
turned out that a lot of other people

64
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,798
could use it too

65
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:09,349
so I recommend checking it out the main

66
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,569
reason why I advocate for people to

67
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,700
check out this guide is because life is

68
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,708
an open book test there's no reason why

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,480
you have to know the answers and there's

70
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,909
almost no reason why you would remember

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,310
that website is together but web pages

72
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,989
apart and then web form is doing

73
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,750
something and then web comics and I

74
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,659
don't know so you look at a style guide

75
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,150
and you don't have to keep looking this

76
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,370
up every single time and with all the

77
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,980
camelcase and random capitalizations and

78
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,510
tools and products and companies this is

79
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,670
just trying to make your life easier as

80
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,349
a writer everyone needs an editor and I

81
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,720
can't be all of your editors but you can

82
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,159
check out this thing so life is an open

83
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,940
book test check out the cybersecurity

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,578
style guide the caveat to this lovely

85
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:58,879
phrase is not tonight tonight is a

86
00:03:52,579 --> 00:04:00,980
closed book test so please please don't

87
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,480
cheat I'm not sure exactly how you would

88
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,190
effectively cheat in this forum but you

89
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,679
just have your wits your your own

90
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:17,440
knowledge hmm perfect

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,070
so this spelling bee has some rules

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,570
unfortunately those spellers are on

93
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,639
stage so they cannot see this very well

94
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,080
but I will say everything out loud it's

95
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,940
just that this is sort of summarizing

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,409
the important parts so that the audience

97
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,070
knows that I'm not just making up rules

98
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,979
as I go along and there is an asterisk

99
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,500
to that statement okay so the first

100
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:38,120
thing to expect in SB is that the

101
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,710
official spelling of each term for the

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,720
bee comes from the most recent version

103
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,880
of the Bishop Fox cybersecurity style

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,919
guide the terms in the bee may have

105
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,780
variant Spelling's or homophones in the

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,698
wide world but if it's not the one from

107
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,799
the guide it's considered incorrect for

108
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,199
this bee I know that a lot of people

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,349
only interact with tool names in the

110
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,880
context of like terminal but in this

111
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:01,820
case we're going off of their their

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,800
legal names the strange way they tend to

113
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,900
capitalize things not in their logo

114
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,750
sometimes people stylize is you know all

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,460
lowercase but the actual sort of way

116
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,789
they are written in formal technical

117
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,669
reports so that's what they're coming

118
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,039
from you can take it up with me but I am

119
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,160
the host announcer judge jury and

120
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,080
executioner and bouncer and so like you

121
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:30,160
you can ask to talk to my manager but

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:33,039
it's also me yeah okay so another thing

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,440
to keep in mind I'd ask that the

124
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,690
spellers repeat the term back to me

125
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,540
before you spell it so I make sure you

126
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,890
heard it right I haven't been in a panel

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,720
in this room today so I'm not sure

128
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:47,200
exactly how the acoustics you're going

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,390
to work but the the curious role of

130
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,729
Spelling Bee announcer is that I want

131
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,349
you all to succeed and then all of you

132
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,320
eventually fail except for one person so

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,620
anything I can do to help you within the

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,060
rules of the beat I will try to do so be

135
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,500
sure to repeat it back so I make sure

136
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,840
your your hearing if it's a plural

137
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,430
version or a you know some conjugation

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,320
of the word okay you as the speller can

139
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,450
ask for certain things you can ask to

140
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,659
hear the term repeated you can ask for

141
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,010
part of speech a sort of additional

142
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,440
information kind of like a short

143
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,909
definition or an example sentence you

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,040
can ask for this as many times as you

145
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,140
want if there are pronunciation variants

146
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,700
I'll say that up top so you don't have

147
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:34,960
to worry about that being Trixie I have

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,430
a little friendly speller sheet that I

149
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,859
will have up here to remind you of the

150
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:44,290
things that you can ask me okay so if

151
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,900
you the speller do not ask a clarifying

152
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,210
question and there is a homophone for

153
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,489
that term so capital blackhat versus

154
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,780
lowercase blackhat and you spell the

155
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,940
wrong one that's considered incorrect

156
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,330
for the B so it's better to ask at least

157
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,870
a question if you if you feel like you

158
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:05,800
might get the wrong one we're going to

159
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,600
skip that one okay next thing is no

160
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,960
take-backs you can't change your answers

161
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,970
once you begin this tragically happened

162
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,979
in a college spelling bee not to me but

163
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,350
someone else the word was hygiene and

164
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:21,210
they were very concerned about the vowel

165
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,470
part of the word and they said gee and

166
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,888
they were wrong because hygiene does not

167
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,020
start with a G so

168
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,930
it did happen in the practice be also

169
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,919
that that somebody was concerned about a

170
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,509
part of the word and they started

171
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,818
spilling their unfortunately that will

172
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,590
mean you're out so think about the

173
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,830
letters you're about to say say who

174
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,539
intentionally because you can't change

175
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,810
them you can restart if it helps you to

176
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:49,830
gain momentum but you can't change what

177
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,270
you've already said okay so if it helps

178
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,188
you spellers you can do any of the

179
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,870
following while you think you can mime

180
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,400
writing the term in the air you can

181
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,020
trace it on your shirt with a finger you

182
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,878
can trace it on your arm

183
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,279
you can type it in the air or you can

184
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,810
text it in the air I've been told on

185
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,550
good authority from people involved in

186
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,159
the scripts be that spellers have done

187
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,409
all of those things in competition so

188
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:14,340
whatever helps you muscle memory

189
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:17,879
remember what's going on go for it okay

190
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,888
so the the evil twist of this B is that

191
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,460
capitalization will count the first

192
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,500
three rounds

193
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,169
everything will be lower case and then

194
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,520
in round four everything will contain at

195
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,710
least one capital letter to kind of

196
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,000
practice and then after round four

197
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:36,649
they'll be mixed in at random I think

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,649
that's all I have to say about that

199
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,328
I'm just trying to let you know so later

200
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,269
when you're mad at me I I know I told

201
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:47,699
you earlier you still made me bad but

202
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll know I told you okay so if you do

203
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,060
if you have a capitalization you should

204
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,740
assume that the letters are

205
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,199
automatically lowercase so capitulation

206
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,959
ization needs to be called out like you

207
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:59,010
have shift key but not caps lock so if

208
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,260
you were saying gdpr

209
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:07,199
the capital G capital D capital P

210
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:10,079
capital R lowercase is implied if you

211
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:13,529
want to you can also say the lowercase

212
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,269
if it's in a mixed word so for the

213
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,829
abbreviation of man-in-the-middle you

214
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,170
could say capital m lowercase i

215
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,000
lowercase t capital m that's the way we

216
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,769
happen to do it in our reports that's

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,560
not in the beat obviously since it's an

218
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:29,070
example word you can say capital X or

219
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,609
uppercase X whichever one you prefer

220
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:35,089
so if spellers are incorrect the

221
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,369
announcer well thing about Oregon

222
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:50,659
or both and the audience will go oh

223
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:53,629
let's practice just tryna I'm parched

224
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,799
okay so if at least one speller has

225
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,299
already spelled successfully in the

226
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,269
round the incorrect speller should go

227
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,978
join the crowd in this fee the winner

228
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,449
will correctly spell one more term than

229
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:07,129
everyone else so it's not like scripts

230
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:08,508
so if everyone spells incorrectly in the

231
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,279
first round except for one person

232
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:13,899
that one person wins and then we're out

233
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,309
of here but if at least two spellers are

234
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:20,029
successful in around then we continue on

235
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:21,499
to the next round so and if all

236
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,409
remaining spellers are eliminated in a

237
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:26,659
single round they all return so that's

238
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,509
the end and then here's that little

239
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,169
asterisk you should expect the

240
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,939
unexpected

241
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,978
if the last few spellers are amazingly

242
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:38,179
difficult to eliminate I may introduce

243
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:41,539
variant rules into the B so you know

244
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:45,169
watch out for that yeah if you want to

245
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:48,019
but it seems like actively not helping

246
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:55,519
your cause in a spelling bee to have

247
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:57,079
trouble pronouncing things and then the

248
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,849
prizes are there spellers you get to

249
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,468
keep your IDs as prizes if you want to

250
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:03,469
swap all your letters around that's

251
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:05,209
that's fine by me and then the winner

252
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:06,319
also gets a novelty prize bag in

253
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:09,138
addition to that which we will talk

254
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:12,049
about when we get there so if you want

255
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,359
to tweet about this at a point I have a

256
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,529
hashtag that's my Twitter account and if

257

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,350
but it's not very interesting to me so I

262
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:44,329
didn't remember it yes that's right it

263

you're a good man mark all right Oh real

266
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:04,560
questions capitalization is the only

267
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,630
thing if there's a space or - I don't

268
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:21,300
care it's just it's just the letters and

269

the capitalization rate you yeah you

270

those cases right yes

272
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm it's a benign thing to do all right

273
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,319
well I hope you stick around to at least

274

your term is hyper-threading can you use

382
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,730
it in a sentence sure this is from its

383
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Wikipedia page it must be true so it

384
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,820
must be true ladies and gentlemen this

385
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,900
lovely style guide is not a dictionary

386
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,178
dictionaries have all the words style

387
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,650
guides only have the tricky ones that

388
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,210
you need to talk about or have usage

389
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,070
issues about and so I do not have

390
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,539
definitions in the style guide for most

391
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,240
of these so that's why the example

392
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,860
sentences and many of the additional

393
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,620
information are from somewhere else so

394
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,449
from the Wikipedia page the main

395
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,770
function of hyper-threading is to

396
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,140
increase the number of independent

397
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,600
instructions in the pipeline it takes

398
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,429
advantage of superscalar architecture in

399
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,139
which multiple instructions operate on

400
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:29,140
separate data in parallel I'd like that

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:16,949
unless you want to be yeah although I I

440
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,000
don't want you to be behind the podium

yeah alright so as with all spelling

443
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,750
bees they're inherently uneven because

444
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,820
everyone's experience is different I

445
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,710
tried to make it as even as I could but

446
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,809
again I'm sure there will be complaints

447
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,960
and you can take it up with me and I

448
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,299
have the same answer okay in round three

449
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,210
all of these terms are from the style

450
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:48,059
guide but in case n of you weirdly

451
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,400
studied all 103 of its pages these are

452
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,379
not the head words these are words that

453
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,030
appear in the style guide in the actual

454
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:59,850
entries so this just a this is just a a

455
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,010
gentle shot across the bow that later

456
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,590
more terrifying words from the entries

457
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:08,850
will appear but this is just introducing

458
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,500
the concept as part of the tutorial no

459
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,870

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,600
actually the very first entry we start

470
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:16,260
with punctuation and we're like how do

471
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,669
you order punctuation and the answer is

472
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,340
QWERTY so we start with an exclamation

473
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,760
point that's how it starts starts with a

474

can say a capital or uppercase and you

516
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,120
should assume that all the letters are

00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,550
lowercase unless you specify so if it's

582
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,220
yes this is the city in the South Bay

583
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,760
where the main Kappa main campus of

584
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,080
Apple is at 1 infinite loop and it's

585
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,240
about five minutes away from my mom's

586
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:21,720
house

587
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:24,450
Cupertino capital C you PE are pin3 nice

588
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,410
I have that term in there because of the

589
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,810
Cupertino effect where the early Apple

590
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,149
dictionary had cooperate only with a

591
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,820
hyphen between the co and the operate

592
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,740
and so if you wrote cooperate without a

593
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,050
hyphen it Auto changed it to Cupertino

594
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,029
that's like we really got a Cupertino on

595
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:45,630
this project so it's the Cupertino

596
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:49,590
effect so lesson about dictionaries so I

597
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:55,320
put it in the guide all right your term

598
00:39:49,590 --> 00:40:00,450
is gamergate what were the rules on

599
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:03,570
cheating again you can but I won't give

600
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:06,600
you prizes so I mean you can go out

601
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,440
however you want but it doesn't lead to

602
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:13,670
victory

603
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:18,050
that's right it's about capital G a em

604
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,620
er G a te correct it seems to be the

605
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,000
standardized way that people write it

606
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:26,089
alright that's the end of that run whoo

607
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,470
good job everybody round Ford did

608
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,840

609
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,910
give a sticker to as they exited if I

610
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:42,070
did you um you got a sticker if you want

611
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:45,020
it you go okay so this is round five and

612
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:48,860
this is the first round where uppercase

613
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:53,120
and lowercase will be mixed and so in in

614
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:55,640
my gracious benevolence in this round

615
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,770
and this round only I will give you two

616
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,960
terms and you get to choose which one

617
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,390
you want to spell and then the next

618
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,130
person will either then spell the one

619
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,690
you didn't choose or another one I pull

620
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,350
out of the bag so you get to pick your

621
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,140
poison you have a little more control it

622
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,850
may bite you but it's it's all up to you

623
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,310
yeah I don't like having choices

624
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,310

alright so this is this is because of

658
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,070
the term embarrassingly parallel in the

659
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,170
guide and the quote I have is from

660
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,760
actors Kristen Bell who once said I'm

661
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,220
empathetic to a fault

662
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,080
I really do embarrassingly enough tear

663
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,080
up when someone squishes a bug in front

664
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,370
of me

665
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:34,020
relatable embarrassingly right that's

666
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:42,410
embarrassingly it's making sure that's

667
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:46,009
right that is one EMBA RRAS s ing ly

668
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,009

672
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:12,400
wrongly accuse people of murder here

673
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:13,270
everyone is complaining all right well

674
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:23,110
I'm fired

675
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:48,810

682
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:32,369
reset for a second here okay

683
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:33,960
all right I just I kind of feel like

684
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:35,369
giving you two new words just to have a

685
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,990
clean slate how do you feel about that

686
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:47,930
whatever you just kind of okay all right

687
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:55,859
okay all right your two options are

688
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:59,730
Dvorak and I car use the second sentence

689
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:02,130
please okay I car this is from the eicar

690
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,170
test file Wikipedia page the use of the

691
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,760
eicar test string can be more versatile

692
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,380
than straightforward detection a file

693
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,849
containing the eicar test string can be

694
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,829
compressed are archived and then the

695
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:12,540
antivirus software can be run to see

696
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:21,000
whether or not it can detect the test

697
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:24,869
string in the compressed file hi car

698
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:31,310
capital e capital e capital C capital a

699
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:33,359
capital R correct heinous heinous I

700
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,680
learned about that at work I learned

701
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,900
about a lot of these at work that's kind

702
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,480
of why I made the guide but that one

703
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:46,109
particularly okay so your options are

704
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:48,690
Dvorak or dependency all right I'm good

705
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:51,348
for it okay and I'm going to type it in

706
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,349
my Dvorak keyboard

707
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:09,459
Dvorak capital D V o RAK correct

708
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:12,950
very nice same spelling as the composer

709
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:17,530
Dvorak but that one is anglicized for

710
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:33,430
whatever reason alright your terms are

711
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:33,430
dependency for collision for which okay

712
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:40,788
all right so this comes from the the

713
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:43,960
hash collision attack entry and this is

714
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:46,099
sentence that I made the AP style the

715
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,780
journalist style guide used to have a

716
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:49,579
stupid rule that things could not be in

717
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,920
a collision unless they were both moving

718
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:53,660
so a moving train could not collide with

719
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:19,160
a stops train but they have since

720
00:48:53,660 --> 00:49:22,549
removed that correct that's the glory of

721
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:27,440
the spelling bee all right your terms

722
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:29,800
are dependency or anonymous I can't

723
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:38,980
spell ARPANET

724
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:48,640
no dependency dependency animus or

725
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:50,050
anonymous please let's spell honest but

726
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,509
I'd like to hear it in a sentence first

727
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:57,610
okay mm-hmm we are anonymous we are

728
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:07,060
legion we do not forgive we do not

729
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:09,760
forget expect us now I'm afraid let's go

730
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:28,779
with anonymous beginning with capital a

731
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:31,990
ñ ó n ÿ M O us correct all right

732
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:35,230
that's right it might have been a trap

733
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:40,390
all right your term is either dependency

734
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:47,890
or DuckDuckGo can you use dependency in

735
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:49,359
an archer quote I tragically I have no

736
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:56,920
Archer quote I have a David Attenborough

737
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:58,300
quote actually for this I really really

738
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,030
really can't

739
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,400
so David Attenborough once said the only

740
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:05,200
way to save a rhinoceros is to save the

741
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,970
environment in which it lives because

742
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,830
there is a mutual dependency between it

743
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:14,350
and millions of other species of both

744
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:19,600
animals and plants dependency DEP E and

745
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:23,319
D E and C why correct those because of

746
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:26,290
our dependency held entry all right that

747
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:32,480
was around five yay

748
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:36,470
only slight chaos okay all right so

749
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,560
Europe first this round all of the terms

750
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:42,560
are somehow related to next contestant

751
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:45,170
is Peter Griffin Wow Peter

752
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,270
your word is tree can you use it in a

753
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,270
sentence please there is a tree by the

754
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,339
link huh can you use it in a dirty

755
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,990
sentence I like to bring transient

756
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:56,000
hookers to the old oak tree where I

757
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,680
asphyxiate myself at the same time I'm

758
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:15,109
watching them have sex with each other

759
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:18,919
TR EE 3 correct it's not a great example

760
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:21,560
sentence for sex workers but alright so

761
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:28,760
all of the terms in this round are

762
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:31,250
somehow related to sci-fi dystopia you

763
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:38,869
know AI that kind of a lot of fictional

764
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:40,849
stuff a lot of random stuff you know

765
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:44,869
where how many don't we're down to seven

766
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:46,970
people um I will I'll ask the spellers

767
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:53,540
spellers would you would you like two

768
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:56,149
choices in this round as well how do you

769
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,480
feel speller at the podium you like

770
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,770
choices

771
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,080
alright we'll do it for this round and

772
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:02,509
then never again we will do it for this

773
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,369
round I don't want to I don't want to be

774
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,830
a gatekeeper and shame you for not

775
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:08,570
knowing something from one property

776
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,710
rather than another okay so we're gonna

777
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:12,530
do for this round and then never again

778
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:15,980
so again this could be capitalized or

779
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:20,060
not and your tur your two terms to

780
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:22,780
choose from are totalitarian and F

781
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,779
Society

782
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,900
sure oh this is just Aldous Huxley all

783
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,360
right

784
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,400
Aldous Huxley once said greatest truths

785
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,890
but still greater from a practical point

786
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,210
of view is silence about truth by simply

787
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,250
not mentioning certain subjects

788
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,110
totalitarian propagandists have

789
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,850
influenced opinion much more effectively

790
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:46,869
than they could have by the most

791
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:49,310
eloquent denunciations

792
00:53:46,869 --> 00:54:14,000
it's from our it's from our big brother

793

798

all right your term is either Borg or

799
00:54:50,180 --> 00:55:13,288
dystopian dystopian dy s t.o.p I am

Borg or Cylon you can only avoid it for

802
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:27,329
so long I prefer the original series

803
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:44,849
with Wayne Lorne Greene anyway

804
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:51,440
Borg capital B o-r-g correct okay your

805
00:55:44,849 --> 00:56:00,109

00:55:51,440 --> 00:56:00,109
capital C why L am correct very nice

807
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:12,200
your term is either BMO or cyberpunk

808
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:19,950
please use cyberpunk in a sentence okay

809
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:22,380
oh this is a William Gibson okay William

810
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:25,319
Gibson said a snappy label and a

811
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:27,239
manifesto would have been two of the

812
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,279
very last things on my own career want

813
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,049
list that 1/8 that label enabled

814
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:32,849
mainstream science fiction to safely

815
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:34,200
assume inant assimilates our dissident

816
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:36,420
influence such as it was

817
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,308
cyberpunk could then be embraced and

818
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,410
given prizes and patted on the head and

819
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:46,710
genre science fiction could continue

820
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:50,379
unchanged good one cyberpunk c/y be e r

821
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:52,509
pu n ke correct

822
00:56:50,380 --> 00:57:03,670
[Applause]

823
00:56:52,509 --> 00:57:08,809
alright okay your term is either BMO or

824
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:13,900
replicant can he use replicant in a

825
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:23,839
sentence from the movie Blade Runner

826
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:33,140
you're not a replicant straight from the

827
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:34,460
movie those memos are EPLI Zant correct

828
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,558
all right

829
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:39,049
very nicely done it's interesting

830
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,150
because some of those fictional half

831
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:42,349
robot e-type things if they're an alien

832
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,049
race like Borger Cylon they're

833
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:46,940
capitalized and otherwise they're not

834
00:57:44,049 --> 00:57:49,309
BMO for the record is a character from

835
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:52,069
adventure time who's a video game

836
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:55,579
console shaped cartoon robot friend and

837
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:58,900
its capital B capital m capital o all

838
00:57:55,579 --> 00:58:03,109
right so we're moving on to Round seven

839
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:07,160
and do I have any special notes for this

840
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:07,660
round you can you can go up there if

841
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,089
you'd like

842
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:15,230
nope these are just hypothetically more

843
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:17,808
difficult it's what this round is so no

844
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:27,970
choice just the term I pull out of the

845
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:33,140
bag all right so your term is webdev

846
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:35,180
WebDAV yes sure

847
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,069
from its Wikipedia page the most

848
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,930
important features of the web dev

849
00:58:37,069 --> 00:58:40,400
protocol include the maintenance of

850
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,399
properties about an author or

851
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,759
modification date namespace management

852
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:50,269
collections and overwrite protection

853
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:53,150
it's an X's it's an extension of HTTP

854
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:56,490
that allows clients to perform and

855
00:58:53,150 --> 00:59:00,690
remove web content authoring

856
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:03,240
phrasing I'm sorry sorry allows clients

857
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:23,000
to remove web content authoring

858
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:27,560
operations correct yeah all right

859
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,560
your term is systematically

860
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:49,400
systematically sy s tem-8 e IC al ly

861
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:49,400
correct your term is reproducible

862
00:59:54,080 --> 01:00:10,770
reproducible ar e P R o D you see I ble

863
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:12,500
correct very nice I was worried that was

864
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:20,280
gonna be some sort of American English

865
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:23,640
difference yeah I was like oh no I do

866
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:26,370
have in the style guide we have you know

867
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,620
gray hat and gray box and those tend to

868
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:31,380
change a Y and ey but for some reason

869
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:33,150
gray listing I think is ey all the time

870
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,520
this is weird

871
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:43,830
things you learn okay ready for your

872

874
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:51,900
its Wikipedia page putty does not

875
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:56,250
support session tabs directly but many

876
01:00:51,900 --> 01:01:02,420
rappers are available that do putty PU

[Applause]

892
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:41,150
listicle please repeat the term your

893
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:42,740
term is listicle I'm having trouble

894
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:46,940
hearing if you're saying listicle or

895
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:49,910
listicle listicle listicle yes would you

896
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:55,220
please use that in any way at all sure

897
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:58,160
as many one from an episode of Parks and

898
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:01,310
Recreation whoosh just won the pulitzer

899
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:07,629
prize for best top-ten listicle it's an

900
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:07,630
article in the form of a list ok

901
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:25,130
listicle list3 nice it's the style guide

902
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,350
is mainly for formal technical reports

903
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:29,480
but it also acknowledges the existence

904
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:33,319
of the Internet where strange things

905
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:35,930
happen and memes and BuzzFeed is

906
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,000
well-known for listicles but in the

907
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:42,980
BuzzFeed style guide they say not to use

908
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,330
that term it's a great style guide

909
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:47,650
though they update all the time much

910
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:50,180
more often than this probably will and

911
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:53,090
they they cover more memes than we do

912
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:58,220
but we sort of we merge in where if when

913
01:03:53,090 --> 01:04:04,210
it seems relevant that's it's for you to

914
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:06,109
say all right so your term is consortium

915
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:08,960
consortium can you use it in the

916
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:12,800
sentence please sure from the movie

917
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:16,060
Armageddon he's also the head of a

918
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,060
scientific consortium

919
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:25,380
consortium CEO n SOR TI um

920
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:28,079
correct very nice this appears in the

921
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:31,589
Unicode consortium entry but this is

922
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,589
also just the generic version all right

923
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:38,930
so that's the end of that round yeah

924
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:42,750
okay okay all right

925
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:44,399
round eight probably probably more

926
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:50,930
difficult again hard to tell you with

927
01:04:44,400 --> 01:05:10,500
spelling bees in words okay your term is

928
01:04:50,930 --> 01:05:13,440
identifiable yes correct that comes from

929
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:19,640
our RPI I entry personally identifiable

930
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:25,920
information very nice all right

931
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:27,420
your term here is disingenuous use it in

932
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,020
a sense I can make sure that it's not

933
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:34,440
some open source sure oh it's always

934
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:37,140
happy to the actor Paul Giamatti once

935
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,980
said it'd be disingenuous to say I don't

936
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,900
like attention

937
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,460
I'm an actor for God's sake and it's

938
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,290
flattering and all but attention was

939
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:45,599
never my big goal I just like to work

940
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:49,670
and have a good time disingenuous

941
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,670
appears in our humble brag entry

942
01:05:51,680 --> 01:06:06,509
disingenuous D is I and GE and you owe

943
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:10,770
us correct very nice very nice alright

944
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:23,760
your term is retro actively retro

945
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:26,060
actively r e t ro a CT i v le y o-- e at

946
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,060
the end

947
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:34,119
thank you for your excellent

948
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:36,779
participation very very nice guys give

949
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:36,779
me a fanfare

950
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:52,710
all right your term is epilogue epilogue

951
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:55,239
mm-hmm

952
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:57,519
lay a sentence on me please just a

953
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:59,619
double check sure we're all suspicious

954
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,209
at this point yeah and he should be

955
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,630
that's certainly what I've trained you

956
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,940
to do

957
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:08,559
it's like whimsy but also very strict

958
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:10,569
rules okay so the TV writer Jeffrey Bell

959
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,670
once said one of the things that just is

960
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:15,549
key talks about is that no character is

961
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:17,440
too high to fall and no character is too

962
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:19,450
low to be redeemed Crime and Punishment

963
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,769
began with a person going out and

964
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:23,109
consciously becoming a cold-blooded

965
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:25,419
murderer and it took 800 pages and an

966
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:42,670
epilogue before the person finally asked

967
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:44,289
for forgiveness correct very nice the

968
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:47,589
style guide the very last page of the

969
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:50,739
style guide is our epilogue which has an

970
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:52,869
entry for muff freeze law which is an

971
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:56,650
addendum to Murphy's Law my freeze law

972
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:58,359
is that anytime you talk or write about

973
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:00,910
language you will make language mistakes

974
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:04,269
and if you make a style guide it will

975
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,739
contradict itself and so I'm glad that I

976
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:07,859
proved that earlier with the

977
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:13,749
embarrassingly embarrassing

978
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:21,580
entry good job all right so your term is

979
01:08:13,749 --> 01:08:24,040
licensed sure singer Lyle Lovett once

980
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,670
said if you forget the words to your own

981
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,500
song

982
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:28,779
you can always claim artistic license

983
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:38,649
forget the words to the national anthem

984
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:40,650
and you're screwed correct very nicely

985
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:48,429
done

986
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:55,899

01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:59,318
the next round

989
01:08:56,469 --> 01:09:02,380
I just I have have a lot around eight

990
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:06,460
words but we don't need them all right

991
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:08,109
you can go to the podium and um I don't

992
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,819
have it in front of me anymore but did

993
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:11,469
did you write down a term that you have

994
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:13,000
trouble spelling did you write that down

995
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:17,290
we're gonna you were a late entry here

996
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,969
so the the early signups the idea was

997
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:20,500
for the sign-up sheet today was you

998
01:09:18,969 --> 01:09:22,868
write down your handle and the term that

999
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,549
you have trouble spelling so if you were

1000
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:26,080
if you're gonna write one down what do

1001
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:28,630
you think that term would be you're just

1002
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,278
like something like if you have previous

1003
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,750
Spelling Bee experience this we're doing

1004

1010
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:54,009
learn about the spellers you're getting

1011
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:55,480
so rowdy do you is there you don't have

1012

to share any personal information I just

1013
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,619
thought it would be like a nice moment

1014

1019
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:19,000
of the same again capitalization can be

1020
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:22,929
mixed in just whatever piece of paper I

1021
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:26,730
pull out of this bag okay so your term

1022
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:26,730
is Lou

1023

sure in lieu of flowers please donate to

1024
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,080
the e FF on my behalf

1025
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:49,430
correct I do have a story associated

1026
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:54,549
with mine

1027
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:58,070
oh good so is the word Calliope yes and

1028
01:10:54,550 --> 01:11:05,050
so I was studying first spelling bee it

1029
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:07,190
was like a tri-state area and my mom

1030
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:10,040
continuously hounded me on the word

1031
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:13,580
Calliope for a very long time and then

1032
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,680
the last word that I had to spell before

1033
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,750
we ended the R at the beginning round

1034
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,090
and moved on to the finals round was

1035
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:22,640
Calliope oh and I did spell it correctly

1036
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:24,920
the word that I got out on was pedestal

1037
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,380
which would have been much better to put

1038
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,380
and I was very upset with myself at the

1039
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:36,200
moment that I put a a after the D and I

1040
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:38,180
was like yeah yeah yeah anyway say thank

this this will confuse me but I kept it

1046
01:11:55,539 --> 01:12:03,880
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber once said right

1061
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:16,420
I'm living in Canada like a problem

1062
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:18,039
they're all welcome at my house and I

1063
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:19,179
think it's a British versus American

1064
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:21,039
spelling which you haven't actually

1065
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:26,050
covered all that well but the word was

1066
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:28,179
labeled oh yeah yeah I think I can spell

1067
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:30,579
it but but i but I also think that might

1068
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:33,099
there might be ambiguity in there in the

1069
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:33,969
process yeah but really I can really

1070
01:13:33,099 --> 01:13:35,650
mess with you

1071
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:37,269
fortunately there is now official

1072
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:40,150
Canadian dictionary so you don't have to

1073
01:13:37,269 --> 01:13:44,920
just pick and choose from the Oxford in

1074
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:46,478
the Webster's but oh all right that's

1075
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,239

from its Wikipedia page and this just

1082
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:07,190
seemed very straightforward ecstatic is

1083
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,760
a Russian language crime forum and

1084
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:13,610
marketplace what yeah that's what it

1085

1092
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:44,830
that hard to parse yeah well it seemed I

1093

ready for your to firm your term is

1115
01:16:48,530 --> 01:17:02,450
restful sure from its Wikipedia page six

1116
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,339
guiding constraints define a restful

1117
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:06,019
system these constraints restrict the

1118
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:07,550
ways the server can process and respond

1119
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:09,020
to client requests so that by operating

1120
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,430
within these constraints the service

1121
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,630
gains desirable non-functional

1122
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:14,270
properties such as performance

1123
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:15,980
scalability simplicity modify ability

1124
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:18,050
visibility portability and reliability

1125
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:20,030
if a service violates any of the

1126
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:25,640
required constraints it cannot be

1127
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:26,570
considered restful can use a different

1128
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:32,150
word please

1129
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:33,620
I mean no one no one's a big fan of this

1130
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:36,710
round at the moment

1131
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:40,610
[Music]

1132

ful correct all right okay this round

1134
01:17:56,650 --> 01:18:01,370
the worst thing about the worst way that

1135
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,170
a spelling bee can end is if the person

1136
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:14,110
runs out of words so that is not what's

1137
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:20,590
going to happen tonight I know okay so

1138
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:24,860
in in this round they are they're more

1139
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:27,350
like phrases not phrases but like there

1140
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:29,719
might be more than one word so again I

1141
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:31,340
don't care about hyphens or spacing it's

1142
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:41,330
just about letters and capitalization

1143
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:47,630
and things like that okay so you're free

1144

01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:02,690

1179
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,770
individual could use the dirty cow

1180
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,480
vulnerability to escalate their

1181
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:43,600
