1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:08,730
morning so thanks to everyone for coming

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,349
out this morning to see our talk it was

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,469
a great lead-in coming off of BIA and

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,870
the other guy Ranger speech they were

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,240
amazing and we're kind of a logical

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,788
extension from that a little bit of an

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,310
older set we're going to address but BIA

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,410
and an Rangers passion was was

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,840
particularly great my name is Mathieu

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,539
Weinberg I am currently a security

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,450
analyst at a big bank down the street

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,450
but I came up through the ranks of the

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,380
undergraduate and graduate curriculum in

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,180
computer security as well as

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,450
international relations and political

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,670
science and introduced me and IMing Chow

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,530
and from the Tufts University Department

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,340
of Computer Science senior lecturer over

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,550
there and we also want to give a special

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,170
shout-out in the morning to our my

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,169
colleague and our colleague Jeff

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,500
Taliaferro who I co-taught the course

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,960
with and he's here in spirit I can't be

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,470
with a happy with us today but he's in

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,900
spirit so actually getting first to the

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,310
title of our talk lessons from an

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,650
undergraduate course in cyber security

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,780
and cyber warfare is our children

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,630
securing now I got a little bit of flack

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,220
when I was actually proposing the title

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,070
of this from for my internal

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,170
organization is our children securing

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,589
that's not grammatically correct well

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,110
you know it isn't but we actually had a

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,090
former president ask the question in a

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,799
speech is our children learning and I

37
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,710
thought well maybe that's a good lead-in

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,560
to what our main focus is for our talk

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,509
and that is at a higher education level

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,079
are we really teaching our children

41
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,590
about security in the way that we intend

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,929
to

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,299
are we really transcending boundaries in

44
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,100
terms of getting the computer science

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,140
department and other parts of the

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,820
university together to combat some of

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,350
the issues and teach about some of the

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,869
issues that we're seeing now in the real

49
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,839
world so in this way this is how we

50
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,550
couch the the talk and we'll speak about

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,710
how we went about doing it at the

52
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,810
undergraduate level so I want to

53
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,010
with a little motivation and to

54
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:22,760
understand why we taught this course and

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:27,410
the timing of it who was here at hope

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,720
two years ago was anyone at the crypto

57
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,170
would talk with Matt blaze and sandy

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:36,620
Clark was in it and well this was from

59
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,769
the one of the concluding slides in

60
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,780
which they describe Lily said word for

61
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,530
word we are now in a national

62
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,230
cybersecurity crisis and one of the last

63
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,980
slide was the challenges that we face

64
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,549
now and from you know I took a picture

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,619
of of the slide because it really really

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,300
still hits me up to this day and what

67
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,860
the real hard problems in cybersecurity

68
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,810
yeah and you know the the the the okay

69
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,490
challenge is the good it did you know

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,680
moderately difficult challenges that you

71
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,080
know the technology side of things but

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,840
the real hard problem in cybersecurity

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,300
is really the policy in the legal parts

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,970
of it not the tech part not the

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,180
technical part of cybersecurity but the

76
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,460
legal and policy side of things and you

77
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,510
may be wondering okay so our talk is

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:32,150
about a course an academic course on

79
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,660
cybersecurity and cyber warfare which is

80
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,060
a mix of Tech and non tech you may be

81
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,340
wondering is there really a demand I

82
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,950
mean is there a real demand for for

83
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,840
something like this and the end the

84
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,489
answer is absolutely yes and here's two

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,530
very crystal clear anecdotes one Michael

86
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,600
Sumire who is the director of

87
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,460
cybersecurity project at the Berkman

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,870
Center at Harvard actually asked on

89
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,180
Twitter when can everyone happy a

90
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,520
conversations on Twitter designing a

91
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,940
cybersecurity course for law students

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,090
and on the right we have Bobby Chesney

93
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,560
who's the associate dean of at the law

94
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,720
school to the University of Texas even

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,380
brought up ok what should a cyber

96
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,230
security course and law and policy

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,600
should cover so this question has been

98
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,120
you know it's not only a need for this

99
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,919
but there's also a lot of debates and

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,010
question what should go on in such a

101
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,390
very broad

102
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,580
course so when I first joined yes this

103
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,760
project with with Ming and Jeff tally

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,070
pair up at Tufts we started off with

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,539
some kind of core beliefs and actually

106
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,630
laying out you know what our main task

107
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,730
is and our core belief at least between

108
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,219
me and myself was that the lack of

109
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,170
progress that we saw in cybersecurity is

110
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,120
due to the knowledge and the cultural

111
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,580
gaps between the technical and the non

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,190
technical communities and I have a

113
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,109
former dean at the Fletcher School Dean

114
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,850
Steve Reedus you know always would talk

115
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,950
about building intellectual bridges

116
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,800
between communities and so in this

117
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,450
course we were really looking forward to

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,830
building commute bridges between the

119
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,000
communities of political science and

120
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,010
international relations which is a

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,870
strong suit at our university with the

122
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,909
computer science department and having

123
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,340
the two student bodies come together and

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,650
share what they know and what they've

125
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,020
learned with each other to overcome

126
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,440
particular challenges so that was our

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,659
task that's what we really set out to do

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,910
now in terms of each community itself in

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,160
addressing them the political science in

130
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,250
international relations so PS and I are

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,870
in short speak it was to expose them to

132
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,840
a lot of the technical aspects of

133
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,400
cybersecurity which as you can see in

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,679
their daily lives right now you know

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,260
have emerged as important aspects of the

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
international security environment so it

137
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,140
was really important for them to kind

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,669
understand what is really out route with

139
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,110
a lot of the issues that we see from the

140
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,210
technical perspective that are going

141
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,990
over into the political science in the

142
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,609
IR domain and so also the course come at

143
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,820
perfect timing because we're now at a

144
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,040
time where and I'm sure a lot of you

145
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,750
folks are questioning you know you're

146
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,490
paying this much money to go for four

147
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,630
years at a private institution like what

148
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,520
are you really getting out of your money

149
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:17,070
and I can say that I reviewed I actually

150
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,539
got my hands on the external review from

151
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,640
political science and international

152
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,470
relations a tough and it was very

153
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,419
interesting reading them about like what

154
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,610
needs to be like were the content really

155
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,920
necessary in order to boost the program

156
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,770
up to you know the modern times and this

157
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,170
course actually was became a boon for

158
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,219
not only computer science but also for

159
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,739
the international relations and

160
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,079
political science programs at Tufts

161
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:42,479
and the computer science and want to

162
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,659
expose you know just basic policymaking

163
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,549
in to to the students just as

164
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:50,188
interesting because recently I was a

165
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:51,748
little bit too slow to read um Kate

166
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,669
Charlotte's paper on federal

167
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:56,939
cybersecurity which she published back

168
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,558
in April of 2018 and in the introduction

169
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,239
and I think she wrote something along

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,639
the line something along the lines it's

171
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:05,008
easier for me to teach tech that policy

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,459
people but it's much much more difficult

173
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:15,449
to teach policy to attack and to techies

174
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:17,369
so interesting line that you wrote you

175
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,499
know in in her report that called

176
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:21,869
coincide with the mission of this course

177
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,489
but you know at the end of the day

178
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:25,859
really is what we were trying to do is

179
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:27,688
hack the higher education system and in

180
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:30,419
the way like much hacking like we had

181
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,799
seen BIA and Ranger discuss earlier you

182
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,258
know we had to make this course

183
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:36,239
practical fun and enlightening for the

184
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,039
students because otherwise we were

185
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:40,138
sitting in here in a long room and it

186
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,369
wouldn't be fun for anyone you know so

187
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,289
we really had to make it interactive

188
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:45,569
amongst themselves to encourage the

189
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,429
students themselves much like our

190
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,559
university talks about is to encourage

191
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:53,159
active citizenship so to encourage

192
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:55,079
active info security citizenship and to

193
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,669
engage across all these different

194
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,899
communities that we had in the course

195
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,998
and all the different backgrounds that

196
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,069
we had whether it be gender whether it

197
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,019
be educational to have healthy debates

198
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,939
between themselves while they were in

199
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,369
the course yeah and let's be honest that

200
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,379
stuff doesn't happen and I'm sure for

201
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,939
most of us who've been in Mendeley

202
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,399
called before it doesn't happen that

203
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,019
often I mean we're still in and I would

204
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,789
still go so far to see a dinosaur age

205
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,619
system in which you know it's become

206
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,219
academic fragmentation when you have

207
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:25,499
like the mathematics department you have

208
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,939
political science standards own physics

209
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:28,259
stands on its own but you take a look at

210
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,819
the big modern problems now like

211
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,938
cybersecurity they transcend and blend

212
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,969
multiple multiple multiple departments

213
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:38,039
and even even schooled within an

214
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,419
institution I mean those days are just

215
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,110
standing on your own and just locking

216
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,429
yourself behind the door days along hobo

217
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,809
but we're not the only ones trying to do

218
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,939
this out there and we want to actually

219
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,259
give some props to other universities

220
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,240
and other programs that are actually

221
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,010
doing

222
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,540
much what we are doing as well and we

223
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,459
also learn from each other as well so

224
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,649
there is actually a community of these

225
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,930
types of courses that are out there give

226
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,480
a shout out to my former professor at

227
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,160
Harvard right now Bruce Schneier who a

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,810
lot of you probably do know he had

229
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,760
teaches a cybersecurity technology

230
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,890
policy law course the Harvard Kennedy

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,209
School as well as down the street at

232
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,360
Columbia University

233
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,550
Jason Healy and his program along with

234
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,740
Steve pehlivan and Matt Waxman teach a

235
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,779
course in also Technology Policy and law

236
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,910
at Columbia and they run an excellent

237
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,620
program up there and running also

238
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,689
outside the classroom some other unique

239
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,750
and interesting events that we'll get

240
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,360
into later so what did this actual class

241
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,089
look like you know it was it was pretty

242
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,410
well divided between the political

243
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,480
science and international relations

244
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,760
departments as well as the computer

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,850
science department the webs that you see

246
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,550
at 9% there are unicorns so they are our

247
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,620
dual majors they will have excellent

248
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,839
futures out there particularly because

249
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,089
they understand from an inherent basis

250
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,500
the technological as well as the

251
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,990
political and all the other human

252
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,630
organizational aspects of what we are

253
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,760
encountering in this world but having

254
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,649
said that what our main goal was is to

255
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,279
make sure that at least on either side

256
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,990
of the aisle of education that we had

257
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,399
both sides kind of understanding where

258
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,440
each other was coming from so that when

259
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,420
they do go out and enter into the career

260
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,950
field in the professional world they can

261
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,899
understand quite a bit of the issues

262
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,760
that either is facing and also just a

263
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,880
talk I mentioned just this a little bit

264
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,829
I'm sure you wondering what the I'm sure

265
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,390
if with any classes these date a lot of

266
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,989
people ask and what's the what's the

267
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:36,829
breakdown in terms of like gender and we

268
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,589
made it largely 5050 as best as we could

269
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:41,870
so wasn't skewed like an all gender and

270
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:47,149
one downside versus some others like a

271
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,370
lot of classes technical topics so what

272
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,680
did we cover in terms of technical

273
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,430
topics in this cybersecurity and cyber

274
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,400
warfare course the long story to make a

275
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,520
long story short we didn't do

276
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,920
anything elaborate in that we didn't do

277
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,660
anything elaborate or that special we

278
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,579
went through a lot of the real basic

279
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:12,110
tools such as you know

280
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,870
nmap showed an what kali linux is the

281
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,340
basic terminologies and vulnerabilities

282
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:23,480
closures and you know we glossed over

283
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,950
you know had a very high-level not we

284
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,290
didn't go too deep into things like

285
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,600
malware and internet of things but

286
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,060
overall in terms of the technical topics

287
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,900
it wasn't anything special no reverse

288
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,579
engineering there was no coding we

289
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,939
didn't get into the map behind crypto

290
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,640
and doing doing that stuff and on the

291
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,990
policy side we also started out a lot

292
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,090
with a basic international relations

293
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,260
theory for computer scientist to

294
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,320
understand you know things of what is

295
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,330
realism what is deterrence theory you

296
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,920
know some of the basics but what drives

297
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,080
you know are international order we

298
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,010
discussed and then we also of course got

299
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,310
into the privacy and surveillance

300
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,950
debates we got into what is cybercrime

301
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,630
and prime minister manali we talked a

302
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,310
lot about a really hot topic now in

303
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,020
terms of information operations and

304
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,540
information security and how it relates

305
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,310
back to cyber security as well as what

306
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,689
is the public in the private sector what

307
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,599
are they doing together what are they

308
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,540
not doing together in terms of securing

309
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,060
our nation and our world of course we

310
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,980
take some of actual practical works that

311
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,089
are out there right now in the studies

312
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,950
field so of course one of the taught

313
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,450
books right now is by Thomas readers

314
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,800
down at the School of Advanced

315
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,320
International Studies down at Johns

316
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,060
Hopkins University wrote an excellent

317
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,050
book called cyber water will not take

318
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,410
place

319
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,209
we also previewed movie called zero days

320
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,670
from Alex Gibney maybe some of you have

321
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,350
already seen it revolves around the

322
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,560
Stuxnet and the debates thereafter

323
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,420
around the weaponization and use of or

324
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,089
subversion of industrial control systems

325
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,640
in Iran and then lastly give a shout-out

326
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,920
to my friend Trey hair and as well as

327
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,500
Richard Harrison who have created what I

328
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,630
think is one of really strong books out

329
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,090
there compiling a lot of great works on

330
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,400
the contemporary issues in cybersecurity

331
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,530
as they relate to the international

332
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,060
environment

333
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,490
so we had students sample different

334
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,010
readings from there as well but having

335
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,450
said that when I first entered this

336
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,330
course to kind of assist Ming and

337
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,760
Geoffrey with the course creation we

338
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,710
also wanted to make sure that it was

339
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,750
practical for the students so it wasn't

340
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,760
us just handing a syllabus and saying

341
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,970
you're gonna read this and you're gonna

342
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,860
read that you know it also we also on

343
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,010
the computer science side didn't

344
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,780
necessarily need to do as much training

345
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,250
we wanted to focus and get them oriented

346
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,949
towards the different tools like being

347
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,170
said but we also were necessarily going

348
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,700
to address everything so yeah and of

349
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,050
course you know one of the funny

350
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,090
computer science question that I'll

351
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,260
always get from any course or what

352
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,030
programming language that we're gonna

353
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,939
use so when I actually said I'm gonna do

354
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,380
any programming it was it was a little

355
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,110
bit of a culture shock to a lot of

356
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,910
students and I guess you know loosely

357
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,170
speaking it just shows how brainwashing

358
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,459
over you know some of the students can

359
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,439
be you know sometimes when you go

360
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,850
through a program like this but I said

361
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,260
earlier you know in terms of the

362
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,510
technical topics we didn't do all

363
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,300
anything that was special the whole

364
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,189
point of this course you know it wasn't

365
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,790
to get billed like any in terms of any

366
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:24,000
gem the more important thing is as an

367
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,040
angel something I learned from Ed Felten

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,530
when I first got into cybersecurity in

369
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,569
2004 well the important goal of this

370
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,120
course is not only to build bridges to

371
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,240
have people talk to each other but also

372
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,720
to be informed what are the big issues

373
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,150
out there facing facing us in terms of

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,090
cybersecurity it's just the informed

375
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,800
piece not to gödel live in the weeds and

376
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,990
have people talk to each other that was

377
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,630
the main goal but if you did want to do

378
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,460
things like packet analysis a packet

379
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,580
analysis of password cracking I you know

380
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,200
take take my security course which the

381
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,490
content is actually all free I'm

382
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,990
actually currently teaching it online

383
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,210
this summer at this moment as we speak

384
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,890
this is all free the content out there

385
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,290
most labs well except for the capital

386
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,880
fly game haven't put that up live yet we

387
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,280
did have a couple students at this that

388
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,320
took this course first then went to

389
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,140
cybersecurity and I do know I have one

390
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,660
student here that I think a oh gee

391
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,580
okay so what did we actually do to make

392
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,040
this all practical and actually

393
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,790
interesting so you know first thing

394
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,250
first Ming who has extensive experience

395
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,469
running and having a capture the flag

396
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,030
administering those kinds of events we

397
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,680
actually you know of course laid out

398
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,990
we're gonna do a capture a flag to start

399
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,479
out with the course but I kind of came

400
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:48,330
in and said well that's all great and

401
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,260
yeah you can have someone from the

402
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,400
political science department in

403
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,410
international relations apartment

404
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,640
students sitting next to the computer

405
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,170
science student as they go through

406
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,180
capturing the flag and whatnot

407
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,910
but what is it really gonna be a benefit

408
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,160
to both here and oftentimes I see a lot

409
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,230
of captured a flag contest and they're

410
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,810
done in isolation if they're done

411
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,030
without any inkling of how does this CTF

412
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,369
actually apply to what we've seen in the

413
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,380
real world you know I want students when

414
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,300
they're doing this to feel like okay

415
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,340
this CTF that I just did actually

416
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,569
matters and connects to some things that

417
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,610
have actually happened

418
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,840
so I told me I said you know we really

419
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,090
need to add to the capture the flag

420
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,640
challenge or the write-ups we have to

421
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,490
say okay so you've gone through this CTF

422
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,860
what is you actually see here and name

423
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,600
of some particular policy implications

424
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,460
or actual events that you've seen out

425
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,650
there that tie back to the activity that

426
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,730
you just went through in that line what

427
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,709
Matt just said really still blows me

428
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,500
away and I'm very thankful that I

429
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,020
learned that from and I'm very very

430
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,820
happy and very thankful Matt brought

431
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,800
that out because I'll be honest is that

432
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,970
I've fallen into that trap as well with

433
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,949
you know because I've seen so many

434
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,780
captured a flag game I've seen well read

435
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,300
a lot of write-up involved it's all the

436
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,730
same thing but the real game changer

437
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,709
with our version of Capitol flag that we

438
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,990
have was when Matt brought up the idea

439
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,579
of you know in the write-up tell them we

440
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,620
also rather have the students to connect

441
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,149
the the things that they found in the

442
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,560
game and connect them to the real world

443
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:19,170
I'll give you two very concrete examples

444
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,919
from this game to mirror exactly what

445
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:25,470
Matt said so if you're interested what

446
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,870
the capture the flag the box was it was

447
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:34,170
just a Windows 2008 server unpatched

448
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,979
with Hackney casino running and the

449
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,230
administrator

450
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,179
was password it was the same one that

451
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:46,110
was used in John Podesta's gmail account

452
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:48,570
in the DNC hack in 2016 and some

453
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,889
students recognize that password yeah

454
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,689
this pass would look familiar with the

455
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,010
same one that John Podesta used and we

456
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,400
want a sentence we wanted them to

457
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:59,910
recognize that another one there was

458
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,320
sequel injection in the game and one

459
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:07,440
team whoa yeah this was the same attack

460
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,950
that was used for the whole masak for

461
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,620
sangkum s and that was like BAM that's

462
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,630
exactly what we wanted to get across so

463
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,870
you connect this with previous incidents

464
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,669
now why did we do that actually well you

465
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,320
know part of it was the policy

466
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,970
implications but when these students

467
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,639
actually go out in the real and working

468
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,540
world they are gonna be you know working

469
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,309
whether they're from political science

470
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,049
international ations whether they're

471
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,360
computer scientists together on issues

472
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,460
much like that so we wanted to have the

473
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,530
gender diversity involved one of the

474
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,760
different backgrounds involved and also

475
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,110
you know you've got the practical

476
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,960
problem that software always doesn't

477
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,729
work so we wanted to actually have them

478
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,370
come together in a kind of a real-world

479
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,570
situation to work together on this and

480
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,489
that was the most important thing that

481
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,280
that we discovered through that kind of

482
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,690
practical exercise now the next thing

483
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,399
that we did with the students is

484
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,200
something that you kind of see more of

485
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,090
in the policy world but it's also really

486
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,679
important for for computer scientists

487
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,840
evermore today as well

488
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,290
I call this did you happen to get that

489
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,730
memo because what you often see in the

490
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,500
working world especially whether you're

491
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,929
in DC or up here in New York on Wall

492
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,450
Street wherever your bosses have very

493
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:17,970
little time they have very little time

494
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,460
to understand maybe a 10-page thing or

495
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,900
whether you coded something but what we

496
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,020
really were trying to get out with the

497
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,630
students was communications whether they

498
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,270
could write for brevity clarity and

499
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,500
accessibility can you distill down some

500
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,629
of the technical topics that you're

501
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,010
seeing and explain it to someone who may

502
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,900
not have the similar technical

503
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,940
background as you or if it's a policy

504
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,200
makers still try to explain and what are

505
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,900
the technical dynamics that you're

506
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,390
seeing so what we directed the students

507
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,450
to do was take any issues of their

508
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,840
interest and direct that prick

509
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,639
issue to a c-suite executive a senior

510
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,539
policy maker someone in civil society

511
00:19:53,639 --> 00:20:00,899
and write really clearly two pages to

512
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,460
that particular audience did anyone want

513
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:06,209
to take a guess it was just it

514
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,399
completely blew me away still when Matt

515
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,749
was working he met with each and every

516
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,879
one of the student well especially

517
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,230
during the last minute does anyone want

518
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:17,039
to take a wild guess what were the

519
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,840
number one and number two number one and

520
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,519
then the number one mistake that a lot

521
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,859
of students made it would right off the

522
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,539
bat it would mind blowing then I won't

523
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:32,129
take a guess what the number one mistake

524
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:35,639
that every student made yeah it was some

525
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:42,689
of that some of that yeah yeah it was

526
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:45,408
that too would have been funny if they

527
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,789
actually did that I think part of it is

528
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,470
yeah there's something about being it

529
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,299
long and whatnot and we were able to

530
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,789
work on that but really getting your

531
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,739
point up front in the intelligence

532
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,629
business you have what's called the

533
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:59,700
bottom line up front or the bluff but

534
00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:01,350
really having the students think hard

535
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,980
about what they wanted to communicate

536
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:07,109
upfront to their senior leader decision

537
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,909
maker for all of us it's really hard for

538
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:10,619
me it's still hard as a professional and

539
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:12,029
I remembered from Matt what he kept on

540
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,220
asking each and every one of the

541
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:20,879
students was okay first things for a

542
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:22,859
home memo for so and that actually ties

543
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,869
back into my last point here in that

544
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,239
just writing a two-page memo is a

545
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:29,580
process for self-discovery what do I

546
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:31,440
want to write about and how do I write

547
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,119
to that person that audience that Ming

548
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,769
just brought up in a way that their

549
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,049
understanding to understand and that's

550
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,789
going to help them make a decision so in

551
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,340
that whole process I think that was a

552
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,259
self-discovery piece not only just as

553
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,668
themselves as communicators but also

554
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,019
what they're really interested in to

555
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,399
really distill down what is the

556
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,970
important issue that I want to tell

557
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:53,969
someone else okay now the third

558
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,289
engagement what we call the student pep

559
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,210
talks

560
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:00,210
so pep I think this was an original idea

561
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,230
coming from from Ming but we we altered

562
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,169
it a bit along with

563
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,299
Jeff but pet means personal engagement

564
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:09,000
projects and you know the main thing

565
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,980
that we tasked students to do was go out

566
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,169
there in the information security

567
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,230
community or the policy communities and

568
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:19,740
really try to find where your niche is I

569
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,540
had to talk once Jason Healy came up to

570
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,940
two tops he he had a really good

571
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,110
interesting story about someone one of

572
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,210
his students who come up to him and

573
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,070
students was I am you know gonna do this

574
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,929
in this and Jay is like well you know

575
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,689
everyone else is in that area what's

576
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,340
your unique niche what really drives you

577
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,049
outside of you know when you're in the

578
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,280
classroom you know what's something

579
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,720
that's from your background that you

580
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,160
spent a lot of time on you know

581
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,200
something that you'll do when you're you

582
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,240
know away from the field and you know

583
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,340
he's like I really like maritime studies

584
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,960
and I'm you know on the water a lot and

585
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,939
he's like well you know really focus

586
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,220
maybe your niche is you know maritime

587
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,260
cybersecurity there's a huge need for

588
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,790
that out there so what I really took

589
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,679
from that is you know for all the

590
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,780
students that I met with you know every

591
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,370
other day in the hall flags at the

592
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,660
Fletcher and really talking to them and

593
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,830
trying to understand you know why are

594
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,270
you in this course and what really

595
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,649
drives you when you're not out of it and

596
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:10,379
let's see if there's a particular

597
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,299
connection point between the two so from

598
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,450
there we test the students okay now get

599
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:18,179
into that area well two things number

600
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,450
one if we can't teach everything there's

601
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,370
no way but number two what really still

602
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:27,090
bothers me up to this day is there's a

603
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,918
lot of people that a don't realize don't

604
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,949
understand that cyber security is a very

605
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,750
broad field and that there are many

606
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,049
different paths and avenues to get to

607
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,190
your to do cyber security there are many

608
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,960
people that have many different

609
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,179
interests some people may absolutely

610
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,540
hate the technical people love the legal

611
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,190
people

612
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,110
some people may love the technical piece

613
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,669
but may actually really don't lay you

614
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,459
know don't want to do law or talk about

615
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,140
the policies and rule some people may

616
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,630
actually want to think about

617
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,220
cybersecurity in a non private sector

618
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,299
some people wanted to learn about

619
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,460
cybersecurity in a in a start-up and we

620
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,168
will want to do cybersecurity and a mega

621
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,730
corporation there are many many

622
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,830
different avenues many many different

623
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,150
flavors and we want to have that student

624
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,460
exposed because you're not going to get

625
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,570
that out of the classroom so again going

626
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,310
back to Matt point making this Court

627
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,280
practical and the other thing is that I

628
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,139
beat tell everyone is and I'm sure this

629
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,030
is this is a problem with education in

630
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,300
general just doing the classroom look is

631
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,680
not good enough and I think the main

632
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,570
thing that we're actually driving these

633
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,520
students towards is into the community

634
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,800
so for all of you are here today and

635
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,510
you're all at hope because you know you

636
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,190
want to be involved with each other you

637
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,390
want to meet each other and for the

638
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,400
students a lot of them this is their

639
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,100
first time being exposed to the

640
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,020
information security community so a lot

641
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,030
of them came back from events like at

642
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,860
b-sides or they go to Brooklyn Klein or

643
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,690
they actually go tour in office like

644
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,870
from Black Duck software or elsewhere in

645
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,980
the Boston area and see some of this

646
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,959
professionals who work there and they

647
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,840
come back really rejuvenated and

648
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,790
energized about this field so it was

649
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,169
that practical experience of taking what

650
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,540
they've learned and putting in these pep

651
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,640
talks and getting in front of their

652
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,649
fellow students as well like what ming

653
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,610
and i are doing and giving a talk on you

654
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,650
know what they're passionate about

655
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,020
that's was the real take away so

656
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,150
actually two quick things well a little

657
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,100
bit just on on the side note here I saw

658
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,660
like I would I got in yesterday I hope

659
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,250
and I saw that there was like I see some

660
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,780
school had a feel it was feeling like

661
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,850
wait some school have a field trip here

662
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,500
at Hope and it sure think we're John st.

663
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,419
John's that that's that brought like a

664
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,670
whole crew here at or that really damn

665
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,680
cool a really really cool and I always

666
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,790
remind students that Warner my for you

667
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,410
didn't call it I didn't learn a damn

668
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,120
thing about this I didn't even know the

669
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,130
cybersecurity thing even exist in it I

670
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,989
went to USENIX annual conference in 2004

671
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,300
so after all these experience what did

672
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,680
we actually learn so here are some of

673
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,169
release notes that we have will go

674
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,640
through features bugs other things as

675
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,340
well that we took from this experience

676
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,650
so what did we think we did with this

677
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,159
course one is I think as best as we

678
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,330
could

679
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,310
addressed a lot of diversity

680
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,949
shortcomings that we're seeing in this

681
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,080
field you know whether it be from

682
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,140
educational background from gender mix

683
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,250
in the actual work of cybersecurity I

684
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,260
think we did a pretty good job of

685
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,750
getting the students mixed and creating

686
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,550
those bridges there the timing was

687
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,440
actually pretty helpful because it was a

688
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,780
high demand course students of course

689
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,580
see everything in the daily news right

690
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,680
now related to cybersecurity whether it

691
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,360
be a breach or an election his system

692
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,660
hack you know students from all

693
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,010
different background

694
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,660
they're really interested in this topic

695
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,060
now so that really helped us out and

696
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,350
then lastly you know I think we really

697
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,610
planted the seeds with some of our

698
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,230
students and we'll show some of the

699
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,780
results later on we also have some of

700
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,940
the students here today so I think you

701
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,860
know we actually succeeded in you know

702
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,030
getting you know an actual glide path

703
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,540
for some of these students into the

704
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:50,110
field so I think we have some pretty we

705
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,129
should be pretty proud of that that bugs

706
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,590
some things that we learned that we

707
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:59,870
could have we gotta do better on the

708
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:01,520
next time one of the biggest comments

709
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,679
from students was they wanted more come

710
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,370
more talk do more talking more

711
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,440
collaboration more debates there was

712
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,270
some a lot of comments like you know

713
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,740
from especially from the cs students

714
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,940
like when the world of rule 41 one of

715
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,950
the things that we're considering for

716
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,510
the next reiteration is to have both the

717
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,120
both sets of students who do like quick

718
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,129
two-minute videos on on a particular

719
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,090
conflict on teaching the other side of

720
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:35,810
the aisle on a particular concept so for

721
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:39,110
example a good one for computer science

722
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:42,409
students is what is tcp/ip or how does a

723
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,540
web work simple videos like that or the

724
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,570
real basics of a I'm gonna pull

725
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,850
something else on a policy and yeah I

726
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,740
mean basic you know for instance how

727
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,629
does an election system work I think

728
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,670
it's a pretty popular topic nowadays so

729
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,870
how does civic engagement work so having

730
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,070
a student from the political science

731
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,709
department talked about different ways

732
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,149
in which voting happens around the world

733
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,550
that would be I think a pretty pertinent

734
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,790
topic for some cross across development

735
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:10,580
teaching yeah classroom environment this

736
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,649
is not only an issue with cough I think

737
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,659
there's a more broader more general and

738
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,280
a more global problem is you take a look

739
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,620
at most classroom these days they're

740
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,310
still very much like the seat and desk

741
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:26,270
like like this kind of style in which

742
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:29,720
and it's not like an open lab for you

743
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,960
know team-based team-based learning for

744
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,120
doing project and

745
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,740
the room wasn't set up like that we do

746
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,040
have some spaces now a tough set

747
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,510
actually I like that and again more more

748
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,809
class debates

749
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,640
you know because debates are healthy but

750
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,010
if you don't understand both sides of

751
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,480
the both sides the pros and cons and the

752
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,930
trade-off you don't really understand a

753
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,250
full issue some or some of the smaller

754
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,100
issues that we encountered while

755
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,200
conducting the course you know the

756
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,969
academic system at a lot of higher

757
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,700
educational universities is still based

758
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,460
off of a pretty set thirteen weeks for a

759
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,929
semester so the best we could really do

760
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,480
is lay the groundwork on a lot of issues

761
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:11,920
so we're not expecting our students to

762
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,809
know everything when they get out what

763
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,940
we're expecting is to get them involved

764
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,290
in the community so that it we give them

765
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,500
a good foundation so that they can

766
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,690
continue to engage and participate we

767
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,700
also you know taught in Boston

768
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,590
Massachusetts and we actually taught in

769
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,510
the beginning of the winter so of course

770
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,309
the weather and getting people from the

771
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,679
community to come there's always going

772
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:34,899
to be hiccups around that we have to

773
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,280
reschedule some TTFN games some guest

774
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,780
speakers have to miss but you know

775
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,780
that's just the nature of teaching and a

776
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:43,059
really cold Northern University and then

777
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,190
lastly the interesting thing I don't

778
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,090
know if this is necessarily an issue but

779
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,100
it's definitely something if you're

780
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,070
teaching these courses that you have to

781
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,110
keep in mind in that the cyber security

782
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,809
field is really dynamic so we'd be a

783
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,250
sitting in in classes and you know maybe

784
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,960
Jeff would be teaching one day or I

785
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,160
would be standing up in the middle of

786
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,170
the room and Ming would be you know

787
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,850
rifling through Twitter and something

788
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,970
would change fundamentally in

789
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,250
cybersecurity like sha-1 was broken in

790
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,900
February 2017 oh it was during the

791
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,210
middle of class that that happened to

792
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:17,110
also the timing condition now it'll work

793
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:19,030
against us as well too because I think

794
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,939
it was like two one or two weeks after

795
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:24,070
the court wrote over wanna cry happen

796
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,710
yeah so I mean you have to be on your

797
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,120
feet like the syllabus and the

798
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,940
pre-planning that you do for these

799
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,290
courses that higher education

800
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,300
traditionally does you have to be able

801
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,970
to kind of think on your feet and

802
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,710
innovate because like I said the the

803
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,570
issues are changing so some things that

804
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,690
we had in the syllabus at the original

805
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,970
portion of front end of it we have

806
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:48,720
change and and vice versa so you know

807
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:51,750
flexibility was pretty key so some

808
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,610
further lessons learned vocabulary is an

809
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,770
issue all of you know this in the

810
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:58,050
information security fields how we name

811
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,940
threat actors or how we name you know

812
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,220
actual viruses how we name different

813
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,590
terminology the acronyms that we use

814
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,240
it's always an issue and there's not

815
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,010
even agreement within the cyber security

816
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,660
field and then when you get to political

817
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,820
science and the international relations

818
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,580
field with their own acronyms with their

819
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,200
own terms they have their own language

820
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,060
so really in this course we needed to

821
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,560
make sure that both sides understood

822
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,300
what we meant when we said certain

823
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,179
things so here's a real good example

824
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:26,629
even the most basic stuff how many

825
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,740
people have a problem with the width

826
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,650
okay okay

827
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,740
whoo he'll have a problem with the comm

828
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,930
the word cyber like who has a who has a

829
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,140
problem okay

830
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:42,780
so for those of you like that like you

831
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,030
haven't it's like cyber is put in it's

832
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:49,379
tagged into everything now cyber Pearl

833
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:54,840
Harbor okay we hear that as well - yeah

834
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:57,060
cyber 9/11 and I know especially with

835
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,010
some communities out there they call it

836
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,320
InfoSec instead but is that really the

837
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,460
best term but on the flip side of things

838
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,620
if you do this for the Fed if you do

839
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,110
this on the government side they all use

840
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,209
cyber security and in a more pickier

841
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:13,620
part it's a cyber security one word or

842
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:17,130
cyber security - words you'll be the

843
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,870
judge and the other surprise is you know

844
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,820
from the non-technical students they

845
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,040
wanted more technical content when we

846
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,510
actually had the survey come back a lot

847
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,580
of their responses were we want more

848
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,010
technicals and so you know next time -

849
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,929
surprise - I think that really surprised

850
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,220
that I don't know what it was and what

851
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,260
one of the things of course I can't have

852
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,120
until the bug by this is it because a

853
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,340
lot of students are afraid they never

854
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,929
had the foundation I know a tough

855
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,070
morning many people who okay got intro

856
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,350
to computer science but they didn't

857
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,179
never have taken intro ever before from

858
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:49,379
like high school or elementary for a

859
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,300
k-12 level I don't know that was really

860
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,210
really shocking to me is that it was a

861
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,370
huge demand from the non time

862
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,929
I political - we want more technical

863
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,629
like we want to know more about the tech

864
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:02,240
side of things oh and then the last

865
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,529
thing I think just in our courses we

866
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,570
would highlight much like we've done in

867
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:06,919
this presentation you know different

868
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,990
people from the community and what

869
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,980
they've said and I think for a lot of

870
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,480
our students they come from all

871
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,909
different backgrounds alternative

872
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,730
backgrounds whatever path they've been

873
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:18,200
on to information security but just

874
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,429
showing them you know particular role

875
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,559
models that are out there what they've

876
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,000
done and what they've said just to show

877
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,289
that there are actually people out there

878
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,230
that when they exit the class they can

879
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:29,990
continue to learn from and then also

880
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,610
saying you know what path Iran is is not

881
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,960
necessarily there everyone comes from

882
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,168
different weird castes there was a

883
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,419
really good Twitter thread last March

884
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,520
around my weird path to InfoSec maybe

885
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:42,350
some of you participated in it but you

886
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,799
know just a diversity of how people get

887
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,789
into this field I think is kind of

888
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,529
encouraging to a lot of folks who may

889
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,480
think they're new or may have impostor

890
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,830
syndrome that you know we can all get

891
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,330
into this field and all have something

892
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,340
unique to contribute as long as we have

893
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,809
a passion for it so mention a little bit

894
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,510
more about that and when we talk about

895
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:03,080
the results so what are we going to do

896
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:05,658
next time so every computer science

897
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:10,040
program now is jumping on the ethics

898
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:11,480
bandwagon also are surprising that a lot

899
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,699
not a lot of computer science programs

900
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,349
are not jumping on BET the basic civics

901
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,428
being way actually are starting to

902
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,260
happen well with all the election

903
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,330
security stuff there now it's actually

904
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,659
good to see but I can tell you in fall

905
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,339
of 2019 we will be offering a course

906
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,220
called computer science for future

907
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,918
presidents now this is not meant to be a

908
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:34,730
course to train you know to short that

909
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,429
to make non-technical political science

910
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,210
international relations students into

911
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,560
computer science that's not the goal of

912
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:44,359
the course but is to address that

913
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,830
shortcoming as I we just mentioned about

914
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:51,020
non technical students want more of the

915
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,339
technical content and want to give a

916
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,139
shout out and thanks to the Hewlett

917
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:56,540
Foundation for their support for making

918
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,670
this course happen and this course will

919
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,960
be one it's a joint course between

920
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,170
computer science and the Fletcher School

921
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,660
of Law and Diplomacy and so you may be

922
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,630
curious I'm actually in the

923
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:11,109
lighting labs for this course right now

924
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:13,540
is working with Susan Landau on building

925
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:16,450
this course and the topics that were

926
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:20,740
going to have are going to be include

927
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:23,049
like how the internet works cloud and

928
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,120
how internet work how the web work cloud

929
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:29,590
and IOT privacy and security

930
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,799
cryptography and things like machine

931
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,870
learning and fairness and blockchain

932
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
isn't really worth it or is it really

933
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,630
high like what's what worth it what's

934
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,890
hype and it's gonna be you know they're

935
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,100
gonna have the lab is gonna be all

936
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,060
hands-on you know there's no program but

937
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,110
you're gonna do things like cripple

938
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,880
challenges you know shouldn't say this

939
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:54,900
to to lab I guess I'll say it right now

940
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,610
is that I already put to get like hashes

941
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:01,390
like LinkedIn brick like LinkedIn breach

942
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:04,860
passwords right understand things like

943
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:08,920
the 1998 hamat the five nine concept and

944
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:10,750
cloud so what did this actually lend

945
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,130
itself in terms of results from the

946
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,410
chorus and we actually had some pretty

947
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,960
good results even you know just towards

948
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,830
the end of the the course itself so a

949
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,230
couple of our students actually

950
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:23,290
participated in a Belfer event up at

951
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,630
Harvard and here they are two of our

952
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,610
students under the defending Digital

953
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,700
democracy kind of hackathon civic

954
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,950
hackathon and looking at some of the you

955
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,080
know misinformation and disinformation

956
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,120
problem set up there there between them

957
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,390
is a guy you might be familiar with his

958
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,930
former Secretary of Defense ash Carter

959
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,779
under Obama

960
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,160
he was the SEC def at the Pentagon and

961
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,280
the two students actually took on the

962
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,080
grand prize of $10,000 for an app that

963
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,660
they developed called sanity check to

964
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,880
look into how they could leverage

965
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,859
natural language processing and you know

966
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,480
bot detection source great listing all

967
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,670
those sorts of things to really get in

968
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,190
combat against the misinformation

969
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:06,910
problem that we've seen a lot recently

970
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,560
and within the 2016 election so actually

971
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,240
applying some of the policy issues that

972
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,430
they were seeing some of the technical

973
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,379
skills that they had this is actually a

974
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,350
group

975
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,720
of two excellent excellent young female

976
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,720
professionals now in the field

977
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,950
shout out about Gabby Ron cone and when

978
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,870
order to Sean Bray I mention our a

979
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,460
little bit next and you know just taking

980
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,710
what they've learned and really applying

981
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,110
it to to a real big problem set in the

982
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,820
Civic space and then as well the other

983
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,860
thing I really want to give a huge shout

984
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,980
out to and it's kind of like the the

985
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,230
mock trial or the bait Club of the 21st

986
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,900
century and that is the cyber 912

987
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,970
competitions that are occurring here in

988
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,920
New York there's one in November up at

989
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,870
Columbia University run by J helium the

990
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,330
digital cyber group up there but there's

991
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:54,259
also a national one down in the DC in

992
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,920
mid-march where students get together

993
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,660
coming from all different backgrounds

994
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,580
whether it be legal backgrounds whether

995
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,470
it be policy backgrounds whether it be

996
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,910
computer science backgrounds and they

997
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,299
come together and they're confronting a

998
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,310
particular situation within you know a

999
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,050
public security situation international

1000
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,540
security situation and they have to go

1001
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:15,000
in front of like we had in the course a

1002
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,620
policy maker to really advise what

1003
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,900
should I be doing at this course of us

1004
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,640
in this part of a particular event and

1005
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,830
getting in front of judges like you see

1006
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,660
in this picture and do performing their

1007
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,460
recommendations for really senior

1008
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,410
policymakers and a lot of these events

1009
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,360
as well as practitioners in the field

1010
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,799
and it really gets students you know up

1011
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,590
there like we are doing here today and

1012
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,310
communicating out the issues in a six

1013
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,780
succinct as well as in a understandable

1014
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,130
fashion what is going on in

1015
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,020
cybersecurity and how it's really

1016
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,330
affecting the public so our students

1017
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,340
actually went down to DC and took the

1018
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,990
crown of you know best public speaking

1019
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,820
performance down there they went to the

1020
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,529
semi-finals as an undergraduate group

1021
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,570
which is quite impressive given that a

1022
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,130
lot of the top schools coming from the

1023
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,860
military as well as Brad school

1024
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,240
community so yeah we're really quite

1025
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,830
proud and it actually takes a lot of

1026
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,350
preparations so students are preparing

1027
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,790
at least a month you know to two times

1028
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,799
three times a week getting together for

1029
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,390
hours on end actually going through the

1030
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,720
scenario and planning out how they're

1031
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,910
gonna brief the policymakers yeah and so

1032
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,439
you may be curious where did the

1033
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,990
students you know to forty-something

1034
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,740
shoes I end up going and I can tell you

1035
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:24,629
right now weather or computers both

1036
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,189
computer science and political sign to

1037
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,390
good no

1038
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,380
the student ended up doing something

1039
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:32,629
cybersecurity related

1040
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,940
3/4 of them went to mitre 1/3 of them I

1041
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:38,390
know all of them are there now one's an

1042
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:42,109
intern three of them full-time one's a

1043
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,549
business analyst at clutch i/o we have

1044
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:44,900
thread Intel analysts so actually

1045
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:46,788
someone actually transcending the

1046
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,349
boundaries of strategic threat

1047
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:51,020
intelligence as well as the technical

1048
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:52,579
side of intelligence again unicorn but

1049
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,900
you know these are the kinds of people

1050
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:55,430
were trying to turn out people who

1051
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,230
understand both the policy as well as

1052
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,558
the global dynamics and we went to fire

1053
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:02,180
i1 nan the one non-technical one on

1054
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,309
computer science student went to want to

1055
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,690
fire I and and they're they're actually

1056
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,220
grappling with a lot of the issues that

1057
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,500
we're bringing up in these courses like

1058
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,788
how do I analyze what's going on out

1059
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,440
there in the world and bring it back to

1060
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:15,020
the technical side and what's developing

1061
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,030
so I want to mention winner nerd asam

1062
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,950
brain so what she does she's that

1063
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,440
recorded future now but she did

1064
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,288
something really really cool and she

1065
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,460
wrote a piece on threat threat analysis

1066
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:34,670
insights available but what she did was

1067
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:36,380
she wrote a piece on how she got her you

1068
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,500
know how she got her position and how

1069
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,299
how was made possible by not only her

1070
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,849
studies in computer science but also in

1071
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:46,400
international relations and that was

1072
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:48,289
really good for a reason because I see

1073
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,910
this in Matt I know you you did this

1074
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:52,270
with computer with what political

1075
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,828
science and is a lot of the student

1076
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:57,680
actually in but even in computer science

1077
00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:00,049
do they everyone have such a narrow mind

1078
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,940
of career option I mean computer science

1079
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:04,029
students nationwide they say oh I won't

1080
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,349
Google Microsoft Facebook and Apple I

1081
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,609
our international relations and

1082
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,630
political science students they they

1083
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:12,558
think about all going into government

1084
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:15,799
but those opportunities are far few in

1085
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:18,049
between these days and we're Nonna wrote

1086
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:20,210
a piece you know you do this a lot more

1087
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:21,740
than just a usual suspect of thing so

1088
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,480
you can do things like threat Intel that

1089
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,299
were you can use actually both are both

1090
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,460
are both world and then I mean we've

1091
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:30,529
actually got our students contributing

1092
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,720
to how we as a federal government how he

1093
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:34,190
is an international community actually

1094
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,029
organized around this effort because

1095
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,650
there seems to be a lot of

1096
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:38,670
disorganization out there and what does

1097
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,200
the government's role was a private SEC

1098
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,240
so we have students actually going out

1099
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,519
to think tanks now into other places and

1100
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,399
actually making their mark in the policy

1101
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,470
field as well as in the technical fields

1102
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,730
blessed I kind of want to wrap up now

1103
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,519
because we're getting close to the end

1104
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,380
just giving some shoutouts to some some

1105
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,450
really important people that have helped

1106
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,119
us throughout the course as we mentioned

1107
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,890
Geoffrey Taliaferro who if we could be

1108
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,119
here like we definitely give him a lot

1109
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,480
of the stage as well from his

1110
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,500
perspective but Susan Landau as well at

1111
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,319
Tufts University

1112
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,880
amazing amazing talent in the security

1113
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,859
privacy debate that you should

1114
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,349
definitely read her works on Michelle

1115
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,509
modesty my former adviser up at the

1116
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:20,730
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy

1117
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:22,920
made a huge mark on how we teach at the

1118
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:26,160
graduate level cyber security and cyber

1119
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,230
conflict as well as you know both

1120
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,288
Kathleen Fisher we've been not only bit

1121
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,150
cheap and not for fantastic fantastic a

1122
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:35,099
scared computer science but very very

1123
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,440
very supportive of all the cybersecurity

1124
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,849
initiatives that we've been doing speak

1125
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,369
the world what I speak the world working

1126
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:44,099
with them and you know we also have to

1127
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:45,839
thank our our funders so we got some

1128
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:47,910
funding and support through the Tufts

1129
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,558
innovate grant they underwrote the

1130
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,649
course development as well as the

1131
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,089
execution we also had some critically

1132
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,029
important people who came in and spoke

1133
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:59,339
Kate Crawford

1134
00:42:56,029 --> 00:43:03,150
you know what the ACLU in Boston Eli

1135
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:06,058
Cohn at school gave a guest lecture this

1136
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:11,519
was before I school got acquired by by

1137
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:15,539
Amazon and a system set Milstein at you

1138
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:18,000
know he he says works around the area

1139
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:19,230
but he can't make it I asked him have

1140
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,869
you gonna be around and he said I

1141
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,940
actually not gonna be around but again

1142
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,710
he's in spirit we can't thank him enough

1143
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,079
and each of these people like I said

1144
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,089
getting in front of these kinds of

1145
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,200
students telling about your experience

1146
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,369
of how you were in the field and what

1147
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,990
you do in the field was particularly

1148
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,789
helpful so we really like to thank them

1149
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,828
for for kind of sharing their experience

1150
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:39,809
as well as we shouted out to a lot of

1151
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:41,759
colleagues during this from across

1152
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:43,230
academia but again there are a lot of

1153
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:45,480
great programs out there that a lot of

1154
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,009
budding programs so if you all out in

1155
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,000
the audience can get involved and help

1156
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:50,670
your local universe

1157
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,530
see you know advertise yourself whether

1158
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,230
it be to help students or to come in and

1159
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,600
speak or to participate in a cyber 912

1160
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,130
or CTF or what have you you know we

1161
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,430
really encourage you out there to get

1162
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,160
involved because there's negative

1163
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:07,319
unemployment in the cyber security field

1164
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,160
there is a need for radical inclusion to

1165
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,680
get people from all different

1166
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,259
backgrounds to become involved in this

1167
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,330
field we tend to have gender imbalance

1168
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,460
now we have a background in balance now

1169
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,290
when we need to build bridges so like I

1170
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,580
said the charge is for all of you to get

1171
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,070
involved in raising the next generation

1172
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,049
we saw it earlier here amongst the

1173
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,340
younger set and now I'm telling you in

1174
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,860
the older set they also need your

1175
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:36,740
support as well so I'll open up for any

1176
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:39,240
questions thank you question please I

1177
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,370
guess a great talk you mentioned a

1178
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,390
little bit about how the teaching spaces

1179
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,890
that you were working in weren't

1180
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,140
necessarily the best for what you were

1181
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,690
doing I was wondering if some of the

1182
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,450
pedagogy that you came into the came

1183
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,670
into the course with also needed to kind

1184
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,759
of adapt and improvise and you know if

1185
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:59,880
what what would you use now that you

1186
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,830
know what you know now so I think that

1187
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,320
on the pedagogy side you know like I

1188
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,819
said getting rid of the kind of syllabus

1189
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,010
model and really testing out the

1190
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,180
students and you know changing the way

1191
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,550
they interact with each other in the

1192
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,710
class on this physical infrastructure in

1193
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,690
space side you know really building out

1194
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,400
if you go into the cyber security world

1195
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,590
now a lot of these teams are in open

1196
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,060
floor space kind of offices and they're

1197
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,410
working across different functions

1198
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,960
within the cyber security whether we a

1199
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,609
fusion center or a sock so really

1200
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,560
getting them to kind of gel together so

1201
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,240
I think from a pedagogy standpoint

1202
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,890
getting away from the old model taking a

1203
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,479
new model with student experiences and

1204
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,129
then changing up how the infrastructure

1205
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,740
is I think is the next step yeah and

1206
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,140
that everyone has to wear the same hat

1207
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:42,120
you know in learning and if you saw from

1208
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,819
the previous presenters talk I'm sorry

1209
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,490
but though those days are over

1210
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,170
doesn't work anymore next question so

1211
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm currently a student at Towson

1212
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:54,630
University in Maryland we have a pretty

1213
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,089
decent cyber where Towson Towson um

1214
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,430
great school I know our ethics class is

1215
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:01,500
pretty much universally hated

1216
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:04,770
and I want to know like how did you make

1217
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,570
it exciting for the technical people I

1218
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,890
think you really have to show how it

1219
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,080
applies to what's going on in the real

1220
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,279
world like you have to bring up you

1221
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,590
don't have in business school in law

1222
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,180
school like case examples like really

1223
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,220
into the syllabus selection and the

1224
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,319
content you know actually brought in the

1225
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,990
cases of you know why this is relevant

1226
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,180
and important I mean you just get it

1227
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,609
right now the biggest problem I see is

1228
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,470
the lack of connection between the what

1229
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,730
your look and I see this all the time is

1230
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,009
okay you're learning the stuff in the

1231
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,720
classroom and by the way a lot of

1232
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,730
examples are stolen from like other

1233
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,490
things like for executive the ethics

1234
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,410
example the usually have you for hurdle

1235
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,330
that true all the example like if you

1236
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,950
had to if you have an automated car like

1237
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,990
who would you what would you do would

1238
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,730
you like to run over the people or XY

1239
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:55,020
and Z like if you've heard of that

1240
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:57,900
example it's like thank you we have

1241
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,460
three minutes so this is a great talk I

1242
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,170
did not expect you to intersect so

1243
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,180
closely with my work and I was very

1244
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,920
pleased that it did I'm a software

1245
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,899
engineer that advises the federal

1246
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,850
government on modernizing their internal

1247
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,550
network security policy which is

1248
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,990
terrible for the record and the biggest

1249
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,840
problem that I have is not the

1250
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:18,029
non-technical people it is the policy

1251
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,490
people that started off as engineers it

1252
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,130
made the jump like 30 20 30 years ago to

1253
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,560
policy and do not realize that their

1254
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:29,100
understanding of trade-offs and threats

1255
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:31,290
are out of date so I have a question

1256
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,900
about your rules with the

1257
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,820
capture-the-flag teams and the the

1258
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,870
diversity of the way you constructed

1259
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,570
teams which I thought were very

1260
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:42,690
interesting but I was wondering how do

1261
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:44,700
you feel the students process to the

1262
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,170
those set of rules do they understand

1263
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,629
that they were building stronger teams

1264
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,920
by having a diverse group of people or

1265
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,790
do you think that if you hadn't had

1266
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,410
those rules they would have just

1267
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,370
fragmented themselves and would have

1268
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,810
thought this is great we produce

1269
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,150
high-quality work and they'll let you

1270
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,690
take that one course I think it's a good

1271
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,700
question

1272
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,750
I think you know starting out you don't

1273
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,890
really want to tell the students while

1274
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,930
you're putting them through a certain

1275
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,060
way but I think after they themselves

1276
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,419
realize why we put them in certain

1277
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,920
situations and then

1278
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,420
arrangements like they did and why we

1279
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,210
ask them certain things we would explain

1280
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:18,790
to him after why Iran yeah I don't read

1281
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:20,410
sometimes especially in if the trade off

1282
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,740
what I mean again it's a trade off

1283
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,509
problem if you bring this up if let's

1284
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,430
say if I brought that topic up why how

1285
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,010
we create the team so everyone is that's

1286
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,169
gonna be and everyone bring and that

1287
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,490
could ratchet even raise even more

1288
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,839
question that's not related to CTF game

1289
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,359
so that could even raise even more

1290
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,970
questions so what we decide to okay here

1291
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:44,470
it is ask questions later I felt that

1292
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,450
was a my a was a trade-off that we had

1293
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:49,118
to make we can squeeze in one more

1294
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:51,520
question okay I originally had to I'm

1295
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,000
making real fast did you discuss the

1296
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,130
Google versus Oracle Java case at all

1297
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,690
and how the judge taught himself to

1298
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,609
engineering and now it has been

1299
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,819
overruled and the other is do you plan

1300
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:05,440
to put this on chrisarah or OCW so

1301
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:07,150
people have the lectures and not just

1302
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,349
the github we didn't bring up the first

1303
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:14,440
case but that's a good suggestion for

1304
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:15,329
the next one and in terms of OCW open

1305
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,190
courseware

1306
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:19,599
here so one problem like my secure my

1307
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,470
main security course is open it's all

1308
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:27,849
open as our open source opens online but

1309
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:31,569
this some schools that are very leery

1310
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:34,150
about this online model still I believe

1311
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:36,009
it at that I mean I'll Lee I put that a

1312
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:38,470
nice way there's some schools like cuff

1313
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:40,420
they haven't made the full investment at

1314
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,220
schools like MIT and Stanford have my

1315
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,780
quick parting comment is this kind of

1316
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,549
course succeeds because the students are

1317
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,530
next to each other so you can't

1318
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,700
necessarily put it online you need to

1319
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:50,349
have the students interact with each

1320
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,200
other and I think that's where maybe

1321
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:54,910
higher education still survives is that

1322
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,770
you can put students together in the

1323
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,270
same space to crack the same problems

1324
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,609
and I think that's probably the value

1325
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,740
add for a higher education system that

1326
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:05,049
you can debate the value of right now

1327
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,578
but the basic question the basic videos

1328
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,319
like a short tutorial right

1329
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:11,500
yeah those can be Jess definitely can be

1330
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,850
online that can scale thank you so much

1331
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,210
yeah we'll be here for more question

1332
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:18,920
