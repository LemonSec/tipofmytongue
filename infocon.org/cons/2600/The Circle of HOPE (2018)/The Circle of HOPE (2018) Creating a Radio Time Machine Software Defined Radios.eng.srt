00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:08,069
Thomas Witherspoon is the executive

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,440
director of a remarkable nonprofit

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,870
organization called ears to our world

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:22,198
their website is eto W calm ETA calm and

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:24,900
they provide very low cost radios am/fm

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,080
shortwave receivers to impoverished

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,580
villages that have nothing we're talking

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,269
dirt poor villages with no electricity

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,430
no infrastructure of any kind whatsoever

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,070
so that the school in these villages can

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,239
have some source of information about

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,329
healthcare and other really vital

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:48,559
information so that's admirable in

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:55,140
itself but he has spearheaded a project

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:57,780
to archive radio programming in a way

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,789
that is kind of a mind-bending

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,820
trip and trying to figure out and trip

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,909
in more than one ways you want to record

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,350
like entire spectrum in context so I'll

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,150
let him explain how it works but it's a

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,640
really fascinating project that you can

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,850
all afford to participate in for just a

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,780
few dollars and really create a an

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,780
amazing radio time machine Thomas

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:30,679
thank you for that nice introduction

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:33,590
Bernie I really appreciate that so thank

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,340
you this is my first hope it won't be my

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,770
last hope I don't think I'm cool enough

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,900
to be up here but this is such a

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,810
fascinating conference I know I'll be

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,290
back

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,750
last year I was invited to speak at the

33
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,180
radio preservation task force meeting in

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,250
Washington DC at the Library of Congress

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,120
and it was a really big honor for me

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,140
because it gave me an opportunity to

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,640
talk about something that's near and

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,340
dear to my heart which is the

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,800
preservation of radio spectrum and here

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,860
I am with my federal panelists and the

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,750
moderator they are that was like my

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,190
fifth or sixth selfie I've ever taken in

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,900
my life

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,210
there's no instagramming here as you can

45
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,390
tell but I was really proud of that

46
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,970
moment and in that group of archivists

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,160
this is a who's who of archivists in the

48
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,660
world academics and people working for

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,170
the Library of Congress National

50
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,200
Archives the Smithsonian it was an

51
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,839
intimidating crowd but I asked them how

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,410
many people know what a radio spectrum

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,630
recording is and out of probably 150

54
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,540
people in the room only one raised their

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:52,070
hand and it was David Goren who did the

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,850
pirate radio presentation last yesterday

57
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,720
and he's also on our team for archiving

58
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,370
spectrum so it didn't really count and

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,020
to demonstrate what a radio spectrum

60
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,030
recording is I'm actually going to do

61
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,590
this for you as well I would ask you to

62
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,250
raise your hands but I can't see anyone

63
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,300
up here I just see a bunch of lights so

64
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,830
what you're looking at if you're not

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,110
familiar with a software-defined radio

66
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,560
this is actually a radio right here it's

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,260
just a software interface to a piece of

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,989
to a piece of hardware a radio at the

69
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,989
top you see a waterfall display right

70
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,880
below that you see a spectrum display

71
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,040
the spectrum display shows live signals

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,549
and what you're looking at is the entire

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,609
AM broadcast band right like on the AM

74
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,950
radio on your

75
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,040
car radio or whatever each one of those

76
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,690
Peaks is a signal and right above it in

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,900
the waterfall display that shows you how

78
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,460
those signals change over time so the

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,800
brighter colors mean it's stronger

80
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,380
signals and and you can see this when I

81
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,210
when I start the recording below it

82
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,829
there's some audio information there's a

83
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,330
frequency display and a few other

84
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,760
controls that are really common on

85
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,560
software-defined radio applications I'll

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,980
go ahead and play this now I will note

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,980
this is basically an off air recording

88
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,500
so it's not super hi-fi or anything like

89
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,119
that and I also narrate this recording

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,709
so you'll hear me talk over it I'm going

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,149
to start it so what you're listening to

92
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,470
is actually the AM broadcast band

93
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:27,719
recorded in Providence Rhode Island

94
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:31,970
May 1st 1986 starting around 759 UTC

95
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,170
which is roughly around 4 o'clock a.m.

96
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,670
so the news is about to start at the top

97
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,759
of the hour

98
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,759

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,870
liken himself says even with the vast

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,360
resources available to the United States

102
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,919
there is no way of knowing just how bad

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,830
the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster

104
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,659
really is the accident is the talk of

105
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,330
the Western world there are still vast

106
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:06,120
portions of the Soviet Union and have no

107
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,068
idea that anything is wrong your new bar

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,750
with Stanford University says the only

109
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:21,360
people in the Soviet Union who was told

110
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:24,900
about anything connected to a nuclear

111
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,419
accident people don't know anything

112
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,520
about the prior event you still be

113
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,299
running out of control if I have

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,250
expected the second reactor a plant so

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,590
it's not just one recording that we have

116
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,360
here not just at this one broadcaster

117
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:45,239
but everything that was on the am

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,719
broadcast ban that day so I'll just tune

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,000
to it

120
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:54,300
like as if I were tuning live radio

I think you get the idea okay now here's

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,090
the interesting thing

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,370
this was done in 1986 I didn't do it so

142
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,179
it was made by a radio dax-ur these are

143
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,280
these are people who they were not their

144
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,380
goal here was not to record an important

145
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,929
news day or anything like this this was

146
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,030
just a normal day for them they were

147
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,350
looking for distant stations and what

148
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,780
they would do was they discovered that

149
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,640
if you use a high-five ECR and you

150
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,159
connect it to the if' of your receiver

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,590
you can actually record the analog

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
signal coming in off the antenna and the

153
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,489
high-five VCR had enough bandwidth that

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,590
you could record the bulk of the a.m.

155
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,510
broadcast band all at once they would

156
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,799
then take that tape rewind it play it

157
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,680
back through the antenna port of their

158
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,150
receiver and tune do it as if it were

159
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
live radio so they could get all the

160
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,830
station's they missed at the top of the

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,410
hour so this wasn't recorded because of

162
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,419
the Challenger incident or Chernobyl or

163
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:05,730
anything like that it was just a regular

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:08,430
day in Rhode Island for radio dax-ur so

165
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:11,580
I know a thing or two about radio I run

166
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,570
a website called the SW ailing post SW

167
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,300
SW l stands for shortwave listening and

168
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,430
I we have about anywhere from four

169
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,310
thousand to seven thousand daily readers

170
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,990
and who knew there were that many

171
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,020
shortwave radio listeners in the world

172
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,910
but I'm in the middle of a lot of

173
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,320
communications between radio enthusiasts

174
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,090
talking about equipment talking about

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,569
things going on in the world and I also

176
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,630
evaluate alpha and beta test and then

177
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,990
review a lot of radio equipment so I

178
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,450
spend a lot of time with radio hardware

179
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:49,500
also I'm not new to time travel I'm an

180
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,060
archivist at heart and in 2012 I created

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,690
a website called the shortwave radio

182
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,859
audio archive and it was in response to

183
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:01,230
I'm very well connected with the radio

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,520
enthusiast community and a lot of radio

185
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,190
enthusiasts back in the day would make

186
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,689
off-air recordings of shortwave radio

187
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,030
broadcasts so they would just literally

188
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,720
set a recorder in front of their radio

189
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,250
turn it on

190
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,170
and record what was coming out of the

191
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,550
speaker or had a direct line in

192
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,060
connection or something and they still

193
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,400
do it today so we have recordings dating

194
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,359
from just last month to back to like the

195
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,660
1950s hundreds of off-air recordings

196
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,520
curated in this library and it's totally

197
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,170
free I find this completely out of my

198
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,150
pocket we have no advertisers no

199
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,219
sponsors no nothing and it's available

200
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,470
as a podcasts you can subscribe to it

201
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,970
and download all these recordings one

202
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,700
really interesting thing that happened a

203
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,550
couple years ago I was contacted by the

204
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,890
wire magazine in the UK and they were

205
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,650
just informing me that they were writing

206
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,770
about this website and their magazine

207
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:59,670
because musicians are using it for sound

208
00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:01,050
clips who knew so what is radio right if

209
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,770
you're old enough you may think of it as

210
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,599
a tube top tube tabletop radio if you

211
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,720
were a child of the 70s and 80s you

212
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,800
would have the classic Panasonic RF 2200

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,890
solid-state receiver I love this radio

214
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,449
or maybe you think of a Walkman and more

215
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,460
and more these days if you there are new

216
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,530
radios on the market it tends to be like

217
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,540
an FM radio bluetooth speaker which is

218
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,750
what this radio is right here I reviewed

219
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,380
this a couple months ago and as they

220
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,240
were saying in the previous presentation

221
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,100
where we consume a lot of our

222
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,860
over-the-air radio these days is in the

223
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,750
car and so a lot of us and I'd say

224
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,060
probably a lot of Millennials think only

225
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,660
a radio is maybe what they hear in the

226
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,199
car but a lot of our smartphones also

227
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,240
have FM chips in them by and large I

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,880
think iPhones don't activate them if

229
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,970
they have them in in the iPhone Android

230
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,180
phones some companies don't activate the

231
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,160
chip I have always had Android phones

232
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,989
that did and so you just launch an FM

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,100
radio application plug in your

234
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,120
headphones because it uses your

235
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,940
headphones as the antenna and you can

236
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,339
both team through the FM broadcast band

237
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,570
and you can record it as well and if you

238
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,490
happen to have one of those phones that

239
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,050
doesn't have the chip activated I'm sure

240
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,910
there's some people resourceful enough

241
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,880
to do Google searches and figure out how

242
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,260
to fix that

243
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,300
but radio time travel we need a

244
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,490
different type of radio we need

245
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,079
something a little more robust here we

246
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,820
need a software-defined radio and

247
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,269
probably a lot of you know what these

248
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,670
are but I'll refer to them as SD ours in

249
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,670
this presentation and basically they're

250
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,500
a piece of hardware and software

251
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,540
together so they're less like this radio

252
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,029
and a little bit more like the one that

253
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,160
lives on your on your phone where you

254
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:52,649
have a piece of software that is your

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,890
interface to a piece of radio hardware

256
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:58,200
and radio enthusiasts so in the radio

257
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,000
enthusiasts world I should say SDRs

258
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,470
looks something like this the SDR is a

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,649
little black box that you see up in the

260
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,920
top left corner that usually has an

261
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,649
antenna jack a data port of some sort

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,870
and a power source port or the data and

263
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:16,529
the power and the USB and you just have

264
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,149
two ports an antenna and USB and then

265
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,439
you have a piece of software which is

266
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,540
down at the bottom right which is your

267
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,029
SDR application which is your interface

268
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:30,959
to the SDR I believe very firmly that

269
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:34,170
STRs have had a tremendous impact on how

270
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,130
we view and and what we know about the

271
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,500
radio spectrum around us because instead

272
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,199
of being restricted to seeing just a

273
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,500
little piece of the radio spectrum at a

274
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:48,209
time and and moving a dial through the

275
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,640
bands on your radio and hearing just a

276
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,560
little tiny thin slice all of a sudden

277
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,990
the entire spectrum comes alive and you

278
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,709
can see all of the signals there this is

279
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,540
an SDR application in the 20 meter band

280
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,880
ham radio band and you can see the

281
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,420
spectrum display so all SDR applications

282
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,120
have the same components which is

283
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,709
usually frequency displays and controls

284
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,990
this live spectrum display and then a

285
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,089
waterfall display the waterfall display

286
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,339
allows you to really kind of visualize

287
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,160
everything that's going on in the

288
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:24,350
bandwidth that the swath of frequencies

289
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,199
that you've chosen to view and listen to

290
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,180
but back to the time machine part if you

291
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,640
want to build a time machine you do need

292
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,949
a few components I would bet that most

293
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,740
of you have them now number one you need

294
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:38,770
a computer

295
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,770
number two an SDR application and number

296
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,650
three an SDR the computer can be a

297
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,699
desktop it can be a laptop it can be

298
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,829
running Linux Mac OS especially Windows

299
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,780
most SCR applications are actually

300
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,410
designed around Windows it can be an

301
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:58,120
Android tablet running an Android

302
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,250
application that's an SDR application

303
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,520
and of course even little computers like

304
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,020
the infamous Raspberry Pi there even

305
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,280
disk images that you can load up on

306
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,990
these that already have all the drivers

307
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,760
and everything for software-defined

308
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,260
radios ready to go they have enough

309
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,520
horsepower to fully use an SDR and then

310
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,350
number two you need an S to your

311
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,120
application and the great thing is the

312
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,330
bulk of the really good ones are free

313
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,090
totally free my the three I use the most

314
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,040
are at the top HD SD r SD r sharp an SDR

315
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,530
console you can google those and find

316
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
those very easily very powerful very

317
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,790
robust and what I like about them is

318
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,380
they can control more than one SDR they

319
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,380
work with several different models of

320
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,110
software-defined radios and also there

321
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,760
are ones for Mac and Linux I this isn't

322
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,370
by no means a comprehensive list or a

323
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,930
bunch more I see a lot of development

324
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,190
happening in the Linux world right now

325
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,510
which I really like the Mac world as

326
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,100
well there are some applications

327
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,720
available but again if you really want

328
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,280
to dive in strs there are more options

329
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,540
in the windows market and again they all

330
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,480
kind of look the same this is a more

331
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,240
complicated looking SDR application

332
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,600
this is SDR uno and I'm running it with

333
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,270
the new RSP duo made by SDR play which

334
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,710
is an SDR that has two tuners in it so

335
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,720
you can have two completely independent

336
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,510
tuners so the upper half of the screen

337
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,100
is the FM broadcast band and we were

338
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,890
just talking about Eibach channels i've

339
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,840
actually highlighted an FM audio channel

340
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,030
and next to it you can see the two

341
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,770
digital channels adjacent to it that are

342
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,410
kind of purple looking in that display

343
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,689
in the waterfall display and below that

344
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,459
there's a second instance of the

345
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,560
application running and it's on the

346
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,180
shortwave radio bands so it's covering

347
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,550
these simultaneously within one window

348
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,010
number three you need an SDR and there

349
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,209
is no better time than now to get an SDR

350
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,360
they are

351
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:55,239
and they really span a wide variety of

352
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,329
prices I bet a lot of you already have

353
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,759
an rtl-sdr dongle these are very

354
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,489
inexpensive sdrs that were originally

355
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,879
designed as digital TV tuners the good

356
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,980
plug into your laptop or PC to receive

357
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,509
TV people very quickly realize that they

358
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,089
could hack it and do way way more things

359
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,519
with it you can turn these into scanners

360
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:18,309
you can do radio astronomy with them you

361
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,009
can monitor people's tire pressure

362
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:23,350
sensors on their cars if you want to you

363
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,790
can look at wireless doorbells I mean

364
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,759
just a million different things with

365
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,029
this little device it costs as little as

366
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,589
$10 so if you don't have one just like

367
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,019
skip getting a burger tomorrow at lunch

368
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,749
and get one of these instead the

369
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,059
software is free use SDR sharp and

370
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:41,889
you'll be on the air now if you're like

371
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,329
me and your radio enthusiast you want

372
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,540
something a little more robust than the

373
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:48,998
RTL SDR dongle and this is one of my

374
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,679
favorite STRs right now called the SDR

375
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:55,899
play RSP one a SDR plays a uk-based

376
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,639
company they design and manufacture

377
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,879
these and the United Kingdom and this

378
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,610
cost $100 plus about $20 shipping or

379
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,159
something and they receive everywhere

380
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,669
all the way down to one kilohertz up to

381
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:12,220
two gigahertz so like really really

382
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:15,520
wideband and they have great performance

383
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,380
I I wouldn't have known what to do with

384
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,819
this when I was a kid I would have felt

385
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,500
like I'd you know had command of the

386
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,020
world with this particular receiver and

387
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,189
it's a hundred bucks SDR play makes

388
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,839
other models they're a little more

389
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,480
advanced more in tenha ports that sort

390
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,389
of thing they make the new one with two

391
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:36,220
receivers their top-end

392
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:38,620
SDR I think is 269 dollars or so air spy

393
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,580
makes a they make about three different

394
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,260
STRs and my favorites the HF plus you

395
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,449
can't tell from this image but that has

396
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,140
the footprint of a business card it's

397
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:52,270
very tiny and it's thick it's very dense

398
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,789
and metal as a really nice thick metal

399
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,700
case it has two antenna ports on it and

400
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,300
it only really covers the HF bands and a

401
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,460
little bit of

402
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,260
VHF bands but the part of the HF bands

403
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,330
that covers it's just a phenomenal

404
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,550
receiver I mean incredible performance

405
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,590
and you can pay more the more you pay

406
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,899
for the SDR the better hardware you get

407
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,459
and if you live in an RF dense

408
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,260
environment like an urban area like New

409
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,150
York City you probably want a little bit

410
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,730
better hardware if you're down in the

411
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:22,120
bands that are more prone to noises like

412
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,550
the medium wave and shortwave bands that

413
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,899
was the eel ad FDM s2 which is about

414
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:32,110
$500 this is the micro Tom micro come

415
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,150
perseus which is about $1,000 SDR that's

416
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,810
been around for the better part of a

417
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:40,360
decade now and just for fun I threw this

418
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,010
one and this is the Titan SDR Pro I do

419
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,459
kind of continuous evaluation of this

420
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,370
radio

421
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,030
it's about 2,400 dollars it was

422
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:51,639
originally designed as a does signal

423
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:54,040
intelligence so you can set it up to

424
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,980
monitor 64 frequencies simultaneously

425
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:00,879
and feed the data coming out of that

426
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,100
into decryption programs and that sort

427
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,080
of thing but enthusiasts can buy it too

428
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,300
and you can use it but you rarely need

429
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,669
to listen to 64 channels at once which

430
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,470
is the reason why I believe that most

431
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,830
people can get by with an SDR that cost

432
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,440
about $200 or less the RTL SDR dongle

433
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,919
can do things that that $2400 SDR can't

434
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,150
do this I have it set up actually as an

435
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,880
ad SB receiver receiving the pings off

436
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,290
of aircraft as they pass by and using a

437
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,810
little Raspberry Pi I think that whole

438
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:36,520
set-up cost maybe I don't know $80 or

439
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:37,990
something but again just keep in mind

440
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,790
you need a piece of hardware and a piece

441
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,350
of software so the thing about spectrum

442
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,760
and we're talking about radio spectrum

443
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:51,879
is it's radio in its native format we're

444
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,830
not talking about tuning to a station

445
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,650
and listening to the audio we're talking

446
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,149
about a receiver that can receive

447
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:01,690
simultaneously a swath of frequencies

448
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,100
and all the signals that are in that

449
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,770
radio landscape even the noise

450
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,080
everything that's in it so to me ready

451
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,030
the spectrum recordings equate to radio

452
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,520
time travel as we just took a little

453
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,629
journey ourselves here earlier

454
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,070
and just remember STRs can make spectrum

455
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,260
recordings you need that piece of

456
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,389
hardware to make your own recording but

457
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,670
to listen to them you can just use an

458
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,190
SDR application and someone else's files

459
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,530
so you can do this for free just

460
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,140
download a free SDR application and then

461
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:35,190
get an SDR file and you can do your own

462
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,020
radio time travel I do get this question

463
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,050
actually quite a lot when I'm talking to

464
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,280
people in fact most people if I start if

465
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,230
they say what are you up to these days

466
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,800
and I say well I'm working on a spectrum

467
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,480
archive they sort of slowly back away if

468
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,169
I start talking to them and I don't

469
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,850
blame them but to me the most amazing

470
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,980
thing about spectrum recordings is this

471
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,020
very context rich

472
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,850
I've studied anthropology and

473
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,830
anthropologists are all about context

474
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,959
all that hidden stuff and between the

475
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,470
stations that's so amazing

476
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,020
and personally my favorite part of all

477
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,210
of the spectrum is the shortwave radio

478
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,850
spectrum and I don't know how many of

479
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,370
you know about shortwave radio more and

480
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,780
more people I talk to these days they

481
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,409
kind of think of it as something the

482
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,260
grandpa had here's my twenty thirty

483
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,140
second explanation as we were talking

484
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,120
earlier actually most radio we use these

485
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,550
days and most devices we use like mobile

486
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,659
phones and Wi-Fi routers and laptops and

487
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,330
things work off of something called

488
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,980
line-of-sight propagation so the more

489
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,290
things you have between the transmitting

490
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,290
tower and the receiving antenna the more

491
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,030
attenuation so if you've ever been with

492
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,350
your cellphone in the mountains and

493
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,120
you're talking to somebody net drops out

494
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,059
it's probably because the cellphone

495
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,239
signals the cell phone towers signal

496
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,440
you're actually in the shadow of maybe a

497
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,630
mountain or something like that and you

498
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,380
can't hear it well shortwave radio works

499
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,230
something an entirely different

500
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,490
principle called skywave propagation

501
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,760
depending on the frequency and the time

502
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,590
of day you can broadcast a signal and it

503
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,070
bounces off of the ionosphere and comes

504
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,809
back down to earth in various skip zones

505
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,850
what this means is and I promise you

506
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,830
this I could go buy a 20 dollar

507
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,928
shortwave radio for two double-a

508
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,030
batteries in it you could fly me to the

509
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:24,030
South Pole and as long as I could keep

510
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,270
the radio warm enough to operate I can

511
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,370
receive signals from around the

512
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,190
rolled in one of the most remote parts

513
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,350
of the world because those signals

514
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,410
surround us all the time they're always

515
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,209
there and that's the magic of shortwave

516
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,040
radio and what Bernie was saying earlier

517
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,590
this is the reason why I believe so

518
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,250
powerfully and and and this is a medium

519
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,679
of free speech and a media platform

520
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,630
because essentially this is one of our

521
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,880
teachers in South Sudan and she has a

522
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,330
hand-crank radio she's in a very remote

523
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,490
area

524
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,399
she has no cell phone if she did she

525
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,080
couldn't pay to charge it yet she has a

526
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,880
hand-cranked radio and she can listen to

527
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,250
BBC World Service in English The Voice

528
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,860
of America Radio Japan and a number of

529
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,180
other stations noise Avella just a ton

530
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,719
of other stations that are still on the

531
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,440
air

532
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,810
and shortwave radio has no regard for

533
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,240
borders and if she lived in a country

534
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,440
where the people in power decided they

535
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
didn't want her listening to things

536
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,370
outside the country there's nothing to

537
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,740
stop her from doing that and no one can

538
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,050
really trace her because unless you hear

539
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:31,420
her listening to the radio you don't

540
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:33,250
know what she's listening to and many of

541
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,020
the stations that I had in that very

542
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,720
first recording that I played for you

543
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,360
from 1986 many of those AM broadcasters

544
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,950
are no longer on the air and so there

545
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,590
are a lot of lost signals out there and

546
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:47,560
in the shortwave radio spectrum that's

547
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,000
one of my reasons why I'm out there

548
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,669
making spectrum recordings in the

549
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,430
shortwave broadcast bands and I wanted

550
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,170
to pull up some examples and some little

551
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,810
recorded screencast this is from using

552
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:02,650
this is using my win radio Excalibur SDR

553
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,280
and I pulled up this is from August of

554
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,570
2016 and those of you who don't listen

555
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,430
the shortwave wouldn't know that like

556
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,990
one of the most awesome stations that

557
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,640
used to come on the air every single

558
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,040
morning into North America was radio

559
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,380
Australia and even though they were

560
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,080
halfway across the planet or all the way

561
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,900
across the planet their signal boomed in

562
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,929
and if you look at the spectrum display

563
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,490
here there's like nothing there and as I

564
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,870
was listening for them in this recording

565
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,580
I thought man I must have not had the

566
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,870
antenna plugged in or something but I

567
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,360
think it was just a day a day with

568
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,070
really bad radio propagation skywave

569
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,409
propagation so I'm going to play this

570
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,909
and you'll see how radio Australia you

571
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,180
to come on the air even when no one else

572
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,180
was there

573
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,520
[Applause]

574
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,380
I've given you fairy tales you know

575
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,090
those stories where even if everything

576
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,970
goes wrong at the end there's just

577
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,620
traces of other signals and the

578
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,620
waterfall displayed that radios trail is

579
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,120
[Applause]

580
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,470
used to be my staple radio station in

581
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,928
the morning I'd turned on my I drink my

582
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,940
coffee was really happening in the

583
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,800
background all those perfect story

584
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,630
do you remember re watching a film as an

585
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,159
adult that you'd watched as a child and

586
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,100
real and all your quality was not that

587
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:31,100
bad as good as locally I'm broadcaster

588
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:33,889
coming up Catherine began radio astray

589
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,860
Lea went off the air in January of 2017

590
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,830
with like no fanfare at all they were

591
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,659
just cut and which is happening a lot

592
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:46,100
with shortwave radio stations they say

593
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:49,820
that this is a as a medium for news that

594
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:52,580
it's kind of a sunsetting technology so

595
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,189
I have hours upon hours upon hours of

596
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,240
recording of radio Australia on spectrum

597
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,700
recordings and I can actually go back

598
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,640
and hear them as they used to be on the

599
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,559
air anytime I want to

600
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,050
so here's another recording of the 25

601
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,600
metre band in the shortwave radio bands

602
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,800
this one has more signals if you look in

603
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,350
the waterfall display you see way more

604
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,178
kind of vertical lines there and and

605
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,159
incidentally the little horizontal lines

606
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,780
you see in the spectrum display those

607
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,940
are actually like static rushes from

608
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,260
lightning that's probably a thousand or

609
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,230
two thousand miles away from my home in

610
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,850
North Carolina so I'm just going to let

611
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,620
this kind of run and tune through it

612
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,320
you're going to hear broadcasters and

613
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,610
you'll also hear like I said everything

614
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,010
in between there's even you'll hear a

615
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,139
digital signal and you'll hear a spy

616
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,629
number station everything's there

617
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,850
[Music]

618
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,110
and the little wine that you hear is a

619
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,730
tune around it's because I was running

620
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,530
something called an AM synchronous

621
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,800
detector at the same time they mix up

622
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:57,570
little wine is you too

623
00:26:47,800 --> 00:27:00,428
[Music]

624
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,950
hello this is Bob Donati formerly of

625
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,899
Swiss radio international now

626
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,669
Switzerland in sound calm in Bern

627
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:13,570
Switzerland and you listen to w-why am i

628
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:17,789
coming in you WRA mine dot net send us

629
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,789
your comments and reception reports to

630
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:24,399
[Music]

631
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,349
and that station abruptly went off the

632
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,349
air so widen to filter a little bit

633
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:37,299
that's called an interval signal it's a

634
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:39,190
little like a ditty that stations still

635
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,719
play at the top of the hour before the

636
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:51,309
top of the hour so people know they tune

637
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:53,700
in to the right station that's a Cuban

638
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,690
number station called HM zero one

639
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,829
obviously sending a message to an

640
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,829
operative in North America

641
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,510
[Music]

642
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:06,000
[Applause]

643
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,210
and of course are some weak signals in

644
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,210
here

645
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:21,420
[Music]

646
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:25,949
[Applause]

647
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,710
that wasn't our tty signal I passed over

648
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,560
and that's a radio Havana Cuba which is

649
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:34,360
crazy strong in North America today so

650
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,429
that gives you sort of an idea of what's

651
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,780
there now as much as I love the

652
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,120
broadcast bands with big government

653
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,000
broadcasters and private broadcasters

654
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,810
and everything else like my my very

655
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,020
favorite part of the shortwave bands in

656
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:53,399
terms of it being a dynamic space has to

657
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:56,230
be where you find pirate radio and I

658
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,260
know that like there would be nobody

659
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,880
here involved in pirate radio of course

660
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,230
as we heard in the previous presentation

661
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,010
that sort of things unheard of it hope

662
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,960
but if one were to know where to find

663
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,670
parrot stations and I wouldn't want to

664
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,080
tell you that on shortwave radio you

665
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,790
generally find them somewhere between

666
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,110
about six point nine and seven megahertz

667
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,760
you would find a really dynamic space

668
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,379
where people come on the air they leave

669
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,640
the air you don't know what frequency

670
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,400
they're going to be on and these guys

671
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,170
are operating in a part of the spectrum

672
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,180
where there really isn't any other thing

673
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,490
going on it's kind of a really quiet

674
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,760
part of the spectrum and if you listen

675
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,410
to David Goren's presentation yesterday

676
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,440
where you can hear anything like about

677
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:41,950
36 FM pirates and Brooklyn any given

678
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,190
night the pirate radio space on the

679
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,110
short waves is a lot quieter little less

680
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,530
stations but the people are on there

681
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,060
because you know the barrier of entry to

682
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,120
actually have a shortwave radio station

683
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:57,460
in North America is crazy high it takes

684
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,979
a lot of money to do that so a lot of

685
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,930
these guys just build or modify a piece

686
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,760
of equipment running maybe anywhere from

687
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,020
five watts to hundred watts or something

688
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,240
and they put their station on the air

689
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,280
and if you want to hear pirates listen

690
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,160
on holidays if you want to hear a ton of

691
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,040
pirates listen on Halloween I promise

692
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,410
you I always record the pirate radio

693
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,899
bands on holidays but especially

694
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,310
Halloween I'm usually out I'm a kind of

695
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,510
a busy father so I'm we're doing

696
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,340
trick-or-treating and stuff and I get to

697
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,070
listen to it live and i didn't get to

698
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,100
listen to the halloween pirates of 2016

699
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,240
so when i went to make a recording for

700
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,850
this presentation

701
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,500
I just pulled up some stuff at random

702
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,300
and actually logged a new station this

703
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,100
is one of them now keep in mind these

704
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,550
are these are weak signals so they don't

705
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,320
sound super high fidelity but I'm

706
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,760
receiving this in North Carolina

707
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,730
probably a lot of these stations or

708
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,129
somewhere in the Northeast and here's

709
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:54,900
one of them

710
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:59,010
[Applause]

711
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,920
[Music]

712
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:17,480
[Applause]

713
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:17,480
[Music]

714
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,740
you're cool

715
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:27,040
[Applause]

716
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:35,590
[Music]

717
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:40,600
I mean radio and I do want to go and

718
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:51,669
shout out to enterprise radio where is

719
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:53,889
that Radio City yeah again that showed

720
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,870
up to a radio station further up in the

721
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,920
spectrum than you can say but that was

722
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:06,800
the first time I actually ever logged

723
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:08,780
amphetamine radio and here's another one

724
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,169
[Music]

725
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:16,360
[Applause]

726
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:19,660
while I was kind of like having a good

727
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,729
time with aha here I noticed that

728
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,050
another signal came on the air and if

729
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,540
you look on the waterfall display would

730
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:28,180
come up it's that really strong vertical

731
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,740
stripe that is a pirate radio station

732
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:34,360
tuning up and so I moved to my frequency

733
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,260
down there to where they are to hear the

734
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,260
beginning of their broadcast

735
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,010
[Music]

736
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,800
[Music]

737
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,889
[Music]

738
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:03,850
that is a pirate radio station interval

739
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:05,500
signal me is Holloway in right I was

740
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,820
like who is this pirate so one of the

741
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,830
cool things about a special according is

742
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,049
you can fast forward and rewind to it so

743
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,850
I fast forward it until I saw on the

744
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:13,960
waterfall display that there was sort of

745
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,178
quiet all right

746
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,130
and when it got really quiet I thought

747
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:33,820
well there'll be a you know there will

748
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:35,890
be a an idea in here so that was

749
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,510
Wolverine radio and if you're if you

750
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,690
listen to shortwave pirates I'm not

751
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:44,140
saying anybody here does but Wolverines

752
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,870
out there all the time and I do record a

753
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,720
lot of spectrum pirate radio spectrum

754
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:52,000
doesn't take up a lot of space it's a

755
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,940
relatively narrow part of the radio

756
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,409
spectrum but it still takes up some

757
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,370
digital storage space which is actually

758
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,870
the fourth thing you're going to need

759
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,399
for your time machine if you want to

760
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,418
keep any of that stuff that you're

761
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,510
tuning to to put in perspective I think

762
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:09,639
I can get about 40 gigabytes worth of

763
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,399
space I can get about an hour's worth of

764
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,080
that pirate radio spectrum but the last

765
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,239
three US elections

766
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,549
I've actually recorded the entire a.m.

767
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,939
broadcast band the day before the day of

768
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,889
in the day after one day's worth of an

769
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,619
AM broadcast band recording like that

770
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:30,460
can easily be a terabyte of data it's

771
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:31,810
it's a lot so and some of those

772
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,599
elections are a little easier to listen

773
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:40,570
to than others some can't kind of give

774
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:43,540
me PS PTSD but anyway digital storage is

775
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:45,940
a real issue nonetheless even with

776
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,830
challenges like storage and bandwidth

777
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,899
limitations I can't just send somebody a

778
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,690
file in an email that's a terabyte large

779
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:55,000
right there are also multiple file

780
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,290
formats with STRs they never got

781
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,970
together at the beginning when they were

782
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,830
making SDR applications and said hey

783
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,740
let's standardize on a

784
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,750
they're all based on the same principles

785
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,540
like they tend to use like a wave file

786
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:10,030
but the header information and all that

787
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:13,090
is different depending on the STR

788
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,980
application and the STR being used also

789
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,870
file integrity over the long term if you

790
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,480
are storing them I have about 70

791
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:25,000
terabytes of data at home on hard drives

792
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,400
Western Digital really likes me I get

793
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,250
frequent flyer miles from them I think

794
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,910
and there aren't a lot of applications

795
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,920
that actually run multiple SD ours and

796
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,600
and can read multiple file formats those

797
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,310
three I told you about before are some

798
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,779
of the best at doing that and and there

799
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,570
are there are a couple in Linux and Mac

800
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:47,710
to you but by and large STR applications

801
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:50,050
are kind of limited in that way and of

802
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,700
course the any kind of cost if you want

803
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,500
to have an off-site backup like in the

804
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,689
cloud or something it's one thing to

805
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,700
have I don't know Google or Dropbox or

806
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,410
one of those companies save your your

807
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,410
emails and things but it's another thing

808
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:05,920
if you've got 150 terabytes of data they

809
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:07,960
treat you differently but even though in

810
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,760
these challenges we decided to create

811
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,290
something and I put together a team of

812
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,560
people who are all dedicated to

813
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:16,540
preserving radio spectrum and we have a

814
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,340
website called the radio spectrum

815
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:23,950
archive it's at Spectrum archive.org and

816
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:26,110
and you may wonder why we're doing this

817
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,750
well as I mentioned earlier I think it's

818
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,970
really context rich medium and I can

819
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,340
imagine a day in the future where

820
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:36,009
museums like the Museum in Washington DC

821
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,530
which focuses on broadcast history where

822
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,450
you may have a kiosk and with a simple

823
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,010
radio interface like we were talking

824
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,480
about earlier like the FM dial where you

825
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,340
have a tuning knob and you have a volume

826
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,620
knob and you can pull up a recording

827
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,950
imagine going back and pulling up a

828
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:53,920
recording from say December of 1941 and

829
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,810
listening to the news as it came through

830
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,900
all the major networks when the Japanese

831
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:00,490
were attacking Pearl Harbor I mean yeah

832
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,650
that technology didn't exist then but it

833
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:05,770
exists now and we're making recordings

834
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,450
now in fact I would say my a.m.

835
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,700
broadcast ban recordings I make those

836
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,509
when there's any significant like very

837
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,339
significant news event

838
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:16,299
and during elections and other things

839
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:19,339
and I imagine future media specialists

840
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:21,288
archivists historians and

841
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:23,029
anthropologists going back in probably

842
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,949
looking at some of these recordings were

843
00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:27,289
making now of the broadcast bands and

844
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,909
trying to figure out why most of the

845
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:31,039
people in the United States when they

846
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:32,779
consumed media couldn't do so very

847
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,199
critically and know the difference

848
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:38,599
between subjective and objective and

849
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,919
real and fake this is probably a time

850
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,149
we're going to go back and look at that

851
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:45,558
and wonder what was happening also a lot

852
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:47,569
of broadcasters have gone off the air

853
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,069
and we have a lot of these in spectrum

854
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:52,429
recordings now me and some of the other

855
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:55,519
people and the archive team and actually

856
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:58,069
David Goren has said once that spectrum

857
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,779
files are a little bit like a fine

858
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,808
vintage wine that you can pull from your

859
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:04,039
wine cellar and you open it up and

860
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:06,019
there's this like the day where

861
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,219
something was happening or maybe the

862
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,629
signals were just really coming in

863
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,859
really well or something or there's

864
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,079
something important there and you can

865
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,359
listen to it and that is really what

866
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,759
it's like I can I can open this wine

867
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:18,859
cellar by just shifting some files to my

868
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:20,569
laptop when I'm taking a train from

869
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:23,119
Washington DC to New York City I can

870
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:25,159
listen to these in real time these

871
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,019
time-shifted recordings as I'm on the

872
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,299
train if I want to but wouldn't it be

873
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:31,638
cool if you could actually share your

874
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:33,079
wine cellar with the world and everybody

875
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,209
else who has their own wine cellar could

876
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,589
do that well one of the really cool

877
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:39,138
things that happen after the radio

878
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:41,569
preservation task force meeting is by

879
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,219
way of a really kind person with the

880
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:47,779
Wikimedia Foundation they introduced us

881
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:49,369
to the Internet Archive team and who are

882
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:53,959
actually represented here at hope as

883
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:56,359
well they enthusiastically agreed to

884
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:58,368
house our spectrum files even with the

885
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:01,909
warning of these are kind of big are you

886
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:04,339
sure and and so we're in the process now

887
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:07,699
of uploading files and creating our own

888
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,259
collection on the archive which will be

889
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:11,449
really amazing because all you'll have

890
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:13,549
to do is download a file and download a

891
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:16,159
free application and you can do your own

892
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:17,419
radio time travel at home you can hear

893
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,679
you can listen to recordings people

894
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,848
haven't even really listened to yet that

895
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,009
they've just recorded and they've

896
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:24,490
they've put up there for the future and

897
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:28,240
you can do research if you want to

898
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:30,069
at the moment it is kind of limited to

899
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,660
downloading a file and downloading an

900
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,910
application that coincides with it but I

901
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:37,120
imagine a day where maybe we could

902
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:39,100
create a web interface something like

903
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,560
the web SDR at the University of Twente

904
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,930
and and the Netherlands they have an

905
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,880
online SDR that about probably over 200

906
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,190
people can share at once and it's kind

907
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,900
of amazing I imagine the same thing the

908
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,060
technology's there to do this as well

909
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,230
and from our talks with the Internet

910
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,570
Archive they'd like to see that happen

911
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,490
but it may take developers and if

912
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,040
there's anyone here who's interested in

913
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,750
talking with us about that I'd love to

914
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,490
hear about it because frankly we would

915
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,410
like to make radio time machines

916
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:16,810
available to anyone who would like to

917
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:17,859
have them so thank you very much and I

918
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,440
can't see if there's anybody with

919
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,210
questions okay there's a great talk I

920
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,470
really really enjoyed this one if I

921
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,060
could do a really quick shameless plug

922
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,740
but that leads into a question so in a

923
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,660
half hour we're gonna do a workshop on

924
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,520
turning live Bluetooth packet traffic

925
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,890
into sounds so it kind of goes along

926
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,900
these lines leads into my question which

927
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,029
is as broadcast now more and more is

928
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,370
obviously in an analog medium but doing

929
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,950
digital broadcast I'm curious in terms

930
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:44,080
of storage capture and everything if you

931
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,980
see that as a positive and negative and

932
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,810
all the challenges if you could maybe

933
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,450
speak quickly to that if you want to

934
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,820
capture that okay and in terms of taking

935
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,279
you're talking about taking the

936
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,250
difference between archiving digital

937
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,840
versus analog exactly okay yeah really

938
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,330
spectrum recordings don't care if

939
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:04,540
something's analog or digital and they

940
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:06,040
just record what's there so for example

941
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,590
on the FM broadcast band if you're

942
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,490
recording the entire broadcast band you

943
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:14,380
would honestly you could have a number

944
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,979
of digital FM stations that are running

945
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:20,410
two or three HD channels all at once and

946
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,850
it's recording them because it doesn't

947
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,270
care if it's analog or digital or

948
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,630
anything

949
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,220
so really digital actually in a way you

950
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:32,260
can probably fit more into a piece of

951
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,879
spectrum with some digital broadcasts so

952
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,230
yeah it's always going to be there with

953
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,270
spectrum recordings could you envisage

954
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,340
though decoding the

955
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,530
signal and recording it as digital and

956
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,450
having that as for for compression for

957
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,490
instance yeah you could actually go back

958
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,379
in to any of our spectrum recordings

959
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,939
that have digital signals and decode

960
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,590
them at a later time and do what you'd

961
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:55,780
like to with them awesome pics

962
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:58,810
yeah cool so I'm I played with SDR is a

963
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,790
little bit and I'm really bad at it and

964
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:03,250
I'm just wondering like you got a lot of

965
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,020
really weak signals and signals from all

966
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:08,200
over the world like I have a little

967
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,540
twenty five dollar SDR thing like could

968
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,359
I pick those up with that like do I need

969
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,880
like a wire antenna like to a tree like

970
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:21,130
that yeah that's a really good question

971
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,730
actually you can you can use a twenty

972
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,230
five dollar

973
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,820
radio to do that but if you live in an

974
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,430
urban area you're not going to cut it

975
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,310
with the RTL SDR dongle that $25 dongle

976
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,649
because it's so easily overloaded by

977
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,410
stronger local broadcast signals and

978
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,120
also noises like lighting and power

979
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,839
supplies and things that switch and make

980
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,890
noises on the radio so the best thing

981
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,080
you can do with something like that's

982
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,330
get a laptop and take it out into a

983
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,950
field a national park or something and

984
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,650
throw a little wire up in a tree and

985
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:54,460
you'll be able to hear a lot more or

986
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:57,400
invest in a an SDR like the $100 or more

987
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,720
STRs that I was showing you and if you

988
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,160
want to do this at home and you live in

989
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,790
an urban area you'd want to look at a

990
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,290
magnetic loop antenna those amplify the

991
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:08,850
magnetic portion of the electromagnetic

992
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:11,020
spectrum or electromagnetic signal and

993
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,000
it's a lot cleaner doesn't have all the

994
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,520
noises and things so you can do that but

995
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,470
absolutely with the right equipment and

996
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,610
it's really a modest investment and the

997
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,740
right antenna which you can build

998
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,530
yourself you can definitely pick up

999
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:27,160
signals from around the world hey how

1000
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,320
are you how you talk I've used STRs is

1001
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,540
like kind of a poor man's spectrum

1002
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,730
analyzer yeah there's a lot of different

1003
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:37,770
functions you were just talking about

1004
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:40,840
the loop antennas my question is I have

1005
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,780
RTL setup I have the like the ham it up

1006
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,700
adapter right you know it's not as

1007
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,670
sensitive as I thought it would be right

1008
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,379
what what single antenna you know or

1009
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,810
what combination of antennas can

1010
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:56,140
I use and I'm I live not in a very urban

1011
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:58,440
area but just to get a little bit more

1012
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,140
than you know than what I've got now

1013
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,640
okay so to answer your question this

1014
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,830
again if you've got the Hammad up a

1015
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,350
doctor adapter I guess which is an up

1016
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,090
converter I'm not sure what kind of fill

1017
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,190
filters that has in it

1018
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:15,070
but you have to be careful of

1019
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,620
overloading that particular receiver the

1020
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:21,130
rtl-sdr dongle it was never designed for

1021
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,990
HF reception really if it can handle it

1022
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,670
you could put up what I use at my house

1023
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,589
actually is I build it myself with

1024
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,350
probably thirty dollars of parts a

1025
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:34,210
horizontal Delta loop antenna so I have

1026
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:37,029
a horizontal loop that strong with three

1027
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,770
trees and it looks like a big triangle

1028
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,660
and then I have a piece of ladder line

1029
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,210
that comes down to a box which

1030
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,980
eventually goes into my SDR those are

1031
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,510
really good they're omnidirectional and

1032
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,130
they're really quiet so if you do have

1033
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,680
electro noise as electrical noises

1034
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,990
around you can you don't hear as many of

1035
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,000
them with a horizontal Delta loop were

1036
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,950
there any of the STRs that you were

1037
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,830
showing us before that would be better

1038
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:02,890
for spectrum analysis I would look at

1039
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,810
the RSP one a night yeah they just

1040
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,580
actually one of their community members

1041
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:10,150
one of the cool things I like about them

1042
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:12,880
they're great people they have a really

1043
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:15,700
robust community with lots of tutorial

1044
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,170
videos and lots of documentation and one

1045
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,960
of their community members just made a

1046
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,360
spectrum analyzer application for their

1047
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,740
SDR and so I would look at that one it's

1048
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:27,510
a hundred bucks you really can't go

1049
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,470
wrong with it okay thanks for the talk I

1050
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,740
wondered if you could speak a little bit

1051
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:34,180
to the difference in I guess available

1052
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,459
spectrum that you can look at with each

1053
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:40,299
of the STRs that you showed right okay

1054
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:42,520
so the wider like actually it's kind of

1055
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,260
weird but they the more expensive SDR is

1056
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,790
tend to specialize in a particular

1057
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,800
portion of the spectrum and they have

1058
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:51,340
filters that inside the SDR that are

1059
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,740
built for that so the wider band radios

1060
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:57,760
tend to be the cheaper ones like the the

1061
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:59,410
ones at $200 and less that are SP one I

1062
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,660
have been talking about goes from one

1063
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,370
kilohertz up to two gigahertz so they're

1064
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,089
just a number of applications you can do

1065
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,339
in there

1066
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,540
the rtl-sdr dongle doesn't go down to

1067
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,760
one kilohertz but it's pretty low I

1068
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,950
think it goes down into the am broadcast

1069
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,140
band it's not a particularly fine

1070
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,720
performer down there but it covers all

1071
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,810
the way up into the gigahertz range I

1072
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,399
can't remember what the top end of it is

1073
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,380
if you are looking for one and you're

1074
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,210
wanting to a wide variety of things with

1075
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,290
it look look for one that's wide band

1076
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,780
you always want to check the frequency

1077
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:32,020
coverage first and just check out the

1078
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,570
specs on all those most of the lower end

1079
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,970
are like $200 less STRs tend to be

1080
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:41,290
wideband actually so they're kind of

1081
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:42,939
more versatile in that way is there

1082
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,009
anybody else like yeah yeah

1083
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:49,480
are there any intellectual property

1084
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:51,730
concerns with becoming a recorder make

1085
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,510
it to help you archived oh for the

1086
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:59,110
archive well so you know it's kind of

1087
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:02,410
funny the the contents kind of embedded

1088
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,180
in these files and I spoke with some

1089
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,940
universities at one point they're very

1090
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,279
very risk-averse they don't want to take

1091
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,380
on any recordings that could have copy

1092
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,540
written material in them but to even

1093
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,650
playback one of these like one of the

1094
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,170
things we're working out with Internet

1095
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,270
Archive is our files to the Internet

1096
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,860
Archive look like a WAV file like a

1097
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,060
regular audio file so when we send it up

1098
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,280
there it wants to turn it into an mp3

1099
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,720
and all these other formats but if you

1100
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,170
play those you don't hear anything

1101
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,490
because it is not an audio recording so

1102
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,460
you have to have a piece of software to

1103
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,660
even to code that in the first place and

1104
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,130
everything's kind of lo-fi so I don't

1105
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,140
think there's going to be any issues

1106
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,810
with this there certainly wouldn't be if

1107
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,580
you're making recordings for yourself

1108
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,580
and we're definitely not making any

1109
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,770
money on this so it's only costing a lot

1110
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,230
of money which isn't a great business

1111
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:54,250
plan but it works for what we're trying

1112
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:57,940
to do could you tell us about the state

1113
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:00,430
of archiving of the a.m. bandwidth in

1114
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,380
the United States four important things

1115
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:05,680
it sounds like you do this as a hobby

1116
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:08,890
around elections is anybody running like

1117
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,890
a ring buffer so if something really

1118
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:14,589
important happens we can hit it and have

1119
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,180
the last four hours of the am band in a

1120
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,359
major area is that something you're

1121
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,368
you're thinking about it

1122
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,319
lighting up the country having an

1123
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:23,660
organized system so we've got it all

1124
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:26,359
yeah I I think that's a fantastic idea

1125
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,180
and I've talked to people before they're

1126
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,140
in government departments that say that

1127
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,269
you know the government have been

1128
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,879
they've actually been making spectrum

1129
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:36,439
recordings but they just don't keep them

1130
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,019
they're not interested in most of them

1131
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,119
so they kind of trash them there are no

1132
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:42,348
other efforts I know of in fact one of

1133
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,779
the interesting things from the radio

1134
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:46,730
preservation task force meeting is out

1135
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:48,410
of all the broadcasters out there public

1136
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,739
broadcaster's tend to do the best job of

1137
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,808
archiving all of their material am are I

1138
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:56,269
should say commercial broadcasters on

1139
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:58,430
the other hand they are more future

1140
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:00,879
thinking they don't think about their

1141
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:04,009
past as much and usually those that have

1142
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,109
archives of their broadcasts and their

1143
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:08,450
radios history the radio station history

1144
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:10,400
those are kind of outliers and usually

1145
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:12,078
there's some one person championing that

1146
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,880
and then when the station gets bought by

1147
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,529
another station the next one says okay

1148
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,150
yeah that roomful of like tapes and

1149
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:19,730
things yeah it's got to go we need that

1150
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:21,859
space and so they trash it all there's

1151
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,930
no one I know of actually doing as

1152
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,999
you're saying like archive recording our

1153
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,288
spectrum recordings all the time and

1154
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:28,819
then they can just kind of hit a button

1155
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:30,680
and make sure they're capturing and

1156
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:33,558
saving things as they're happening but I

1157
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,999
do see a day when we're doing that it

1158
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:36,950
can certainly be done there just isn't

1159
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:41,790
any software right now that can make

1160
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:51,210
that happen thank you very much

1161
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:51,210
[Applause]
