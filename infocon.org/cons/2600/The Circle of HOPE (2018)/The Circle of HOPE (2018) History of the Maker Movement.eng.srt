1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
okay well let's get this started I'm

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,790
Phil Tyrone I'll talk a little bit about

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,639
how I came into the maker world in a bit

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,518
but I wanted these folks who have three

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,650
interesting stories over the course of

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,470
ten years and what this thing called

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,119
make and making is it's it's it's not

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,759
the first time people have made things

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,930
for sure because I know that always

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,340
comes up it's like oh people were making

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,019
things in the 50s and you know whatever

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,698
we've been making things since the dawn

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,040
of time this is specifically the last

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,320
ten years or so of something called make

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,820
with Make Magazine and Maker Faire so

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,120
who are you

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,770
hi I'm a little more free lady ADA so

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,269
I'm an engineer and I have a company

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,090
here in New York called Adafruit we'll

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,750
talk more about that in a little bit

21
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,879
next up Mitch Altman and probably best

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,070
known for inventing tv-b-gone a keychain

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,739
that turns off TVs in public places and

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,719
also a co-founder of one of the early

25
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,250
hacker spaces in the u.s. noise bridge

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,809
and hello I'm Shari HUS and the

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,990
co-founder of maker faire which we

28
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:10,200
started back in 2006 and very much an

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:16,619
advocate for makers and glad to be here

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,210
today all right ok ok so for a really

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,110
long time I was kind of writing about

32
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,479
this stuff

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,619
I started hackaday made the logo the

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,570
hackaday he's the site is still around

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm stop by and see hackaday they have a

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,639
booth area and are giving away cookies

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,809
and I was writing for popular science in

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:41,009
a new section called how 2.0 and this

39
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,630
was like 2003 2004 or something and it

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,079
started hackaday it was an offshoot of

41
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,729
Engadget I was the second author and we

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,919
did something called how to Tuesday and

43
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,329
that kind of took off and it turned into

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,490
something it's like oh here you can like

45
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,949
put Linux on your iPod that was back in

46
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,509
the day when you can do that and

47
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,829
tutorials became more and more popular

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,450
and it turned out the Internet's a good

49
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,079
place to put tutorials and things

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,820
besides just gadget reviews and then

51
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,728
after hackaday was it was going pretty

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,220
well they were moving towards selling

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,890
the entire blog network to AOL which

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,140
they eventually did but hackaday was

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,549
purchasable it was 2 a.m. well it was

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,290
like uh this is gonna be a legal

57
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,180
nightmare so it was the only one that

58
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,579
kind of survived out of some of those

59
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,900
those blogs from back in the day but I

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,070
was already kind of on my way out cuz

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,810
I'm like okay like that was something

62
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,670
really neat wanted to start at the

63
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,200
hackaday manifesto and a lot of the

64
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,640
things are still going on the hackaday

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,649
crew that's there right now absolutely

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,179
amazing hackaday prize check out all the

67
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,860
things that they're up to I'll even have

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,580
a comic book a lot of the cool stuff

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,070
that I wanted to do the great art so Oh

70
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,270
Riley day we did books and then they

71
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,269
were gonna get involved with a magazine

72
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,830
in the CTO at O'Reilly at the time rail

73
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,180
said oh Dale wants to talk to you Dale

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,310
was to publisher

75
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,280
I think co-founder River O'Reilly and he

76
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,840
was he was a publisher of like awk Oren

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,270
said I think that was his like book that

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,860
he did and he said oh I want to do a

79
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,780
magazine and we don't know we're gonna

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,730
call it yet you think said like makers

81
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,459
are making like that's a terrible idea

82
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,720
sign me up so because it's like a print

83
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,880
magazine about this stuff I remember

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,870
when I started pakad a the the feedback

85
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,120
was there's no way you're gonna be able

86
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,250
to find a project every single day and

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,049
if you look at hack a day right now it's

88
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,970
like you know 20 it could be like 20

89
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,230
posts a day just depends on what's going

90
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,510
on and this is the stuff that everyone

91
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,429
gets to same thing with me can't believe

92
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,720
like there's gonna be a magazine there's

93
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,549
not enough people making and sharing

94
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,890
things but it turned out that was that

95
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,000
was a good idea so I was writing about

96
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,559
this stuff and then eventually you know

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,750
full disclosure I've worked with more

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,610
and more obviously partners we did

99
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,950
citizen engineer and we've been doing

100
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,860
stuff in the hacker world and hope for a

101
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,119
really long time but I stopped being

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,190
able to write about it cuz then I was

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,230
doing stuff like working in electronics

104
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,160
and helping run a company so it's one of

105
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,070
those things where you don't get a

106
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,660
chance to to write about this movement

107
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,420
and so I thought this would be a good

108
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,739
like living with Wikipedia article with

109
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,750
some of the people that you might not

110
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,630
know their stories a lot of people don't

111
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,890
know that Shari was an running

112
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,209
makerfaire a lot of people don't know

113
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,380
some of the history of Noisebridge and a

114
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,660
lot of people don't know we're a little

115
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,880
more came from with electronics so I

116
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,660
thought I'd start with Lady ADA and

117
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,120
you're best known for I think this thing

118
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,589
the hacker world yeah this is my cell

119
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,050
phone okay so here's the thing I

120
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,030
actually had to graduate school I was in

121
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,300
college and I had to come up with a

122
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,950
thesis project and I actually convinced

123
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,410
my advisor that's building a cell phone

124
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,920
jammer was a totally legit way to get my

125
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,500
thesis um so that was pretty sweet and

126
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,120
so you know thanks for a lot of

127
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,620
documentation online actually this is

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,600
you know the project that I built for my

129
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,940
thesis and I published it open-source

130
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,430
hardware I was doing open source

131
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,810
hardware at the time which I'll talk

132
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,490
about in just a little bit because it

133
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,190
intersects a lot with what what Mitch

134
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,270
and I were doing back in 2005 but you

135
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,130
know this is something that the illegal

136
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,099
to own illegal to use but it's legal to

137
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,390
publish the documentation about tipping

138
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,710
this on my website putting my thesis I

139
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,419
graduated so that's really great

140
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,130
although sometimes I have that nightmare

141
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,140
where you like having graduated for some

142
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,430
reason like some document you decide it

143
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,840
was a deferred a company while you're

144
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,800
doing this or you you you had not

145
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,940
started um so when I first the first

146
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,410
isn't this actually version was the

147
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,690
second revision and you can see it was

148
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,920
an i-beam so when I started there was no

149
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,890
Adafruit yet this was I was still a

150
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,150
student I was at the Media Lab and

151
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,360
actually explain how this intersects

152
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,010
with hacking with with making as I was

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,169
working on this at the Media Lab where's

154
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,659
doing my thesis there was this guy who

155
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,870
was in a room I was in this place called

156
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,640
the cube and there was another room

157
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,930
where this group called Center for bits

158
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,110
and atoms was and there was this grad

159
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,570
student named Saul Griffith and Saul

160
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,070
Griffith was one of the people who was

161
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,380
organ you know working with you to

162
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,849
organize and make a magazine so that's

163
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,310
always building like cell phone jammers

164
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,169
and you know later TV cons and stuff

165
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,400
Saul would come by and say hey you know

166
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,590
that's a really cool project working on

167
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,969
you want to totally like write a bunch

168
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,140
of articles for free for this magazine

169
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,600
now this is like yeah sure yeah I'll do

170
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,240
that like why not so that's how I got

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,020
involved with make was actually through

172
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,870
somebody at the Media Lab who was

173
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,099
watching me work on this project and

174
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,570
when I was working on this project I was

175
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,650
kind of I don't know why I thought this

176
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,050
was an idea I was like oh I know I'll do

177
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,270
a couple projects for my thesis and I

178
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,980
wanted to do something similar to a cell

179
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,419
phone jammer or something that turned

180
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,450
off cellphones but I want something turn

181
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,469
off televisions and at this exact time

182
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,930
like a little like the same

183
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,140
month that I was looking at how to do

184
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,480
this I read an article about sky

185
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,849
actually so I'll tell you the truth when

186
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,230
I first read about TV gone from

187
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,970
cornfield electronics I was like

188
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,740
cornfield electronics like this guy must

189
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,180
be so boring but it was like you don't

190
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,930
even think cornfield that's just like I

191
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,420
was like what is this like Ohio but so

192
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,980
um the TV gone was is kind of neat

193
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,560
because it actually it was exactly the

194
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,900
same time this is what we were saying

195
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,430
earlier we have these three stories and

196
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,659
they all it's like those movies where

197
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,920
there's like three different timelines

198
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,380
at the end it's like oh they're all the

199
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,330
same cafe together you know we

200
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,080
intersected all at the same time which

201
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,390
is kind of a blessing but at the time I

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,609
was working on the stuff and publishing

203
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,450
and trying to start a company making

204
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,010
electronics it's only like you know me

205
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,419
and like a couple people in this room so

206
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,320
I'll just tell the truth I was actually

207
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,229
getting a little burnt out with the

208
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,020
hacker scene I spent a lot of time the

209
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,730
90s and early 2000 hacker scene and like

210
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,490
I've been to a lot of def cons and some

211
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,250
are cons and pump cons and I I think I

212
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,000
was kind of ready for something new

213
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,040
there's absolute nothing wrong with

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,950
those conferences and the events but it

215
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,350
started to diverge a little bit from the

216
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,669
stuff I was interested in there's just

217
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,010
like so many times can get like a really

218
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,390
drunk in Las Vegas and doing a lot of

219
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,000
drugs like I you know we did I did that

220
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,520
I did that and so what I thought was

221
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,330
interesting about make and the magazine

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,190
that came a little bit for that

223
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,690
ready-made was this was a different

224
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,790
approach the same kind of technological

225
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,160
interest I had right coding and

226
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,740
soldering and making stuff Burning Man

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,440
projects sharing open-source it had a

228
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,450
lot of the same philosophies just like a

229
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,360
little bit less of like this really

230
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,919
hardcore hacker scene which I was

231
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,290
totally part of it it's like you know I

232
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,210
take credit and blame for everything

233
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,740
that you know I'm responsible for but I

234
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,150
wanted to learn this fresh start you

235
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,550
know I wanted something a little bit

236
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,640
different I think Mitch you're and

237
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,340
Sheree you guys did such a good job at

238
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,570
making community you know like when you

239
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,338
talk about noise bridge about being

240
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,080
excellent to each other about being

241
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,800
cluesive about getting different peoples

242
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,360
from different parts of society and not

243
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,069
just hackers

244
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,690
hackers at Noisebridge hackers at Maker

245
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,399
Faire but a lot of different other

246
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,709
people that crafters people do 3d

247
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,540
printing people who do robotics and see

248
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,540
and see kids who are learning

249
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,250
programming people doing wearable

250
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,279
electronics at the wearable group with

251
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,220
the Media Lab too so I think that having

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,329
making a this parallel track if there is

253
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,560
you can see the borrowing what you do

254
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,790
that you can see lockpick village here

255
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,518
there's also a lockpick village at Def

256
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,689
Con right you can see a lockpick village

257
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,980
at Maker Faire

258
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,220
but the soldering workshops that you've

259
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,420
done actually started to leak into

260
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,970
hacker conferences hacker seen like

261
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,319
they're never used to be big soldering

262
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,459
workshops and now there are so I think

263
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,649
there's been a lot of really good

264
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,529
cross-pollination between the groups

265
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:30,649
okay so cellphone jammer and then before

266
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:31,579
that though this was the first time the

267
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,779
people were starting to share

268
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,029
electronics of putting a software

269
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,500
license yes that seems to be an

270
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,120
ingredient in the maker world cuz that's

271
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,649
kind of it'll be the next part of the

272
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,810
story with with Mitch and tv-b-gone

273
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,720
which wasn't an open-source thing that

274
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,479
was really scary but where did that

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
where did that come from did was her she

276
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,890
was just you was it a group of people

277
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,320
and having been in like you know this

278
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:57,050
Boston hacker scene Boston of courses

279
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,970
you know the FSF FSF at the time there

280
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,790
was a FF I think had just moved to

281
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,110
California there was this an MIT at MIT

282
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,829
which were where I was there was a

283
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,800
culture of

284
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:10,040
open-source had a licensee MIT license

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,719
you know it's the best license and so

286
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,860
you know we loved bike shedding that

287
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,560
license were like let's brings the

288
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,329
hardware but but Saul Griffiths that

289
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,279
student he was actually doing open

290
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,959
switch hardware with kite design at the

291
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,120
time and so I thought that was very

292
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,018
interesting he's taking the idea of

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,600
publishing kite CAD files under

294
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,540
open-source license of people can hack

295
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,630
and you know revised kite surfing kites

296
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,760
and at the time like I there wasn't

297
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,810
people were publishing open-source

298
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,970
hardware in the sense they were

299
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,410
publishing skip max obviously like I did

300
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,320
not come up with this idea right anyone

301
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,390
who's open an apple to manual come to a

302
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,690
schematics but the idea of trying to get

303
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,160
the circuit board designs up online

304
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,899
the

305
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,399
materials up online and the CAD files

306
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,879
and having this under an open-source

307
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,889
license was a little bit new and again

308
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,420
like we need no licensing we just said

309
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,220
like I don't know Creative Commons like

310
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,389
what the like we you know it it

311
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,410
doesn't even apply like new we still

312
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:07,120
don't know where X has never been to

313
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,519
court so who knows whether any of this

314
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,860
even makes sense but we wanted to get

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,470
our idea we we wanted to distribute this

316
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,449
hardware and tell people what we

317
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,509
expected from it from people using it

318
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,769
and give people more rights than they

319
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,910
might think like some people may not

320
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:25,240
realize no it's okay you can make a

321
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:28,329
company out of it like you did with TV

322
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,740
got or you can sell stuff and people in

323
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,180
the maker community a lot of it is

324
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,040
funded from people making kits and

325
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,829
selling stuff through whether it be

326
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,040
tindy or Kickstarter or at Maker Faire

327
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:40,959
events it was kind of an interesting new

328
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,599
idea but I think it came from this

329
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,459
hacker coder mentality that was in

330
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,250
Boston started with open source software

331
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,349
and kind of colliding with people being

332
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,240
able to publish files online it seemed

333
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,759
like a natural progression okay so then

334
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,870
you started eight free yeah and you do a

335
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,459
bunch of electronics now are they all

336
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,829
still open source hardware yes

337
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:06,969
everything is open source hardware that

338
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:08,589
can be okay and we've actually gotten

339
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,259
other companies to just kind of neat

340
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,029
like I've had chip companies who never

341
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,130
did open source and we kind of pressured

342
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,800
them to do stuff open source so it's it

343
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,329
it's slow and thing you know but it does

344
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,040
work eventually like you people see the

345
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,829
benefit it seems to be the standard now

346
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,870
like Arduino if they release the board

347
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,589
the expectation is there's disco maddox

348
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,180
there's the source code for it there's

349
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:33,550
an open source license yes this was not

350
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,959
normal at the gym I mean it there there

351
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,120
was documentation but nothing was

352
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,849
available open source I think I think

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,319
that yeah having about 2006 or so with a

354
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,360
large proliferation of open source

355
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,160
hardware projects it became a natural

356
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,660
thing people do I also think people

357
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,610
noticed how you can do it but source

358
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,829
hardware and and that wasn't the reason

359
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,509
your business or project failed right

360
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,099
that was it was if it failed it failed

361
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,750
for maybe other reasons but it was

362
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,980
rarely because you put something under

363
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,230
an open-source license I think people

364
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,730
were scared of that once he saw like oh

365
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,250
wait there's a group of people doing

366
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,160
this it's working out join in

367
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:10,870
the party and as far as giving all this

368
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,149
stuff away so it ate fruit is still loan

369
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,189
free venture capital free profitable

370
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:21,149
manufacturers electronics in the USA in

371
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:23,079
New York City these are my machines I

372
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,029
pretty much did this just so I could buy

373
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:28,089
these machines yeah that's to pick in

374
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:31,120
places a stencil in an oven just a full

375
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,920
picking place lime here in in New York

376
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,199
here's some of our folks we have

377
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,670
healthcare and 401k and paid time off

378
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:41,279
for charity and mothers remember giving

379
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,279
off I'm wearing my FF shirts yeah and

380
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,139
yeah we're in your company and you know

381
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,699
we are we are on New Yorkers and it's

382
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,620
been an adventure over the last ten

383
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:52,000
years we have know one hundred and

384
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,569
twenty eight hundred thirty people all

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,860
together doing these as a team is pretty

386
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,719
exciting and think you know a lot of a

387
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,699
lot of hackers and makers have gone on

388
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,110
to start companies so you know it's it's

389
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,670
a challenge taking the stuff in your

390
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,839
brain making it real and then working

391
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,670
with all these people to make it happen

392
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:12,790
but we have really great people so it's

393
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,469
my job's easy and one thing that I

394
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,680
thought that would be neat to do sue

395
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,939
when you have a company or community or

396
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,500
products you know sometimes you get

397
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:23,670
copied and that's that could be really

398
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,379
good so we're working with our

399
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,628
employment lawyer and we're gonna give a

400
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,160
paid day off for Election Day this year

401
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:34,449
as a company but it should be a federal

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,839
holiday right yeah so what I'm sure it

403
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,508
is

404
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,389
so a deferred did pay time off for

405
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:42,939
charity so that employees can do any

406
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:46,269
type of 501 3 C charity it's not the

407
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:48,099
founders only charity sometimes company

408
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,709
owners kind of force everyone to like

409
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,290
whatever they like this is for the

410
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,989
employees do whatever they want so part

411
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,050
of this I wanted to kind of seep in some

412
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,430
ideas for building communities the maker

413
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,050
movement is a movement we're all getting

414
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,819
older so like someone has to keep

415
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,889
carrying this on but that's just one

416
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,449
thing that you can do if you put out

417
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,160
your schematics in your source code it's

418
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,300
a good thing it for it to be copied if

419
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,930
you talked about how some of your

420
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,060
businesses run

421
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,890
and it's good that could be copied some

422
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,849
things you'll hear about workshops and

423
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,150
hackerspaces

424
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,290
and maker fairs with millions of people

425
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,110
there's some good things to copy with

426
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,689
that okay so enough about me dammit

427
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,620
so Mitch when I met you you had a closed

428
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,690
source tv-b-gone and I remember I think

429
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,610
you were doing the radio show you were

430
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,590
doing off the hook

431
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,000
and you knew and you were you were in

432
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:46,220
the hope world or right like I think

433
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,820
that's yeah you tell us yeah well you

434
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,340
know I've been a gig all my life and

435
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:55,580
eventually I was able to call myself an

436
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,410
inventor which was scary move probably

437
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,290
when I was in grad school and made a

438
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,050
music synthesizer as my master's thesis

439
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:07,010
and it's like yeah I guess I'm an

440
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:10,699
inventor and my brother is a patent

441
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,680
lawyer so back then there was no such

442
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,180
thing as open hardware

443
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,479
it's just what one did no one even

444
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,979
thought about this stuff and then I

445
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,230
invented tv-b-gone it turned out a lot

446
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,220
of people thought it was cool to turn

447
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,350
TVs off who knew and and so I since I

448
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,110
had experience with manufacturing at

449
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,440
previous jobs which were terrible idea

450
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,840
the job not the manufacturing and and so

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,190
I had to extricate myself and hire three

452
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,530
people to replace all the

453
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,430
responsibilities that I had and then I

454
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,449
was free a question were you will you

455
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,219
attending concerts like hope and doing

456
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,530
off the hook before you did TP gunner

457
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,820
they're like what's it known so this was

458
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,490
when I did tv-b-gone

459
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,110
I was 2003 and then I started

460
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,750
manufacturing it because people wanted

461
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,820
it and and then it was an overnight hit

462
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,670
and it changed my life forever and I got

463
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,550
calls from all these totally bizarre

464
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:07,909
weird cool people including someone

465
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,379
who's a hope organizer Bernie yes and he

466
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,050
ordered a box to give away to friends

467
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,630
and he said you know come do this thing

468
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,399
it's a hacker conference hacker you know

469
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,120
that word and then you you know what

470
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,690
that hell's that

471
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,089
and but I looked into it and it wasn't

472
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,910
what the mainstream media said people

473
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,609
breaking

474
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,680
and stealing stuff there was people come

475
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,870
together to share and learn and teach

476
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,480
and you know it's like it's you know

477
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,760
community and like I'm a geek and I was

478
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,980
excluded from community growing up and

479
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,030
so it sounded like was scary I'm an

480
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:46,490
introverted geek but uh okay and so I

481
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:48,870
came here and it changed my life forever

482
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,760
you know first time in my life where I

483
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:56,520
felt at home you know in a group it was

484
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,990
it was I almost cried it was amazing and

485
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,360
but before that I was looking online for

486
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,480
something tv-b-gone related and I came

487
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,050
across someone who I'd never heard of

488
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,280
who had a master's thesis that had this

489
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:16,260
thing that was glasses that would turn

490
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,350
opaque whenever a TV became into the

491
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:23,370
field of view it turned out to be

492
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,909
L'Amour very foreshadowing and I'm like

493
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,280
this is awesome I have to contact this

494
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:33,120
person so I did and we emailed a bunch

495
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,580
back and forth and and it seemed really

496
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,590
cool so but but I didn't know if we'd

497
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,850
ever meet but in 2006 the more emailed

498
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,699
me and said hey we're going to be in San

499
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,070
Francisco to go to this Maker Faire and

500
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,950
like what the hell's a Maker Faire and

501
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,490
look for shadowing I looked online about

502
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,110
that and then it was all he it was make

503
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,250
magazine it's been around for a year and

504
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,719
like why haven't I heard about this

505
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,520
world because I've been like going like

506
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,510
crazy hardly getting any sleep trying to

507
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,000
keep up with all this stuff for

508
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,670
tv-b-gone and but I went and that's

509
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,650
where I met the Moore and Phil and I

510
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,670
think sherry if not the second Maker

511
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,770
Faire and and you know that was another

512
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,510
life-changing event where there's all

513
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,389
these people sharing their cool projects

514
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,590
openly with one another and and people

515
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,780
wanted to learn about Maya and I want to

516
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,449
learn about everyone else's and and yet

517
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,690
no one was making anything it was a

518
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,970
Maker Faire and maybe they were but I

519
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,470
didn't see it and said and then hope was

520
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,860
just a little bit later and no one was

521
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,760
making

522
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,379
anything here and so I was like hell I'm

523
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,350
gonna teach soldering I love doing that

524
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,120
and that was ten soldering irons and it

525
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,610
was mobbed and it just kind of grew from

526
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,030
there got then to event but it also

527
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,979
changed my life because you know back

528
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,350
then there really wasn't open hardware

529
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,880
to speak of and my brother is a patent

530
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,439
lawyer and what that's what one does you

531
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,440
know you're an inventor you invent

532
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,150
something you patented and and at these

533
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,010
hacker conferences and especially the

534
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,650
third one I went to or the second one I

535
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,960
went to which was in Germany put on by

536
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,280
the CCC people were enthusiastic about

537
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,200
my project but they're like what about

538
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,990
this patent thing why are you keeping

539
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,120
people from learning from and using your

540
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,350
technology it's not your technology you

541
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,668
put it out in the world it should be

542
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,860
shared with everyone why should it be

543
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,030
blocked and and I'm like really good

544
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:27,000
impression of like the CCC good work I

545
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:29,100
could put on a German ox but I'm

546
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,090
learning German I I love it over there

547
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,770
and I love the CCC and this and I want

548
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:39,090
and we're sharing even more and more as

549
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,350
time goes on but it got me to think even

550
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,790
as I'm thinking well you know I put a

551
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,500
year and a half of my life into making

552
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,360
this thing what if someone took it and

553
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,150
just made it and sold it and I'd get

554
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,229
nothing from it and I'm thinking but why

555
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,940
did I do this

556
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,710
I'm doing this because I wanted to help

557
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,540
put it a tool into the world that'll

558
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,980
help people turn TVs off and if I it's

559
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,020
patented and someone else does it

560
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,460
cheaper and better more people will be

561
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,120
doing it and that's why I'm doing this

562
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,730
to begin with

563
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,320
and it turned out and then meeting the

564
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,090
more and more was like totally

565
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,309
everything must be open source

566
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,178
yeah and I'll give you my version so

567
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,590
Mitch was in San Francisco L'Amour was

568
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,480
going to make her ferry in San Francisco

569
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,850
so I invited him both out to dinner and

570
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,040
I spent the entire night just convincing

571
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,990
Mitch to do a kit version of tv-b-gone

572
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,610
I'm just like no this is gonna work out

573
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,620
and it was peak tv-b-gone

574
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,850
and he thought it was a good idea and

575
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,918
agreed now just imagine that that was

576
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,530
all of your livelihood all of everything

577
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,030
that you all your income and in one

578
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,730
dinner after chatting with each other

579
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,370
you decided to completely open-source it

580
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,960
into a kit it made sense and and in that

581
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,520
unlocked what you wanted to do which

582
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,430
eventually to do workshops cuz you would

583
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,260
go and build

584
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,300
yeah and then teaching soldering I

585
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,390
needed a kit to do it and this is the

586
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,570
first kit along with your mini POV yeah

587
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,010
which was what your first kid yes if the

588
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,540
product number one was that many

589
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,520
possible but this was like part number

590
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,470
seven it was very early very early on

591
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,900
that I really loved it here's a question

592
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,370
if you didn't do this kit what would

593
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,770
have happened if you just ducked it

594
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,989
selling this what would have where would

595
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:12,730
you be right now oh my life wouldn't

596
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,320
have I wouldn't be here so this the

597
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,910
whole reason that I'm still making a

598
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,159
living 15 years later on this project

599
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,690
that I just made for me and turned out

600
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,420
to be popular is because it's open

601
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,980
source because I'm just a small company

602
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,860
me and twelve friends have made a living

603
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,960
from this because it's open source I

604
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,699
can't afford lots and lots of PR but

605
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,810
when someone makes this or they get down

606
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,940
with the plans and make their own

607
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,909
version I don't get a cent you don't get

608
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,070
a cent if they're not buying this kit

609
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,830
but they tell everyone they know that

610
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,659
they built this thing that this and

611
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,699
watch this and and then they they talk

612
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,250
about tv-b-gone and then way more people

613
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,570
buy my thing or this kit or whatever and

614
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,850
people find out what am i a company

615
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:57,370
about Adafruit about the whole scene and

616
00:22:51,850 --> 00:23:02,350
I can't afford that kind of PR then they

617
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,000
take it to CES and I don't know anything

618
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,919
about that

619
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,800
so someone brought a TV GaN kit when it

620
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:16,150
was brand new to CES and the secret

621
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:18,280
behind that is i soldered up five of

622
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:22,750
them and i overnighted him to one of the

623
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:26,009
Gizmodo authors and they don't care at

624
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:28,570
all he got kicked out and you turned off

625
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,879
but that's and it was interesting all

626
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,590
the coverage and outrage one person

627
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,850
somewhere they kind of followed the

628
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,820
money they're like you know that kids

629
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,990
available from Maker Shed and and

630
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,759
Adafruit and they're like I think this

631
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,190
guy Phil did that I think there's like

632
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,720
this one lone comment yeah unless out of

633
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,789
all the outrage it was one little I know

634
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,039
like I think I think they probably had a

635
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:50,980
top sales day for that kid and they did

636
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:55,049
I did for my TVB garden I got twenty

637
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,049
four thousand dollars of sales and 1200

638
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,039
yeah but this is the same organization

639
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:02,168
that on the first day of sales of

640
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:05,049
tv-b-gone the the keychain version the

641
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,690
original one they the the Gizmodo

642
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:11,918
person's started off an article saying

643
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,539
Mitch Altman is an asshole and not just

644
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,480
any kind of an asshole he goes off and

645
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:24,279
and that got me like thirty thousand

646
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:26,799
dollars in a day so you spend a lot of

647
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,049
your time doing workshops and then I

648
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,570
think the other thing and this is how

649
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:33,429
all this starts to come together

650
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,809
there wasn't things called hackerspaces

651
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,700
in the same wait so you came along I

652
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,408
think it was more of a European thing

653
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,659
there was one over there but then you

654
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,029
decided to do a hackerspace now there's

655
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,159
makerspaces

656
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:47,320
why did you do that yeah we're going to

657
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,059
hope and feeling like home in a group

658
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,710
for the first time after being excluded

659
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,230
from community all my life it's like

660
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,480
this is this is awesome I want more of

661
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,009
this and but then the conference ends

662
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,450
and then I was like but there's this one

663
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,639
in Germany and then I go there and it

664
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,759
was like this is great and then it ends

665
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:05,199
and I want more and and my third one

666
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,879
also in Germany there were people

667
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,580
talking about how to start your own

668
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:11,320
hackerspace I was like hell if there's a

669
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,939
hackerspace in my hometown I don't have

670
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,799
to wait till the next hacker conference

671
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,559
there could be community that I feel a

672
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,179
part of in my hometown we teach share

673
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,119
and do all this cool stuff that we do

674
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:25,179
here and so there were a bunch of us in

675
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,580
Germany who got together when we got

676
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,789
home in San Francisco and we also

677
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,369
encouraged each other from New York and

678
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:35,840
Washington DC folks who later started

679
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:38,299
New York our NYC resistor and act

680
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,850
see and we started the three of the

681
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:43,639
early hacker spaces in the US modeled

682
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,949
after this way open inclusive very

683
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,169
diverse groups that come together in

684
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,799
mostly Germany and all but all over

685
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:54,190
Europe and we did about by 2008 there

686
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:58,639
were these hacker spaces in the US and

687
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,350
everyone was watching us and and it was

688
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,270
amazing and people coming and visiting

689
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,209
it's like how can we do this and so we

690
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,750
started with the help of people in metal

691
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,429
lab in Austria and some other folks

692
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,700
started hackerspaces org where people

693
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,320
could collaborate and network and it

694
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,549
started proliferating within a year

695
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,340
there were a hundred more around the

696
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:21,500
u.s. a bunch more in Europe and within a

697
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,908
year after that there were 500 more and

698
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,760
it's been growing pretty much

699
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,590
exponentially ever since and I go all

700
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,629
over the world doing workshops and

701
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,330
hacker spaces are a great place to do

702
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,130
workshops and it really worked well as

703
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,840
far as just making a living as well and

704
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,580
open-source and sharing all these things

705
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,199
and kids from other people who make

706
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,449
open-source teaching people to solder

707
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,870
teaching electronics but people find out

708
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:47,090
about my livelihood tv-b-gone which they

709
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,149
like and they're supporting me doing

710
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,209
that so it's a more publicity it all

711
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:55,189
feeds in on itself and I didn't really

712
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,720
talk much about Maker Faires at the

713
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,179
early day the second Maker Faire I'm

714
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,480
doing workshops there and that one slide

715
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:06,830
that went by with Kalinga was 83 years

716
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,669
old yeah he was amazing and he'd never

717
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:14,389
made anything in his life and he was

718
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:18,080
totally into it and you know but kids

719
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:20,600
come in all sizes and ages and it's

720
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,480
totally fun doing this Maker Faire was

721
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,139
also a huge thing where I could make and

722
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:31,549
also sell kids but you know the first

723
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:35,120
kids cheap but you know it's infectious

724
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:37,129
I met people at Maker Faire and also

725
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,070
hacker conferences who they've never

726
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:42,830
made anything and I don't know what this

727
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,379
man did afterwards but people have come

728
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,480
to me who are little kids later and now

729
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,770
making a living in electronics and I

730
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,650
taught them how to solder and like

731
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,910
that's the most amazing gratifying

732
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,330
feeling ever

733
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:58,160
yeah and our time line ten-year-old kids

734
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,860
when they went to the first Maker Faire

735
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,170
are now like 25 or something you know

736
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,459
like this is just that's weird because

737
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,380
for us we're all kind of the same but

738
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,740
they're like a whole new double-sized

739
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,200
human had a full life but for us we're

740
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:15,980
just like we just gray

741
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,230
so that brings us to Maker Faire this

742
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,610
seems like it's built on top of all you

743
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,250
know the previous two folks here

744
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,080
alleviated an image so what what is it

745
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,250
like Burning Man

746
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,070
what is this thing no I mean it has a

747
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,870
spirit of Burning Man for sure but in

748
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,750
the sense that it's it's community at

749
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,330
sharing it's teaching people and it's

750
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,280
having fun you know I think the most

751
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,720
wonderful thing about Maker Faire is

752
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,460
that just all types of people come

753
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,010
together and the you know currency is

754
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,200
ideas and there's a generosity of spirit

755
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:48,050
that I don't think you find anywhere

756
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,240
else so it's really anywhere else in a

757
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,550
big community environment like that but

758
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,590
you know it I would say Maker Faire you

759
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,930
know for the past 13 years have really

760
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,399
been out there in the community trying

761
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,710
to pull people together convincing

762
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,010
people that yes you're a maker you might

763
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:06,170
do bobbin lace making you might do you

764
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,230
know robots you might do doesn't matter

765
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,700
you might do large-scale art objects but

766
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,280
it doesn't matter you share the same

767
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,490
passion about people community spirit

768
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,080
materials and open source and I'll see

769
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,330
when we started Maker Faire I mean my

770
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,790
background was primarily in book

771
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:26,629
publishing software publishing I got

772
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,920
into events after coming from as if

773
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,080
Davis and the magazine where I was

774
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,670
studying online communities which at

775
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,990
that time online communities really

776
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,990
weren't that interesting you know it was

777
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,220
a AOL prodigy CompuServe it's no great

778
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,060
we're gonna have it you know a forum or

779
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,680
a chat my first event was Java one and I

780
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,899
have to say it was really wonderful to

781
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,060
kind of come together and really figure

782
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,970
out what makes developers different and

783
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,860
how to attract and how to get them going

784
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,440
and it was like food and music and

785
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,719
gaming and different things that I was

786
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,500
able to infuse in that and through that

787
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,000
event world I really then came to kind

788
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,450
of the open source world which I have to

789
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,800
say was wild and wonderful and you know

790
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,350
I was at Ziff Davis where everything was

791
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,169
closed and proprietary as was Sun as was

792
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:15,080
Oracle as was Microsoft so having this

793
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,360
liberation and freedom to say wow this

794
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,000
is open source and actually you can kind

795
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,500
of share and at the same time different

796
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,940
things were happening I think you about

797
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,640
I don't know where your time line slide

798
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,800
is but it was kind of a perfect storm I

799
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,110
mean when did the movement start well I

800
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,230
grabbed I grabbed a couple slides here

801
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,669
and there I thought you could talk about

802
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:40,430
how many people just last year Wow yeah

803
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:43,760
I mean anyways five eight million people

804
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,900
had went to a Meg makerfaire event yeah

805
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,590
you can see the timeline at the bottom

806
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:52,070
with 2006 22,000 people yep and then

807
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:54,250
2017 1.5 yeah million people I mean

808
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,169
there are two inflection periods for me

809
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,820
you know the first from 2006 to 2009

810
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,350
honestly it was just beating on doors

811
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,470
telling people they're makers trying to

812
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,879
get sponsors we went to Austin for two

813
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,190
years which was wonderful and to go and

814
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,330
learn a new community amazing like and

815
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,360
you know and actually ran into Mitch

816
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,939
different places I think Glasgow and in

817
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,479
the UK but in 2009 we had we had a

818
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,160
recession and so that period we had to

819
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,650
say okay what are we gonna do so we

820
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,540
pulled back to one fair the bay area

821
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,100
even though Austin people seem to get it

822
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,990
but businesses and corporations just

823
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,030
still I don't think they really get the

824
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,020
importance of this movement globally but

825
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:35,480
that's another story another day in 2009

826
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,429
we got a $25,000 grant from the Kauffman

827
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,500
Foundation and we wrote a playbook

828
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,940
because everyone wanted to make her fear

829
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,290
so we said well if we're gonna do this

830
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,030
we're gonna have to figure out let's

831
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,428
give the recipe and let's give a license

832
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:49,639
to other groups to kind of get down

833
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:53,300
what's happening so we pulled back won

834
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,950
fair in 2009 in 2010 we expanded and we

835
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,350
did two different models one in New York

836
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,810
which we knew we needed to come to new

837
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,879
and we did one in Detroit and with

838
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:04,250
Detroit we partnered we actually did a

839
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,200
joint venture with the Henry Ford and in

840
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,280
the New York we partnered with a New

841
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,280
York Hall of Science

842
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,050
both were interesting the New York Hall

843
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,360
of Science has been actually an amazing

844
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:17,510
partner that events the end of September

845
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,550
at the 22nd 23rd and honestly they share

846
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,650
the same passion and the same drive the

847
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:24,379
same you know getting kids hands-on and

848
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,000
in Detroit was interesting too and in

849
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,820
fact Detroit's gone on to be its own

850
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,170
license but 2009 was important and

851
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,169
that's when this licensing program

852
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,610
started and then 2014 when we went to

853
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,050
the White House which you know I

854
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,260
probably didn't even really appreciate

855
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:42,129
it as much as I do now because we had

856
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,570
unfortunately we aligned with three

857
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,580
objectives from the White House so

858
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,070
veterans retraining workforce

859
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,710
development and STEM education and we

860
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,600
had a lot of the forces you know in the

861
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,080
Office of Science and Technology Policy

862
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,240
program Tom Kalil scroop helping kind of

863
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,250
infuse this out into the world and those

864
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,470
were really that was important even

865
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,150
globally you know as we all know

866
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,370
especially even after this last week a

867
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,440
lot of folks a lot of countries look and

868
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,969
see what's happening in the US and or

869
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,790
any of those maker programs going on

870
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,920
anymore yeah oh absolutely so the two

871
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,300
largest you know and again I'm gonna say

872
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,590
maker fear people you know you want to

873
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,480
look at numbers and actually this is an

874
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,560
ice hockey stick growth but I'm gonna

875
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,750
say some of the best makerfaire

876
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,000
experiences are the small ones they

877
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,920
don't have to be big you know sometimes

878
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,740
being Vegas more complicated but it you

879
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,750
know it's good for press but some of the

880
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,190
small maker fears are really important

881
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,590
and they're happening all over the world

882
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,870
which is really wonderful

883
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,730
Rome there I think that they'll be on

884
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:45,110
their eighth event this year they

885
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:48,620
started in 2010 so now 2013 so sorry

886
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,120
yes yeah six of them and they're they're

887
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,500
actually doing quite well they worked

888
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,149
with the European Commission which

889
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,700
started a European maker week and I

890
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,350
think probably miss you probably have

891
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,650
seen some of the things in Europe around

892
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,000
there and then Shenzhen has been really

893
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,490
important as well and I think many of

894
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,710
you probably have been there and you

895
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,040
know it's actually the other interesting

896
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:11,639
thing that comes out of this is this

897
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,560
national community that goes you know

898
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,929
it's just so impactful and so powerful

899
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,730
that you can pretty much reach out to

900
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,350
anyone at any time of the day to

901
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,530
actually get any answer to any question

902
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:24,839
that you have solved so this growth is

903
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:27,390
it's interesting it's gonna be you know

904
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,820
where does it go from here and you know

905
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,259
that's gonna be the next step and Maker

906
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,810
Faires I mean it's interesting cornfield

907
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,550
electronics I came from Ohio so I

908
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,500
modeled Maker Faire after the Lorraine

909
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,230
county fair because I loved going to the

910
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,630
fair as a child like can once you know

911
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,949
once a year in the summer you see things

912
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,950
and I think that that's what's so

913
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,299
wonderful about the kids any age that

914
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,100
that come to a Maker Faire it's just

915
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,630
that gives them ideas and they can hope

916
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,060
and they can dream and you know they can

917
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,500
go home and mash things up and you know

918
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,390
probably for a week or two it's pretty

919
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,040
crazy around their house as they're

920
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,720
looking for more things to do around the

921
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,700
year and I think kind of year-round

922
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,509
making and programming and getting it

923
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,879
into schools

924
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,680
there's also another real key thing so

925
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,540
and so for over ten years

926
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,770
you ran these maker fairs but oh yeah

927
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,300
there's everything you know actually for

928
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,940
thirteen years straight I thought about

929
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,140
it 24/7 you know how are we gonna are we

930
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,420
gonna grow it how we're gonna push it

931
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,920
how are we gonna include communities

932
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,020
getting more women getting more diverse

933
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,750
groups involved in making has always

934
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,920
been the first year actually we did have

935
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,660
making the first year we had Wendy

936
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,010
Tremaine with swapper Rama Rama which

937
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,200
was probably the smartest thing we ever

938
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,810
did which just get to families I mean we

939
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,730
made some assumptions that a maker you

940
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,620
know and most of makes audience at that

941
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,140
time and we started Maker Faire for a

942
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,700
festival to celebrate makers most of his

943
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,850
audience at that time was real it was

944
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,950
male and what we really wanted to do is

945
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,390
say well you know these males probably

946
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,129
have families and those families

947
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,740
probably care about the same things that

948
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:57,990
might manifest in a different format so

949
00:35:52,740 --> 00:36:01,439
you know 13 years later yeah yeah and

950
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:03,720
that was one of the reasons when we put

951
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,240
together the text for this panel I was

952
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,399
getting nervous that you were getting

953
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,660
erased out of the maker movement sherry

954
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,460
because there's these books that come

955
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,720
out maker manifesto maker this every

956
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,700
there's like five different magazines

957
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,290
that have the word making it now and I

958
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,000
kept seeing father of the maker move in

959
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,410
all these you know I was around the

960
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,090
beginning like all these things but I

961
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,990
didn't see your name anywhere so I just

962
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,030
wanted to like

963
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:30,660
one say Thank You Shari for all of the

964
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:32,130
Maker Faires for the last 13 years seems

965
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,618
like they just sort of happened but it's

966
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,570
just intense amazing amounts of work an

967
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,580
organization that you and your team have

968
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,050
done it no absolutely and you know and I

969
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,420
didn't do it alone I mean certainly

970
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,500
Lewis Glasgow is our show producer who's

971
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,510
been there from the beginning

972
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,450
Bridget vanderlyn is there from the

973
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,830
beginning doing community and

974
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,230
programming and Jonathan and the list

975
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,000
goes on and on it's certainly it's an

976
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,589
effort that involves a lot of folks but

977
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,970
it's finding like the potential it's

978
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,040
finding you know the seeds in the

979
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,540
community I don't know if Nick normals

980
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,210
here but Nick was actually one of our

981
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,310
first community evangelist to go out and

982
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,200
actually find makers and tell people

983
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,150
yeah you're a maker you know and a lot

984
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,649
of times it's just really telling people

985
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,359
and giving them permission to say yeah

986
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,680
you're a maker you didn't have to go to

987
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,730
college you didn't have to do anything

988
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,299
you just have to be passionate about

989
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,980
something and willing to share and so we

990
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,210
spent a lot of time kind of heads down

991
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,800
and literally 24/7 for sure that's it's

992
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,210
great actually they Adam you know

993
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,119
actually Phil if you go back to the Adam

994
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:33,210
Savage one I'll say Adam has also been

995
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,160
another person you know it's so great

996
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,230
Adam comes to the Bay Area Maker Faire

997
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,450
every Sunday we try to like do something

998
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,280
we say as a Sunday sermon but here's a

999
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,520
guy - that's out there just really

1000
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,320
inspiring people of all ages and there's

1001
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,599
a new show MythBusters junior and I'm

1002
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,190
pretty sure every sing in there kids and

1003
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,570
then there's Adam Savage I'm pretty sure

1004
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,000
every single one of them is a Maker

1005
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,170
Faire kid there's yeah they all got

1006
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,460
their start and they've only known a

1007
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,950
world because I think they're all under

1008
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,050
13 they've only known a world with make

1009
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,669
and making and I'll tell you we actually

1010
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,670
spent a lot of time and even money I'm

1011
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,320
trying to do things like recycling and

1012
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,280
we brought in different groups and you

1013
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,670
know we really felt that it was

1014
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,230
important to practice what we preach so

1015
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,700
I'm really optimistic about the kids

1016
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,670
that are coming out you know in their

1017
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,500
20s right now and well you know I'm

1018
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,150
excited about seeing where they're going

1019
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,089
to take this and how they can make it

1020
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:26,460
365 days a year there was I remember the

1021
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:29,339
Baker Ferry the first day was actually

1022
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,200
for schools there was a secret gay yeah

1023
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,820
we turned through education day and

1024
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,609
actually it's really fun to watch that

1025
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,950
being kind

1026
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,480
played out internationally even one of

1027
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,399
the things we do is a Maker dinner I

1028
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,660
mean I'm so gracious for the makers that

1029
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,670
come and give their time over the

1030
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,870
weekend they're not getting paid they're

1031
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,850
there because they love it and they're

1032
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,529
there because they want to share and one

1033
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,900
a very good friend of mine Gerard who

1034
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,850
has done pea for us in the Bay Area and

1035
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,500
we bring them we bring them around you

1036
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,360
know I love seeing it like the pea

1037
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,000
version or the maker dinner version like

1038
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,010
in Nantes France being played out so

1039
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,840
some of these traditions are really

1040
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,300
important blue ribbons you know another

1041
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,830
thing which again acknowledging making

1042
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,660
sure that my team got to get out and

1043
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,130
talk to the makers you know again that's

1044
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,710
one thing to do and produce the event

1045
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,300
but you know stuff and kind of you know

1046
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,280
appreciate what's happening there so

1047
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,200
little things like blue ribbons or

1048
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,780
little acknowledgments hence a nod back

1049
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,549
to the old County Fair kind of a really

1050
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,010
key and again we're all kind of people

1051
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,960
and I don't know it's just kind of fun

1052
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,670
and as you probably feel just being here

1053
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,080
talking to other people and that human

1054
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,720
side of everything that's really

1055
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,810
important all right and I know there's

1056
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,180
gonna be questions at the end it's a

1057
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,990
11:41 so I think we have to start up

1058
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,660
with questions too but I have some

1059
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,049
questions first first ones free image I

1060
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,670
know

1061
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,400
so Noisebridge is getting kicked out of

1062
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,230
the current space what do you what type

1063
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,450
of help do you need or what could

1064
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,390
because this is kind of how help happens

1065
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,980
you put a flag out and help what could

1066
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,020
what could people do is there a

1067
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,990
fundraising thing there is a space thing

1068
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,910
what what do you need to keep this is it

1069
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,279
historic landmark yet I mean I feel like

1070
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,549
it should be people who have looked into

1071
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,670
that but the building itself has to be

1072
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:12,400
the historic and it's not an historic

1073
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,800
building so at least in San Francisco so

1074
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,470
that's not gonna happen but yeah we're

1075
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,630
after being in our current space for 10

1076
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,160
years the Landlord and San Francisco's

1077
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,660
out of control

1078
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,060
isn't there some billionaire that can

1079
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,640
just put it in a submarine or like a lot

1080
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,529
of rocket or something like yeah we can

1081
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,910
have an inappropriate submarine at noise

1082
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,500
bridge well as well as anywhere else in

1083
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,060
the world so just every other day

1084
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,150
there's like next billionaire like what

1085
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,560
or you know everyone's everything's IPI

1086
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,160
isn't there like a scooter company that

1087
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
can just like

1088
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,990
yeah well if anyone knows of any

1089
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,670
millionaires scooter companies that want

1090
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,339
to help out Noisebridge send them our

1091
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:52,160
way just noise brunette has a lot of

1092
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,560
info on that we are we got a reprieve

1093
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,450
will but get to stay in our place

1094
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,100
another year but no matter what we do

1095
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,169
we're gonna have to double our income

1096
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,200
and that's the most challenging thing

1097
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,820
we're doing fundraising so we can buy a

1098
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,419
place hopefully so we don't have to go

1099
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,460
through this again and but what do we do

1100
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,430
like how do we stay a group that we want

1101
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,620
to be while doubling our income in order

1102
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,629
to pay for doubling our expenses and

1103
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,520
that's an ongoing discussion that anyone

1104
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,840
can be part of because we're an

1105
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,000
anarchist group where everyone's welcome

1106
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,140
yeah if you wanted to double your

1107
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,480
revenue you wouldn't be a hackerspace

1108
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,100
like that's not that's not the Charter

1109
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,970
like let's go make a ton of money that

1110
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,500
would just be a company

1111
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,799
yeah we're not there to make money but

1112
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,440
we need money defer for rent and for

1113
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,750
cleaning two cleaning products for

1114
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,220
cleaning our toilets but so you need a

1115
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,570
new space and there's some fundraising

1116
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,560
so people could check out noise and

1117
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,840
noise bridge I can add that that's

1118
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,330
that's of course the top of our page now

1119
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,470
but you know again I mean we just want

1120
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,150
to continue to be a space where people

1121
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,390
can come and teach and share and learn

1122
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,260
when be part of open friendly community

1123
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,520
okay

1124
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,610
so sure you're out of the maker fair

1125
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,770
game you're done for now you're out I'm

1126
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,450
I'm kind of taking a break I'm doing

1127
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,590
what I'm calling independent studies and

1128
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,379
working with a lot of different maker

1129
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:08,840
groups so everything from drones to

1130
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,210
wearables to Gerard helping him launch

1131
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,890
his restaurant and just kind of taking a

1132
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,740
break to figure out where this is all

1133
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,540
going because things are changing I mean

1134
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,080
I think we see that every day yeah so

1135
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,460
right now what what is the challenge for

1136
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,230
large-scale events that bring people

1137
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,060
together because every day is pretty

1138
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,700
much how do you divide people yeah

1139
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,529
like that's the game you know for Maker

1140
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,089
Faire it's always been kind of a sponsor

1141
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,210
you know it's been 50/50 kind of

1142
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:36,890
attendee revenue and sponsor supported

1143
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,030
it may make a little money but it's you

1144
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,190
know nothing for the amount of work that

1145
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,050
goes into it and usually those dollars

1146
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,030
go right back into another program I

1147
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,310
think the big thing is getting sponsors

1148
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,630
on board or to help fund this I mean

1149
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,009
again it's not a lot of money that's

1150
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,740
needed it's the same thing that

1151
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,280
feels this isn't huge dollars who we're

1152
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,799
looking for

1153
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,050
but or that you know makes looking for

1154
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,460
but I really think getting large

1155
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,290
corporations who by the way I've

1156
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,390
co-opted the word maker and everything

1157
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,040
in fact one of my friends just showed me

1158
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:06,109
some pictures that I sent to the sales

1159
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,970
team on vans she said you know here's

1160
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,410
the shoe for a maker there's a Nissan

1161
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,319
commercial it's like you're a maker buy

1162
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:14,029
a Nissan it's so what I know I swear

1163
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,530
that that was a commercial like you you

1164
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,800
like to make and here's the new Nissan

1165
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,000
that so it's coffee from makers yeah

1166
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,060
yeah so I wish that those companies

1167
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,440
would kind of step forward and you know

1168
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,150
and help kind of support this because it

1169
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,620
really is good and again it doesn't have

1170
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,500
to be as big and it doesn't have to be

1171
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,990
crazy expensive they can be in different

1172
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,090
groups but it's important it really is

1173
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,950
okay and then free later what are the

1174
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,640
next things that you're working on in

1175
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,350
the world of community and sharing and

1176
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,600
hardware I think the most interesting

1177
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,549
thing for me is just how to get more

1178
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,740
people to do what we're doing basically

1179
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,660
cloning Adafruit to make more of them I

1180
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,729
think it's it's hard to do a business

1181
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,200
but I'd love to see more open-source

1182
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,850
Hardware more makers and I think it's

1183
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,040
it's neat when we see young people you

1184
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,870
know again who or when ten years ago

1185
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,790
they were you know preteens and now

1186
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,750
they're graduating with electro

1187
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,920
engineering degrees and hopefully

1188
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,420
they'll take the kind of values that

1189
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,430
we're sharing with the world and bring

1190
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,570
them into you know whether they work at

1191
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,520
a company or whether they start their

1192
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,220
own company or do consulting or stay in

1193
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,840
academia well I want to keep this meme

1194
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,270
of open-source hardware and sharing

1195
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,980
harder designs alive I think I think

1196
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,600
it's never been a better time there's so

1197
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,420
much social media we might as well use

1198
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,170
it to share files and documentation you

1199
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:35,960
can use social media for good things

1200
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:38,840
well I just want to say it if you have a

1201
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,000
job you don't like quit and do something

1202
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,410
worthwhile we have many models to draw

1203
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,520
from now

1204
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,109
[Music]

1205
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,400
and we're gonna open up for questions

1206
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,440
now I guess the last thing is we are

1207
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,690
what we celebrate and so if you're a

1208
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,500
publisher if you're a person who just

1209
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,760
happens to be on Twitter and it's not

1210
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,230
all it doesn't have to be all for

1211
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,610
complaining and saying things are

1212
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,520
terrible you can use it for other stuff

1213
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,620
and if you want to see cool folks like

1214
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,960
this in the world celebrate them make

1215
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,759
sure they're not erased out of history

1216
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,230
if they have products support them if

1217
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,960
they have events go to them if they have

1218
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:16,240
kits pick one up that's the best way

1219
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,950
that we can all keep doing this so but

1220
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,629
he felt before questions I actually want

1221
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,600
to also give kudos to Phil because

1222
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:25,270
Phil's work hours and hours behind the

1223
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,480
scene he's been a great when I first met

1224
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:29,920
him I thought this blog thing really but

1225
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,560
I've enjoyed collaborating with Phil

1226
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,830
over the years he's got a crazy

1227
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,570
wonderful mind he knows how to connect

1228
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,549
with lots of different groups and again

1229
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,960
a lot of this is why we're all here too

1230
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,650
is because of you so thank you for that

1231
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,769
yeah

1232
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,769
[Music]

1233
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:53,260
I just work here all right questions I

1234
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,509
have I have two questions I like your

1235
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,030
comments on either the bankruptcy of

1236
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,400
TechShop which happened this year

1237
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,250
despite yet what seems to be great

1238
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,530
increase in in the population doing

1239
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,180
making and also on the Fablab movement

1240
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,200
if you have any

1241
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,899
Babla consortium if you have any

1242
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,520
comments I'll take the tech shop one so

1243
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,290
I put on my journalist hat once in a

1244
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,360
while and I covered that so it seems

1245
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,220
like it was just mismanaged with all the

1246
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,580
money they were spending more than they

1247
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,529
were making and they opened up one in

1248
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,960
New York and then two weeks later they

1249
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,700
closed it down and employees we're told

1250
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,230
over email I think hey it's closed and

1251
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,089
so people have moved out they moved

1252
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,970
their entire lives I think transparency

1253
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:35,710
within organizations if if if you work

1254
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,540
at a company and there's no way to find

1255
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,310
out how much you're spending for so much

1256
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,680
you're making it's it's not good for

1257
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,570
lots of reasons maybe the owners of the

1258
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,710
company are siphon it off that happens a

1259
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:49,210
lot maybe they're not making a lot of

1260
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:51,160
money lots of venture capital was poured

1261
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:53,680
in and it was just impossible for it to

1262
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,509
make money so for that one it it might

1263
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,960
be a good idea to do something like tech

1264
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:01,300
shop and now there's another version of

1265
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,560
it that I think is open it's like shop

1266
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:07,000
build and and who knows but that's the

1267
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,529
just answer the question they just spent

1268
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,880
more than they made and eventually like

1269
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,430
you can't make payroll and then it's

1270
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,290
over for the Fablab movement that's more

1271
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,210
of an academic one a L'Amour that

1272
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,470
started MIT a little more probably has

1273
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,270
some comments on that remember that guy

1274
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:21,399
Saul Griffith his group the Center for

1275
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,920
bits and atoms that Professor Neil

1276
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,470
Gershenfeld was the presser who sort of

1277
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,460
started writing about and creating fab

1278
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:32,980
labs so it's not a coincidence the the

1279
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,570
idea of makerspaces and building stuff

1280
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,160
and the stuff that's being built in fab

1281
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,580
labs you look at the documentation for

1282
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,910
fab labs they use a lot of like the kits

1283
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,080
that Mitch and I design and people that

1284
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,149
Harvard groups didn't they do Arduino

1285
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,160
and they do programming so I think fab

1286
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,010
labs again it it's a more academic they

1287
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,960
tend to get grants to open them but they

1288
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,180
mirror the same ideas maker system they

1289
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,270
take but no take they borrow and give

1290
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,000
ideas from the community one makerspaces

1291
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,100
I think if you have

1292
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,780
a grant you can open up a Fablab that's

1293
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,270
amazing you're gonna get like a really

1294
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,040
sweet organizing organization you're

1295
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:12,000
gonna work with schools I think that

1296
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,610
there's also an area for community led

1297
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,220
maker spaces that also work with schools

1298
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,870
and and borrow some the ideas of that

1299
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,520
Fab Lab but maybe have a slightly

1300
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:22,589
different twist I think some of the

1301
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,060
stuff that happens in maker spaces like

1302
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,220
lock-picking wouldn't necessarily make

1303
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,140
it in a Fab Lab but some things like 3d

1304
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,230
printing are in both so it's it's

1305
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,690
definitely a inorganic give-and-take

1306
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,160
between making and fab labs they've got

1307
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,690
less overlap there yeah there's not like

1308
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,980
a competition like who can make more I

1309
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,710
think it's like we're doing the same

1310
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,570
thing okay next question I'm the father

1311
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,310
of two sons twelve and fourteen and

1312
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,170
they've participated in maker activities

1313
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,779
and so I have to tell you your stuff is

1314
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,640
really really important and my question

1315
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,250
is this has there been any interest in

1316
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,770
looping in to the maker act to maker

1317
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,140
events the do-it-yourself repair

1318
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,960
community and teaching people to repair

1319
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,120
and the tools and the the wherewithal of

1320
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,400
learning to repair things whatever it

1321
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,290
may be and also maybe even establishing

1322
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,940
like repair competitions where things

1323
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,860
are deliberately broken and you have to

1324
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,120
figure out what's wrong and fix it I'm

1325
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,680
just wondering if there's been much

1326
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,720
interest in that area there maybe I

1327
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,730
don't know there's a lot of interest in

1328
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,890
that all over the world now there's

1329
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:22,230
fix-it cafes there you've often called

1330
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,299
and they often happen at hacker spaces

1331
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,570
and it's promoted there Noisebridge

1332
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,400
has a few people but one in particular

1333
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,620
which really pushes people to come and

1334
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,670
bring things that everyone can help each

1335
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:38,940
other fix it so but if you the idea is

1336
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:41,160
you just brought up our grade so either

1337
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,630
go to your local hackerspace and make it

1338
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,149
happen cuz that's the only way things

1339
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,800
happen or start a hackerspace make it

1340
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,780
happen or just start a fix-it cafe and

1341
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,280
make it happen please do it you know

1342
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,290
you've got the energy you get the ideas

1343
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,710
you can collect other people around you

1344
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:58,620
and make it happen sure you what was was

1345
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:00,600
iFixit doing a fair you know absolutely

1346
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,279
I would say you know and actually we

1347
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,690
even started early days with something

1348
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,000
called make play day which was a take

1349
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,130
apart electronics area it was it was

1350
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,210
great I Triple E hoped and you know

1351
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,250
pulling in the community

1352
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,900
and then it just became one of those

1353
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,490
things that was hard to hard to manage

1354
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,599
but seriously most people have things

1355
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,700
that you could probably take apart at

1356
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,140
home anyway that aren't working but I

1357
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,730
fix it definitely and I've seen

1358
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,828
internationally to traveling that

1359
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,420
there's a lot of fix a it fixer

1360
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:25,920
collectives than that but there could be

1361
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,369
a bigger spotlight on it you're right

1362
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,950
about that

1363
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,690
sure a part of it is getting consumers

1364
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:32,808
used to their right to repair I mean

1365
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,640
we're all getting told it's a it's a

1366
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:38,430
black square that you can never open up

1367
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,990
so I think all of us can make sure we

1368
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,399
get the word out that it's not not only

1369
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,959
is it good for the environment but it's

1370
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,099
good for skills like taking apart

1371
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,990
something and fixing and putting it back

1372
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:47,880
together that's a good population to

1373
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:50,098
have instead of just showing up at the

1374
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:55,050
Apple Store to get keyboard replaced and

1375
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:56,819
it's fun yeah excessing hi um I'm Evelyn

1376
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,619
I'm based in Montreal and I'd like to

1377
00:50:56,819 --> 00:51:01,259
really really thank you for the panel

1378
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,839
for sharing all this with us I'm a sound

1379
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,270
artist I work with kids in a non-profit

1380
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,279
and we are starting to do our own

1381
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:12,839
versions of some of those kids and also

1382
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,359
evaluating the possibility of joining an

1383
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,099
art gallery as a second space so we can

1384
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,660
do like a commune lab so that was

1385
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:21,210
something I wanted to mention to Mitch

1386
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,180
you might want to look into doing an art

1387
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:28,410
and hacker space together it's pretty

1388
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:31,618
cool I had a question for ladyada so I

1389
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:33,390
saw those really cool machines and I was

1390
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:35,040
wondering if you if one of the

1391
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,259
motivations on getting all these

1392
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,900
machines and manufacturing your kits

1393
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,720
here was for ethics reasons and if you

1394
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,880
have problems with you know ethics and

1395
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,910
sourcing in China and if there's

1396
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,040
anything that we can do to be able to

1397
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,140
produce our own kits without having to

1398
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,779
source in you know already super

1399
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,118
polluted parts of the world and this is

1400
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,109
something that you would know a lot

1401
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,700
about this so I'm going to differ

1402
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:02,190
and I'll answer sensors not only in you

1403
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,230
but um you know when I when I bought

1404
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,420
machine the machinery to build low

1405
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,650
tracks honestly to start because it was

1406
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,010
running a company it was just the most

1407
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,869
efficient way to make sure that I had

1408
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,579
the manufacturing time ability like

1409
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:17,010
often when you send things out you're

1410
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,900
scheduled maybe six to eight weeks with

1411
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,750
out with other companies other people

1412
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,030
who are renting

1413
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,290
time on those machines essentially we

1414
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,360
were making so much that made sense for

1415
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:28,210
me to just buy it and have the quality

1416
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,870
control in-house which to me worked out

1417
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,430
really well

1418
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,680
but you know one of the cool things

1419
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,379
about Hylian company is like Phil

1420
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,660
mentioned when you run a company you

1421
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:41,050
want it the way you want to there's no

1422
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:44,109
one rule set so if I want to have paid

1423
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:46,330
family leave if I want to have election

1424
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:48,970
day be a day off those are decisions

1425
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,680
that I can make as like the leader of

1426
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,959
the company and you know my idea of what

1427
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,210
is good for the company is what I can

1428
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,710
decide to do and being independent is

1429
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,360
part of that if you're independent you

1430
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,800
can make the decisions if you have

1431
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,720
venture capital or if you're owned by

1432
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,890
another company you often don't get to

1433
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,259
make the decisions but about

1434
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,670
manufacturing in China you actually do a

1435
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,550
lot of that you talk to me about it you

1436
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:10,870
want to mention a little bit yeah so we

1437
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,460
don't we don't have time anymore

1438
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:14,319
I don't your factory in China but there

1439
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:17,320
are really good manufacturers in China

1440
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,810
that don't pollute and don't and treat

1441
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,550
their people well and it you you have to

1442
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,400
go to China to check them out though and

1443
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,840
that's what I did before I hired any

1444
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,010
it's important that people if you're

1445
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,600
trying to make the world a better place

1446
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:31,970
you don't do that at the expense of

1447
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:38,299
others okay all right

1448
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:38,299
[Applause]
