2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,810
welcome

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,798
we don't have an emcee at the moment so

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,389
I'll just mention if you need the

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,000
bathroom keys they're over by the mixer

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,700
and I'm gonna talk this morning about

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,170
basement MEMS I think it turns out if

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,850
you put basement in the title of your

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,480
talk you end up down here so thank thank

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,230
you for finding it what I meant by

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,099
basement was I was very inspired by the

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,290
sort of garage biotech folks epic and

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,210
approach to life of buying up old

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,860
surplus industrial equipment and trying

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,540
to do cool things with it that are maybe

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,239
what the manufacturer intended and maybe

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,600
not quite and I wanted to apply that to

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,000
making small parts out of silicon so

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,699
what I came up with was this basement

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,430
MEMS setup it's still very much a work

21
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,899
in project process but it gives an

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,210
opportunity to talk about lasers

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,510
kilowatt radio transmitters dangerous

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,880
chemicals racks of compressed gases and

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,158
turbo molecular vacuum pumps and really

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,199
a I think the best opportunity I've

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,250
found thus far in my life to build up my

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,009
collection of esoteric plumbing fittings

29
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,380
so I'm gonna talk mostly about the

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,759
processes and equipment because probably

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,220
most of you don't want to make exactly

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,570
the same stuff that I want to make

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,220
that's one reason the other reason is

34
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,669
this is still as I said a work in

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,890
process and I haven't frankly made that

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,630
many successful things so I think it's

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,450
gonna be interesting to talk about how

38
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,610
the stuff is made what kind of stuff you

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,560
need to do it and what the processes

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,409
look like so I think all good projects

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,229
start with some kind of weird obsession

42
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,970
for me of its mechanical watches I

43
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,009
really have been spending a few years

44
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,579
trying to figure out how to make all of

45
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,530
the parts one of the more interesting I

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,270
think advances in the field in the last

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,549
few years is making parts out of silicon

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,200
and it has some advantages it's

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,700
completely anti magnetic it has some

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,710
cool physical properties and you can

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,360
make really any geometry you can think

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,660
of kind of in the same way you can make

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
things out of 3d printing

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,880
but backwards because you're removing

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,750
stuff a very small amount at a time and

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,750
so a traditional mechanical watch this

57
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,820
is kind of the heart of it you've got a

58
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,780
balance wheel a hair spring a pellet

59
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,070
fork and a escape wheel and this moves

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,450
back and forth and what a mechanical

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,310
watch does is it counts how many times

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,290
it moves back and forth this is a very

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,820
traditional design they've been made

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,760
this way since late 1600s this is a more

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,380
modern design made out of silicon and

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,940
this is just a hair spring made out of

67
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,380
silicon so I want to sort of get into

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,579
that space be able to play with those

69
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,340
kinds of parts shapes ideas I'm not so

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,980
much trying to make transistors a lot of

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,600
these stuff that a lot of the tools

72
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,100
techniques processes that I'll be

73
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,019
talking about can be applied to that and

74
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,090
I'll have some links at the end to

75
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,650
people who are doing that and applying

76
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,070
this kind of stuff toward making more

77
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,010
electronics oriented things and so we'll

78
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,230
get to that so the starting point is how

79
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,239
do you go from a silicon wafer to a

80
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:24,090
finished part and the process is you

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,010
design your part you get some silicon

82
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,200
wafers you put down a pattern on the

83
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,970
wafer that represents either what you

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,350
want to make or the opposite of what you

85
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,300
want to make the negative image of it

86
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,010
you etch away the part of the stuff that

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,870
you don't want and then you have to do

88
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,519
some some post-processing to cut out the

89
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,440
parts and attach wires if you're

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,970
attaching wires so this is good for

91
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,760
making small physical components gears

92
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,040
watch parts pressure sensors that kind

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,299
of stuff also good for making

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,650
semiconductors if you sort of repeat

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,910
some of those steps a few times so

96
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,140
rather than doing one layer you're

97
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,230
building up multiple layers with

98
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,760
different materials the tools and

99
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,170
processes can also be used for making

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,359
things for micro fluidics

101
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,130
for plasma nitriding if you want to get

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,350
that cool gold color on your cutting

103
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,299
tools for vacuum heat treating for all

104
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,030
kinds of other kinds of geeky things

105
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:17,579
that can be a good part of your project

106
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,289
okay so the first step is lithography

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,630
you start out with your substrate your

108
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:23,610
silicon wafer your your quartz way for

109
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,719
whatever you're using you put a layer of

110
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,850
stuff on top of it

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,510
and that's called the resist usually a

112
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,840
photoresist a photosensitive resist and

113
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,620
much like developing film in a darkroom

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,570
you expose it to light but you filter

115
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,010
some of that light through a mask so the

116
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,750
light doesn't hit the entire sub the

117
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,539
entire photosensitive substrate it just

118
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,300
hits some parts of it you develop it and

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,430
then the etching process will etch away

120
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,670
material below the parts that you've

121
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,010
left so you make a mask that exposes the

122
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,930
parts that you want to etch away you

123
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,150
then use various processes that can be a

124
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,890
wet chemical process or a dry etching

125
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,989
process we'll get into a little bit of

126
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,880
that to get rid of the parts that you

127
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,860
don't want once you finished them in my

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,170
case I'm pretty much done I've got the

129
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,120
part that I wanted for a lot of other

130
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,340
processes you might then lay down a

131
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,919
layer of metal over the top you'd use a

132
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,570
different mask and start again

133
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,500
I guess is as simple as a way to do this

134
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,430
that I found I should mention I'm

135
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,010
completely an amateur at this

136
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,750
they do professional engineering in

137
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,370
completely different areas but this is

138
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,979
very much a hobby project so this is

139
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,630
something I'm playing around but if any

140
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,760
of you happen to be experts in the areas

141
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,530
please jump up and let me know better

142
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,570
ways to do things but that you see is

143
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,719
any absolute easiest way that I found to

144
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,870
do this is there are photos there are

145
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,510
film photo recess that you can get they

146
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,130
are a layer of the chemical photoresist

147
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,110
sandwiched between two plastic layers

148
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,789
you peel off the bottom plastic you

149
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,880
stick it down to whatever you want to

150
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,740
edge you bake it on on a hot plate you

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,860
peel off the top layer I'm sorry you

152
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,180
expose it through your mask then you

153
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,900
peel off the top layer and you're good

154
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,280
to go there's much more complicated ways

155
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,799
of laying down a layer of photoresist

156
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,479
I'll talk about in a second and there

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,729
are much more complicated ways of

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:26,820
exposing it this is as I said the simple

159
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,800
way so that the mask that you can kind

160
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,740
of see there this is an exposure gauge

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,780
so I'm just trying out this little box

162
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,289
that I built for exposing it's a 3 watt

163
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,320
UV LED in a little foam core and gaff

164
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,840
tape box to hold it about the right

165
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,880
distance above the thing it's not

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,789
perfectly collimated by any means you're

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,840
not going to be making you know Intel

168
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:53,669
processor not even a 404 on this thing

169
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,049
but for first starting out forget for

170
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,030
trying things out you don't need

171
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,150
anything more than this a source of UV

172
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:03,059
light and a place to put it the exposure

173
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,130
gauge it gives you a way of telling how

174
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,229
exposed the resist is you want to get it

175
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,810
just right so that the exposed parts

176
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,539
tape stuck on and hard enough to resist

177
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,099
your chemicals and the other parts get

178
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,919
washed away so that the substrate is

179
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,840
exposed so here are two exposures once

180
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,180
30 seconds one 60 seconds and you can

181
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,039
see kind of a difference and you want it

182
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,039
to and kind of in the middle there

183
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm using a really simple timer here I

184
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,930
really like using arduino z' for most

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,479
things but frankly it was cheaper to use

186
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,490
the surplus little timer than to buy and

187
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,930
heard we know its relay and then set it

188
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,970
up a lot of one of the recurring themes

189
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,710
here is going to be trying to reuse and

190
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:51,150
and do things as inexpensively as

191
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,270
possible so if you don't want to use the

192
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,620
film photoresist either because there's

193
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,780
only a couple of different formulations

194
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,610
available of it they aren't suitable for

195
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,429
all chemical processes you might want to

196
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,129
do you can get all kinds of liquid photo

197
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,810
resists and you can make your own you

198
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,909
can buy very expensive bottles of it

199
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,009
most of the commercial suppliers are

200
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,599
going to give you a quote like three to

201
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,310
five hundred dollars for a couple

202
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,840
hundred milliliters and tell you to

203
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,979
store it at negative twenty degrees

204
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,729
Celsius and use it within three months

205
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:25,378
I'm not going to do that the there's

206
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,060
much simpler ways of making it that you

207
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,569
can find out if you you know use your

208
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,000
favorite search engine they work pretty

209
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:37,380
well for a lot of chemistry's another

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,510
kind of recurring theme is that the

211
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,088
processes that I'm using come from

212
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,218
semiconductor manufacturing Moore's law

213
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,110
tells us that semiconducting

214
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,420
manufacturing advances really rapidly

215
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,600
the hardware the techniques the

216
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,430
processes change pretty often and so

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,899
there's a huge secondary market of old

218
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,750
equipment most of which is really high

219
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,940
quality is really actually fun to work

220
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,149
with because it was designed and built

221
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,620
to be repaired maintained to be very

222
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:12,000
high reliability in ways that most

223
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,620
consumer electronics just aren't and so

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,959
a lot of what I've tried to do is sort

225
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,880
of take and adaptively reuse that so

226
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,500
here's a commercial spin coater what

227
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,120
this does is when you're using a liquid

228
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,670
photoresist you take your substrate

229
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,709
which is usually roughly circular with

230
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,899
one flat edge you spin it really fast

231
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:31,319
you drop a drop of liquid in the middle

232
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,850
and it just kind of flattens out and by

233
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,980
controlling the speed that you spin it

234
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,449
the acceleration and D acceleration and

235
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,379
the amount of liquid you drop you can

236
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,608
control the thickness

237
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:44,669
of the surf of the resist layer these

238
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:47,879
are still pretty expensive but our

239
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:50,819
available use I'm building my own using

240
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:54,419
a I've got a couple versions one is

241
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:57,779
using a surplus spindle motor out of a

242
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,939
commercial machine the other is using

243
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,639
just a couple bearings and a design from

244
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:05,699
a bunch of woodworkers who are building

245
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,189
vacuum chucks and it works works well

246
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:11,669
enough for my purposes this one it's

247
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:14,129
it's a two phase AC motor because I

248
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,220
don't know that's what they had in 1975

249
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:18,959
and they were building it the best way

250
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,089
that I found to control that is actually

251
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,128
a stepper motor driver running on

252
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,289
microstepping mode which has two phases

253
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:27,479
and tries to approximate a sine wave and

254
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:28,919
microstepping and it it works well

255
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,629
enough and it spins the motor at the

256
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,179
speeds I need accelerates D accelerates

257
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:35,009
well and then to drop the liquid

258
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,389
photopolymer on there's an open-source

259
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,799
3d printable syringe pump which works

260
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,989
very well to hold a one milliliter

261
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,319
syringe and just drop a precisely

262
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:47,970
controlled amount at the right time okay

263
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,128
so you've got your substrate you've got

264
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,199
a layer of something on it for a mask

265
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,439
now you need to put a design on it you

266
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:59,008
can either do that using this kind of

267
00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:01,559
setup the absolute simplest you know

268
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,869
you're doing this with varied with very

269
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,850
few resources you can literally print it

270
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:08,189
out with a laser printer on transparency

271
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,929
film you can get decent resolution good

272
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:12,719
enough to make simple transistors and

273
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:15,449
stuff anyway and you just lay it on top

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,729
printed side down and expose through

275
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:21,988
that if you want to get more complicated

276
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:23,339
probably the easiest thing to do is or

277
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,350
the best thing to do is set up a

278
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,509
maskless lithography set in the setup so

279
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,759
rather than using a mask at all you get

280
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,979
rid of that completely and use a laser

281
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,089
to write directly on your substrate

282
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:38,789
right directly on the wafer so you need

283
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,099
a UV laser you've shoot that through a

284
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,269
beam expander because your optics down

285
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,849
here are going to work better with a

286
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,779
fatter beam put it through mirrors that

287
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,779
steer in X&Y

288
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,909
put it through a lens that then will map

289
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:56,459
on to sort of a two-dimensional plane

290
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,709
it's called an F theta lens they're not

291
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,998
not that readily available surplus but

292
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,248
do show up there are some inexpensive

293
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:04,649
Chinese manufacturers on Alibaba that

294
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:09,659
worked pretty well and write directly on

295
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:11,879
your wafer to drive this there's there's

296
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,979
galva so these mirrors are driven by

297
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,909
galvanometer motors that look something

298
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:18,569
like that

299
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:21,389
these are giant ancient ones these are

300
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,159
out of microscopes set up the probably

301
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,309
the best commercial equivalent right now

302
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,929
for hobbyists is to look into

303
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:30,389
inexpensive laser laser lightshow

304
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:33,809
projectors which have a similar kind of

305
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,319
XY mirror set up and have more open

306
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:39,179
interfaces and better ways to drive them

307
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:41,598
but I'm driving this now through connect

308
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:44,279
ultimately with linuxcnc

309
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,289
you draw your pattern you tell it to

310
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,609
write you you know use the spindle on

311
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:49,529
and off commands that you would use for

312
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:51,569
a CNC machine to turn the laser on and

313
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:56,159
off and you go around and you draw your

314
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:58,949
pattern directly on once you've got the

315
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,929
pattern written on your mask you then

316
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:02,488
need to etch away the silicon this is

317
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:05,598
where we start to get into some of the

318
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:08,759
more industrial processes and equipment

319
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:11,369
there's two basic ways of etching if you

320
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,739
use a chemical edged with silicon you

321
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:15,869
end up with something like this which is

322
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,609
called an isotropic etch you don't get

323
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,909
straight lines up and down because the

324
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:23,609
chemical is kind of attacking from the

325
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:25,499
sides and the silicon crystal is

326
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:27,779
oriented in such a way that you end up

327
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:30,089
with depending on the exact kind of

328
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,209
silicon usually around a 55 degree angle

329
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:36,839
slopes to your edges so you end up with

330
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:38,909
something that looks like that that

331
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,529
works for some parts it tends to work

332
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:42,269
well like for micro fluidics where you

333
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,389
want to run a liquid through the

334
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,759
channels but for the parts I want to

335
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,639
make I want square edges so I need an

336
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,409
isotropic edge which means that wet

337
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,849
etching isn't gonna work very well for

338
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:56,009
what I want to do but it's the easier

339
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:57,760
easier set up it works well for some

340
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,529
things we'll talk a little bit about it

341
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,839
so to do a wet etch you take your

342
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:06,490
silicon wafer with the mask on it and

343
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:10,089
you drop it into a chemical like Koh

344
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:14,649
potassium hydroxide it's a strong base

345
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:17,529
you probably see it in things like Drano

346
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,329
and it will selectively etch away the

347
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,570
silicon while not eating away the mask

348
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,380
as quickly if you want to make like if

349
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,000
you're trying to cut out

350
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,620
three-dimensional pieces you're probably

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,269
not going to be able to etch all the way

352
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,459
through your wafer to cut a piece free

353
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:33,880
but again for etching channels if we're

354
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,540
making micro electronics it works really

355
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,149
well and you can do it just with a

356
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,339
container of Koh on a hot plate you

357
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:45,130
leave it in there you tend you get like

358
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,990
maybe a micrometer per minute so it's

359
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,320
not a fast process but again if you're

360
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:55,180
only trying to edge 50 or 100

361
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,639
micrometers it's not that bad to do

362
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,739
anisotropic to get straight edges to

363
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,199
your parts it gets more complicated and

364
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,920
the process that I've really dug into is

365
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,719
plasma etching one of the original

366
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,719
versions of this is called deep reactive

367
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:17,199
ion etching was patented by Bosch more

368
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,300
than 21 years ago and involves putting

369
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,930
you're putting your wafer and putting

370
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,300
your wafer into a plasma chamber with

371
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,729
the right composition of gases that you

372
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,859
get ions that will attack the silicon

373
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,649
and accelerating the those accelerating

374
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,899
those ions down toward your substrate so

375
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,850
that they hit both the mask and the

376
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,930
unmasked parts but selectively etch away

377
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,269
the silicon that hasn't been masked to

378
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,930
get or to get really nice square edges

379
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:49,269
to your parts the ions that you're

380
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,500
bombarding this thing with are not going

381
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,639
to be coming down in a perfectly

382
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,459
straight line some of them are going to

383
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,510
be bouncing around to the sides and so

384
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,099
they're going to hit the sides of your

385
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,269
channels as well as the bottom they're

386
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,250
mostly going to hit the bottom but some

387
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,010
of them are going to hit the sides and

388
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,990
so you alternate you do a round of

389
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,790
bombarding with with chemicals that are

390
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,260
going to etch the silicon and then you

391
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,500
actually bombard it with a little bit

392
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,920
more mask you apply a very thin

393
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,270
not very strong layer of a mask to the

394
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,500
entire thing and that's going to coat

395
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,939
the sides of the channels it gets the

396
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,610
bottom that goes over the top it kind of

397
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,560
goes everywhere but that gets eaten away

398
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,000
on the bottom of your channel very

399
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,920
quickly when you start to etch again

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,200
it's it's not very strong but it's

401
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,920
strong enough to mostly resist the few

402
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,890
ions that are hitting the sides and so

403
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,199
by alternating masking bombarding

404
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,360
masking bombarding you you eat away at

405
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,650
the bottom of their channels but keep

406
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,760
the sides protected to do this you need

407
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,980
a a chamber a plasma chamber I'm using

408
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,500
an RF inductively coupled plasma and

409
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,570
we'll get into that in a moment

410
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,000
you need an RF source so this is going

411
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,520
to be a few hundred watts to a kilowatt

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,860
of most usually thirteen point five six

413
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:07,180
megahertz the is M band so you're not

414
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,680
interfering with local TV too much that

415
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,670
gets sent into your chamber through a

416
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,050
matching network like an antenna tuner

417
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,590
there's a smaller RF source that

418
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,690
connects to the chuck so that the ions

419
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:21,750
that you're creating want to go and hit

420
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,460
your Chuck which holds your wafer you

421
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,960
need a whole vacuum system because all

422
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,329
of this has to be done under a pretty

423
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,580
good vacuum and then you need to

424
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,620
introduce the right gases in the right

425
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,110
proportions at the right time into your

426
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,929
chamber so you do that using mass flow

427
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,699
controllers I've got a slide later about

428
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,440
mass flow controllers but if you've ever

429
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,600
tried to build a system where you're

430
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,390
precisely controlling a flow of gas for

431
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,949
anything they're awesome they're really

432
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,990
nice somebody has just taken the whole

433
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,430
system put it into a nice little box and

434
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,900
you just buy it and plug it in and use

435
00:17:51,430 --> 00:18:00,310
it okay so my inspiration for this part

436
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,410
was MIT is one inch fab project that's a

437
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:05,710
project that's trying to build a whole

438
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,420
semiconductor processing line using

439
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,100
one-inch substrate most commercial

440
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,440
systems are now onto eight inch or

441
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,600
bigger they're trying to build a whole

442
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,000
system for under a million dollars and

443
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,129
as one piece that includes a deep

444
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,460
reactive ion etching which is covered by

445
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:25,640
this 2014 master's thesis by gold and

446
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,730
and I owe a great debt to them for

447
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,159
documenting the whole thing really well

448
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:35,960
it's been great to read through steel

449
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,429
pieces from and try to reuse I share the

450
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,669
goal of trying to build a whole system

451
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:46,279
for less than a million dollars but I'm

452
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,690
really trying to keep it down I'm not

453
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,490
sure if my partner's in the room anyway

454
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,919
I'm trying to keep it down under the

455
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:58,730
cost of say a decent gaming PC

456
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:02,210
unfortunately the cost of GPU cards

457
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,220
keeps increasing quickly enough with

458
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:07,820
that as the metric it's it's it's easier

459
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,010
to keep okay so the plasma etching set

460
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,149
up and on the right is my basement so

461
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,220
this is the setup down there now on the

462
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,039
left here we've got a plasma etching

463
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,480
setup so here we've got the chamber

464
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,120
where you're making the plasma so this

465
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,570
is coupled to your your larger RF source

466
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,428
there's a coil that goes around there

467
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,439
it's inductively coupled and so it

468
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,210
creates a plasma out of these gases that

469
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,250
you're letting in through the top the

470
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,440
ions all shoot down they're attracted to

471
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,539
the chuck they hit your chuck whatever

472
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,090
chemical reaction happens and the

473
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:43,639
products all whatever gases you're

474
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:49,010
creating go out through your vacuum

475
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:51,428
system okay so you need to create a

476
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,429
vacuum

477
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,600
there's a bunch of ways to do this this

478
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,570
is sort of the easiest that I found thus

479
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:05,149
far is to use a turbo molecular bat

480
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,510
vacuum pump I've got a slide that shows

481
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,850
that a little better in a little bit but

482
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,580
you need a high vacuum pump this will

483
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,260
get you down to pressures of you know

484
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,909
ten to the minus six ten to the minus

485
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,010
seventh Torr somewhere between the

486
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,200
vacuum if you open the door in the space

487
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,920
station and the vacuum on the surface of

488
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,810
the moon probably better than the

489
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,430
surface of Mars I want to build a Mars

490
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,629
box by the way maybe that's the next

491
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:38,600
time so it gets you really a pretty good

492
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,580
vacuum it's down the far enough that you

493
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,709
have to start worrying about I mean the

494
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,169
main source of pressure inside this

495
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,820
thing is water vapor that's come it's

496
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,250
gotten bound up in the surf and the

497
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,129
stainless steel surface of the interior

498
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,670
of all your parts and that sort of

499
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,650
slowly creeps back out and that's the

500
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,830
that's most of what's inside this when

501
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,540
it's running there's a conductance valve

502
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,699
here because we don't actually want the

503
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,860
chamber to be at that low of a vacuum we

504
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,770
want maybe 10 to the minus 3rd Torr

505
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,360
it's a few Milot or so there's a

506
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,430
conductance valve here which is just a

507
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,379
and in this case it's just a big flapper

508
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,090
and when it's horizontal

509
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,400
it stops molecules from bouncing out

510
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,750
when it's vertical they pass through

511
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,580
more easily and so the pressure in the

512
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,070
chamber drops and then there's a gate

513
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,159
here because the gate valve is just like

514
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,040
an on or off can allows allow gas to go

515
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,200
through or don't and that's used to

516
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,730
separate off the plasma chamber from the

517
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,980
rest of the system so they can leave

518
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,750
this pumped down or purged with dry

519
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,210
nitrogen to keep water vapor from

520
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:46,400
getting in because it's humid because

521
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:48,590
it's my basement the high vacuum pump

522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,650
will only work if it's already in a

523
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,270
vacuum it has some veins that's been

524
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,120
really really quickly we'll get to that

525
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,440
I've got some pictures so it already

526
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,469
needs to be in a vacuum so you need a

527
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,450
backing pump and this is if you think of

528
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,760
a vacuum pump you might think of like a

529
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,900
box about that big that makes a whirring

530
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,430
noise and it looks

531
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,050
a lot like an air compressor works a lot

532
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,030
like an air compressor and that's pretty

533
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,500
much what's down here there are

534
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,760
different kinds they're different styles

535
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,650
you can fill them with different kinds

536
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,420
of oil and that matters based on what

537
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:23,420
you're trying to do with your chamber I

538
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:26,180
won't get into that ok so here's here's

539
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:30,230
sort of another view with a few more

540
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,630
parts so here's the turbo pump there's

541
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,580
the four line trap because the backing

542
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,080
pump will release a little bit of oil

543
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,129
and so you want to trap that before it

544
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,980
gets into the rest of your system

545
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,980
there's a couple of pressure gauges you

546
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,330
start working with vacuum you quickly

547
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,040
realize there are a ton of different

548
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,659
kinds of pressure gauges they tend to

549
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,940
work at four different pressure ranges

550
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,290
bad things happen if you turn some of

551
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,840
them on when they aren't at a good

552
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:56,180
enough vacuum and so you end up having a

553
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,399
bunch of them hung off the system I also

554
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,110
just mention that like half of the stuff

555
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,940
in this stack is there you know these

556
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,100
little funnel shaped pieces of this

557
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,410
chunk like half of that stuff is just

558
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,820
there because I'm buying pieces as

559
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,470
cheaply as I can find them from

560
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,330
different sources and then hefting to

561
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,270
bodge together adaptors to like plug

562
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,590
everything together so this is the

563
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,800
source of the comment about your box of

564
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,679
plumbing parts a surprising amount of

565
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,110
this and frankly most other science I've

566
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:32,060
been involved when sort of devolves down

567
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,370
to plumbing so the gauge up here above

568
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,860
the gate valve is good for measuring

569
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,139
high pressure higher pressures so down

570
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,639
to you know 10 to the third 10 to the

571
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,390
minus third 10 to the minus fourth tour

572
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,070
the cold-cathode gauge down here is the

573
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,290
cheapest gauge I could find that goes

574
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,669
down much lower so that I can tell how

575
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:54,409
well the the turbo pump is actually

576
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:58,460
working okay there's my thumb picture so

577
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:02,960
the pump is in here looking from the

578
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,460
side it's in here it has its if you

579
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,970
picture a jet engine that's pretty much

580
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,310
it it's electrically driven has a bunch

581
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,900
of rotors that look like what you can

582
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,250
see there this is a particularly dirty

583
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,680
turbo pump I don't know if you can see

584
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,570
that in the picture but one of the

585
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,450
challenges with buying surplus is always

586
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,040
trying to figure out

587
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,510
what this stuff was used for in the past

588
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,940
and how to clean it I think in my last

589
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,590
slide I mentioned it's really good to

590
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,200
have a plan for how you're going to

591
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,909
clean and dispose of things that you're

592
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,500
working on it because you if you're

593
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,810
buying industrial surplus you never

594
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,860
quite know what it's been used for so

595
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,409
you kind of want to take it out of the

596
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:45,090
box with gloves on and you know just

597
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:47,340
assume it's bad so your turbopump you've

598
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,110
got a bunch of rotating vanes in between

599
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,870
the in-between those rotating vanes are

600
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,810
fixed blades and it works kind of like a

601
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,699
ping-pong machine so gas molecules this

602
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,250
is looking down the face of it gas

603
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,050
molecules come to come meandering down

604
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,550
there just through Brownian motion or

605
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,639
like bouncing around in classic

606
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,860
Newtonian physics and stumbled their way

607
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,700
into these rotating blades and just get

608
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,320
bounced out and just by virtue of the

609
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
molecules bouncing around inside this

610
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,169
chamber and eventually making their way

611
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,270
down to the pump where they get batted

612
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,860
down further

613
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,530
eventually they mostly go out of the

614
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,709
chamber it spins that I think about

615
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:28,170
90,000 rpm mine are old so they're not

616
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,880
quite there but the noise that the sound

617
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,170
that it makes as it spins up is amazing

618
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,420
and it's kind of my favorite part of the

619
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:37,350
whole thing you're active if you

620
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:41,130
remember the the old you know the good

621
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,240
Batman the the seatbelts fastened

622
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:48,210
turbines to speed

623
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,760
that's kind of the theme here anyway so

624
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,690
it's driven they're driven by

625
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,590
electrically you've got a motor

626
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,140
controller here

627
00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:00,090
it's basically a three or more phase

628
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:02,070
motor so it starts out at a low

629
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,050
frequency ramps up and runs the whole

630
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,310
thing up to speed the electronics aren't

631
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,409
that complicated there's some pretty

632
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,590
good plans online like for older edwards

633
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,630
pumps for doing DIY controllers and

634
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,250
that's probably the least expensive way

635
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,880
of getting into a turbo pump the way

636
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:22,050
that i did it was to find some cheap old

637
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,290
ones buy a few of them and in as is

638
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,639
condition and just try out in mix and

639
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,280
and try to clean them up and get them

640
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,370
working it's not the fastest way to

641
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,710
things you're probably better off

642
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,290
finding one that they say works that has

643
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:41,450
documentation that has a DIY controller

644
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:43,100
and building the controller yourself if

645
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,110
you want to know what's happening in the

646
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,719
chamber then there's something called a

647
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:51,709
residual gas analyzer now this is a

648
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,160
small quadrupole mass spectrometer that

649
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:57,710
sits in the bottom of the chamber

650
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:02,510
connects to some software that I got on

651
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:05,950
three floppy disks it the documentation

652
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,150
says that it works well under Windows NT

653
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,360
but that they really recommend Windows

654
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:15,200
3.1 I've had pretty good luck with

655
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,479
Windows 98 with it but I'm not I have a

656
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,580
network to that computer it's just it's

657
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,170
a standalone but when you run it you get

658
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,860
a little I don't know if you can see the

659
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,660
little graph but here's the atomic mass

660
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,790
starting from zero I think running up to

661
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,620
about 200 and it tells you how much it's

662
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,639
measuring it at each of those masses and

663
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,139
then there's some software that will

664
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,630
analyze that and tell you yeah you've

665
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,900
got water vapor in your system and how

666
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,030
much the partial pressure of that is and

667
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,280
so this is this is really useful for

668
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,860
telling what's going on in your system

669
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,420
how badly are things contaminated is is

670
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,760
the whole thing full of pump that's

671
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,620
that's backed out of your backing pump

672
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,570
I'm sorry full of oil that's backed out

673
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:59,270
of your backing pump or is it you know

674
00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:01,100
reasonably clean for control this is

675
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,720
gonna this may sound like a joke but I

676
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,149
mean it very seriously I took a lot of

677
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,670
inspiration from model railway control

678
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:10,610
systems if you've ever seen one of these

679
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:12,620
huge layouts they often have little

680
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,479
control panels with with lots of

681
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,479
switches nice little lot of nice little

682
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,730
pieces of tape like laying out what's

683
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,920
happening and you know which switch is

684
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,900
moving like which pieces of thing and so

685
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,030
I like to think this is my own small

686
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,030
tribute to like the long history of

687
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:32,360
model railway connecting to hacking but

688
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,280
anyway we've got a basic switch panel

689
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,580
here to turn things on and off

690
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:41,760
at this point I mostly rely on myself to

691
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,760
not turn the wrong thing on at the wrong

692
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,530
time which isn't the safest way of doing

693
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,680
things but is quick and easy for

694
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,080
prototyping things like there's the high

695
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,490
voltage for the cold cathode gage if you

696
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,929
turn that on when the system is at

697
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,440
atmospheric pressure you'll burn out the

698
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:00,420
gage it's dead if you open the gate

699
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,860
valve and vent the system suddenly to

700
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,910
atmosphere you know there will be a loud

701
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,770
bang so you don't want to do that so

702
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:11,850
that that's that control panel these are

703
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,889
the another pressure gage the controller

704
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,480
for that conductance valve so this

705
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,310
connects to one of the pressure gages it

706
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,200
has a bunch of settings and it's got a

707
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,669
little PID loop controller to control

708
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,520
the position of that flapper valve to

709
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,410
keep the right pressure in the chamber

710
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,050
the residual gas analyzer and then the

711
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,400
old Pentium I think it's a Pentium to

712
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:37,020
actually a computer that's running

713
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:40,080
Windows 98 my day job is working and

714
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:44,129
medical stuff so um you still I'm have

715
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,679
ting to keep old computers running for

716
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,950
the Chuck RF source is really happy to

717
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:53,010
be able to grab a relatively new open

718
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,510
design for an RF amplifier so this comes

719
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,670
out of the taper group they built this

720
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,129
as part of their open software to find

721
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,970
radio project and it's a broadband 20

722
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,070
watt amp

723
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,170
I only need like 10 or 15 watts so it's

724
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,909
kind of perfect it's available as a kit

725
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,430
it's the first thing I built that was a

726
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,470
kit entirely built out of surface mount

727
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,540
components it's easy to build it's fun

728
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,850
if you need a 20 watt amp I highly

729
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,300
recommend it and so there it is running

730
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:22,939
with a little test

731
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,940
source at 13 point five six megahertz

732
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,720
for the main source you need something

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,330
bigger and so this is a surplice one

734
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,760
kilowatt RF source the industries for

735
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,260
plasma etching sort of standardized on

736
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,890
thirteen point five six as part of the

737
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:46,140
is M band probably mostly late 80s early

738
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,960
90s if you're looking around you'll find

739
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,640
a lot of kilohertz kind of sources I

740
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,860
think one hundred hundred and fifty

741
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,600
kilohertz kind of range that were used

742
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,000
before that and they're still used for

743
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,500
some things but the thirteen point five

744
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,539
six megahertz are a little easier to

745
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,919
work with a little easier to find this

746
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,929
thing is still water-cooled

747
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,360
so you have to have a water pump a pump

748
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,130
and stuff another recurring theme is

749
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,629
that there's a lot of infrastructure

750
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,750
around getting this running you know

751
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,549
just to get the valves working you need

752
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,190
an air compressor you need regulators

753
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,299
you need solenoid valves to turn on and

754
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,690
off the right air lines at the right

755
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,149
time

756
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,220
similarly to get the RF source to turn

757
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:25,199
on there has to be water running through

758
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,080
it and it has a flow sensor and will

759
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,730
shut off if there's not sufficient water

760
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,379
it also has an interlock where if it's

761
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,600
not connected to a control system it

762
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,600
won't turn on and this is good to know

763
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,178
when you go shopping because you'll find

764
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,820
a lot of folks who list these on ebay on

765
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,740
other sites and say well I turn it on

766
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,158
the power light comes on but nothing

767
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,710
works

768
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,350
and this is often because it has safety

769
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:53,760
interlocks and so and this particular

770
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,439
one there's a 25 pin db25 for it on the

771
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,940
back it expects a couple of those pins

772
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,220
to be shorted together and it's a safety

773
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,429
thing if you connect that to your chain

774
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,950
of interlocks if it's open then the RF

775
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:06,600
source knows to shut down and so a lot

776
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,140
of these end up getting listed and sold

777
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,270
for not much money as as is condition or

778
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,010
not working when actually it is working

779
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,929
fine that's just the interlock so hot

780
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,750
tip if you're if you're shopping for

781
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:25,110
surplus RF sources look for ones that

782
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:28,880
turn on but nothing happens the these

783
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:31,918
are intended to work into a 50 ohm load

784
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,860
just like you know ham radio or other

785
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,540
kinds of radio sources are intended to

786
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,760
work into a 50 ohm load

787
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,820
the art the chamber that we're coupling

788
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,879
this to is almost certainly not a 50 ohm

789
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,668
load and anyway and so we need something

790
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,230
to match those the easiest way to do

791
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:51,570
that that I found is to use an antenna

792
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,570
tuner like I this is a Heathkit ham

793
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:57,540
antenna tuner and you sit there and you

794
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:59,370
turn the knobs and it's for those of you

795
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,960
who are into such things it's a PI

796
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,270
Network you've got a couple of

797
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,150
capacitors you've got an inductor in the

798
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,010
middle and by varying these you can

799
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,380
adjust the characteristics to match both

800
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,720
the you know resistance and reactance of

801
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,370
the chamber to the RF source get a

802
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,080
smooth transfer of power and avoid

803
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,489
having your RF source going to shut down

804
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,730
because it's getting too much power

805
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:25,470
reflected back you can either do that

806
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:29,010
manually or what I'm building is a servo

807
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:31,980
drive to do that because when you're

808
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,750
doing the the Bosch process deep

809
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,669
reactive ion etching remember you're

810
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,679
bombarding with ions that are yet young

811
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:39,480
away the silicon and then you're putting

812
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,040
that mask layer back on and you're

813
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,520
switching that maybe every couple of

814
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,230
seconds so you're not going to be able

815
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,639
to do that by turning the knobs by hand

816
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,700
but you can do it by turning the knobs

817
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,520
with motors so this was my first effort

818
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,860
so these are a couple of air variable

819
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,299
capacitors there's six pieces and then

820
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,530
there's there's parts that move and

821
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,840
depending on how you move it the

822
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,549
capacitance changes these are some

823
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,549
motors that are attached to it with

824
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:08,639
little you know drive sprockets this is

825
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:12,149
mostly out of an old commercial product

826
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:16,409
that I bought and when I bought it I got

827
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:18,239
one that was too new it ends up being

828
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,369
very tightly packed together very

829
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,080
optimized I'm sure very efficient and a

830
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:24,240
nice small form-factor from when it was

831
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,149
eventually installed but by going back

832
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,979
another 10 years I got one that is much

833
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,230
more open more and more designed to be

834
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,290
worked on and so the case all comes

835
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:37,469
nicely apart you've got some pancake

836
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,290
gear motors they're coupled with nice

837
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,658
big vacuum capacitors and by turning

838
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,550
those you you vary the capacitance

839
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,889
there's also not shown in this roller

840
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,770
inductor which is a long coil of metal

841
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,780
with a little

842
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,929
that follows along it you spin that with

843
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,210
a motor and by varying these you can

844
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:57,910
again adjust the capacitance adjust the

845
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,560
inductance and by measuring the amount

846
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,879
of power that's going forward in your

847
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,009
system the amount that's being reflected

848
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,750
back to the transmitter you can tune

849
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,030
things so that you get an efficient

850
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,640
transfer of power between the RF source

851
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,860
and the chamber I'm driving all this

852
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,020
with one of these Adafruit motor

853
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,880
controllers which are a great little

854
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,810
project product for controlling motors

855
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,119
from arduino z' work really well and

856
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:28,869
handle the power that i need without any

857
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:31,119
problems let's see another process i

858
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,560
want to talk about there's a couple more

859
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,960
processes i want to talk about a little

860
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,210
bit and i'll get into some of the other

861
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,490
links other other kinds of things that

862
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:45,760
you can do one is sputtering so

863
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,350
sputtering is taking your source yours

864
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,140
your sputtering target as it's called

865
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:54,850
which is the metal that you're going to

866
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:56,920
be using to coat your substrate putting

867
00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:01,600
it into a plasma and getting some of the

868
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:05,080
the atoms of your target to ionize and

869
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,779
get shot on to your substrate so it's

870
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,390
often used and and the sputter coder

871
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,060
that i have is is meant for coating

872
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,589
targets for electron microscopy so if

873
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,090
you have an electron microscope and you

874
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,790
want to look at something it has to be

875
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,450
conductive so if you want to look at an

876
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:24,460
ant you need to make that ant conductive

877
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,868
so this is from wikipedia it's it's a

878
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,580
picture of an ant that's been gold

879
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:33,640
coated and you often use gold or gold

880
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,049
platinum silver in some cases titanium

881
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,879
you know all these metals can be

882
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,730
sputtered onto targets and that's

883
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,060
commonly done for electron microscopy

884
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,010
it's also done for things like if you

885
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,290
want to put a thin metal coat onto a

886
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,530
plastic disk to make her a cd-rom you

887
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:52,960
could sputter it on if you want to gold

888
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,640
coat or platinum coat a five and a

889
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,560
quarter floppy to give out to the game

890
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,890
of the year you

891
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,710
you could sputter it on sputter coder

892
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,629
has a vacuum chamber here there's that

893
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,130
blue cable that blue hose you may or may

894
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,220
not be able to see goes to the same

895
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,080
vacuum system so you've got a vacuum

896
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,339
chamber here your thing that you want a

897
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,470
sputter goes on the little table there

898
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,910
your your target the metal that you're

899
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,480
going to sputter goes in the top here

900
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:21,250
there's a DC magnetron that energizes

901
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,720
the whole system you let a little bit of

902
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,600
argon and to make the right kind of

903
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,089
plasma and over the course of a few

904
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,819
seconds it'll it'll shoot enough metal

905
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:34,210
onto your target to put a few atom thick

906
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:41,110
layer onto it so this is useful not only

907
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:47,530
for gold coating ads but also for if you

908
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:49,390
want to put that metal layer onto your

909
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,280
semiconductors so you you if you're

910
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:55,930
making semiconductors you typically will

911
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,880
will want to put a put it you'll build

912
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,560
up multiple layers some of which will be

913
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,660
metal and the best way of putting that

914
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,340
on is sputtering I'm mostly interested

915
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,609
in using it for the parts I want to make

916
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,680
for a couple of things one is for

917
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:11,290
titanium night writing some parts which

918
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,240
gives a very hard surface to them that's

919
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,250
done often with cutting tools if you go

920
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,870
and you buy titanium drill bits from

921
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,810
Home Depot they're probably titanium

922
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:22,120
nitride coated so you get a very hard

923
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,620
surface on two parts and using a sputter

924
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,299
coder you can do that not only on two

925
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:29,830
metals but on two pretty much any kind

926
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,690
of part also for some kind of aesthetic

927
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,720
effects because ultimately I want to

928
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,370
make watches and watch parts and it's

929
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,319
surprisingly important in that world

930
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:42,009
that it looks cool so you know we'll

931
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,200
make some cool-looking parts once you've

932
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,890
once you've actually made your earpiece

933
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,319
you typically don't make you know one

934
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,210
transistor on a wafer you'll make an

935
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,520
array of them usually laid out in a grid

936
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,950
and you've got to get them back apart so

937
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,280
you've got this silicon wafer

938
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:02,169
that's zero point two millimeters thick

939
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,230
something like that and you no need to

940
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,850
very precisely cut it into pieces and so

941
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,300
this is a dicing saw

942
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:12,460
as I as with with most of my equipment

943
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,910
it's from you know probably late 70s

944
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,400
early 80s and is meant to hold up to

945
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,670
about a two to three inch wafer wafer

946
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,070
goes on this little vacuum check here

947
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,240
there's a blade I'm guessing because I

948
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,680
can't really see the screen very well

949
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,080
but there's there's a horizontal saw

950
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,049
blade there which is a very thin diamond

951
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,940
coated disc an air spindle that spins it

952
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,560
up really fast a microscope so you can

953
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,060
see where you're lining up with and it's

954
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,040
got some stepper motors that just moves

955
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,210
the table back and forth and so you go

956
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,779
through and you program at with these

957
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:45,970
flip switches to you know do a cut move

958
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,590
over half a centimeter do another cut

959
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,980
and it'll go through and happily you

960
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:53,740
know do do that cutting for you so this

961
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,420
allows you not only to cut your pieces

962
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,520
apart when you're done but also I'm

963
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,890
working with very small wafers you know

964
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,300
this is one inch fab idea it's kind of

965
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,670
the scale I'm thinking as well where

966
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:08,260
most of my stuff is one inch maybe up to

967
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,880
two inch when I'm buying surplus wafers

968
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,320
they're often in other sizes and so

969
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,360
being able to cut out squares or

970
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:18,040
whatever shape from those is pretty

971
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:21,370
important that's kind of the last piece

972
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:24,759
of infrastructure needed around it if I

973
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:26,560
wanted to actually build electronics you

974
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,840
also need a die Bhandar which is where

975
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,700
you take this tiny little fragment of

976
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,410
silicon with your with your thing on top

977
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,859
of it that you've cut out and you then

978
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,420
stick that to usually a metal substrate

979
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:41,530
if you think of a transistor that's like

980
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:44,860
the the older metal cylinder transistors

981
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,960
the bottom of that is got that piece of

982
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,330
silicon stuck to it and then the rest of

983
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,820
it is just a protective cover and epoxy

984
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,140
encapsulated chips the the tiny fragment

985
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,730
of silicon is somewhere in there and

986
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,259
then you've got to attach wires to it

987
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,480
for the electrical signals to go in and

988
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,080
out and so the wire attachment is done

989
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,310
using a wire bonder where it's a kind of

990
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,660
similar looking thing you've got a

991
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,040
microscope to look through at least the

992
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,420
manual ones you've got a microscope to

993
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,310
look through you've got a little table

994
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,870
you move around and you've got a button

995
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,538
to press where this finger comes down

996
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,279
and bonds a wire to that spot and

997
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:20,719
so you you go and you go around your

998
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:22,489
chip you find the pieces that you want

999
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,519
to connect to and you go for I want a

1000
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:27,380
wire from here to here and it's a kind

1001
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,669
of slow tedious process to do by hand

1002
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,049
but if you're just making a handful of

1003
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:32,049
transistors it's not that bad

1004
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:40,669
generally speaking I found it to be

1005
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,959
pretty essential and really important to

1006
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:45,408
be able to make some of these parts

1007
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:47,328
yourself I mean I mentioned that the

1008
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:49,069
column is about twice as high as the

1009
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,349
actual components because of the various

1010
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:54,049
adapters and bits and pieces I've had to

1011
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:58,339
stick in it's been a pretty key to be

1012
00:41:54,049 --> 00:42:00,919
able to make some of those myself this

1013
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:04,130
is where if you don't want to turn your

1014
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:06,078
basement into both a Fab Lab and also a

1015
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,999
machine shop this is where getting

1016
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,979
involved in your local like makerspace

1017
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:13,009
or place that has a lathe and a mill and

1018
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:16,759
will let you use them is really kind of

1019
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:18,619
essential a couple of parts this one is

1020
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:22,630
is the bottom of a safety thing that

1021
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:26,779
I'll talk about in a second this is a

1022
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:28,639
whole ring encased in a little inner and

1023
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:30,919
outer ring to hold the old ring in place

1024
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,889
and these are used really commonly for

1025
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:35,149
one of the styles of vacuum fittings

1026
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:37,309
they come in different diameters is a

1027
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:38,509
few standardized diameters and what you

1028
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,739
do is you put one of those between your

1029
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:41,809
parts you clamp them together with

1030
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:43,309
enough force to compress the o-ring when

1031
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,019
you pump your system down it gets all

1032
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:48,739
lit it gets further clamped because of

1033
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:50,269
the vacuum and that's enough to hold

1034
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:53,509
everything together and keep it air

1035
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:55,069
tight these are really nice to work with

1036
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:57,499
because all you have to machine is a

1037
00:42:55,069 --> 00:43:00,109
groove big enough for the metal inner

1038
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:02,448
ring to sit in and then a flat surface

1039
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:04,339
for the o-ring to sit on and so it ends

1040
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:08,109
up being a really easy way to build

1041
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:08,109
pieces and connect them together I

1042
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:14,269
mentioned mass flow controllers I'm

1043
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:15,589
gonna mention them again because I

1044
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:17,928
really wish somebody had told me about

1045
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:19,519
them like 20 years ago before I spent a

1046
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,789
lot of time like building closed-loop

1047
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,868
systems for gas control mass flow

1048
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:29,389
controller is a all-in-one system you

1049
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:30,940
know gas comes and gas goes out you give

1050
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:33,640
it to zero to five volts

1051
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,339
and the zero to 5 volts controls how

1052
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:40,210
much comes in from zero up to the full

1053
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:42,069
range you know 1 liter per minute

1054
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,430
whatever whatever the range of your mass

1055
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:47,380
flow controller isn't this is a really

1056
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,720
simple set up that I put together that

1057
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,779
just has a potentiometer to control that

1058
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,910
control voltage and switch to turn the

1059
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:56,680
gas on and off and you just turn the

1060
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,410
knob and based on where the knob is you

1061
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,029
get an output of course you can connect

1062
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,319
them to your Raspberry Pi Zord we knows

1063
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:04,240
beaglebones whatever your favorite

1064
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,940
microcontroller with an analog output is

1065
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,258
and drive them from that there are

1066
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,809
different kinds of them that operate at

1067
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:12,700
different speeds and they tend to be

1068
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:14,710
calibrated with different gases you'll

1069
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:18,430
see mass flow controllers for a nitrogen

1070
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:21,430
for CF 4 for hydrogen they will

1071
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:23,038
typically you know modulo the C at what

1072
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,180
the seals are made out of and how

1073
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,349
corrosive your gases they'll usually

1074
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,220
work with anything and there's

1075
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:33,309
calibration adjustments you can do I

1076
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,558
want to almost end by just mentioning a

1077
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:39,460
little bit about safety is this is the

1078
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,230
dad part of the talk I apologize if

1079
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,730
you're working with with flammables get

1080
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,630
a flammables cabinet keep your fire

1081
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:49,359
exits clear use a firm foot fume hood

1082
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:52,839
goggles gloves all that if you check out

1083
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,240
your local nano or Micro fabrication

1084
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,529
resources there are a lot of these labs

1085
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,109
all around the country usually

1086
00:44:56,529 --> 00:45:00,519
affiliated with different universities

1087
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:02,259
they pretty much all put all of their

1088
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,660
standard operating procedures online and

1089
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:06,250
that'll tell you like hey this chemical

1090
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,960
is super dangerous make sure to only use

1091
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,299
it in the fume hood that's rated for it

1092
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,480
and they tend to be written in non

1093
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:15,160
hysterical language and to tell you

1094
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,779
actually reasonable precautions that you

1095
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,649
probably do really want to take when

1096
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:19,269
you're working with this stuff

1097
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,220
especially if you're doing it in your

1098
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:22,959
garage or your basement and have family

1099
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,009
members and other humans around where

1100
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,869
you're working also as you're thinking

1101
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:31,299
about processes I've tried to be really

1102
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,950
careful to pick processes where all of

1103
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:34,990
the gases that I'm using are non-toxic

1104
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,848
all the chemicals I'm using are

1105
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,799
relatively non-toxic you know I'm using

1106
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:40,599
potassium hydroxide I'm not using

1107
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,549
hydrofluoric acid which you use for a

1108
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,369
lot of etching processes because I'm not

1109
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,710
comfortable having

1110
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:46,970
in the house you know other people make

1111
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,289
other decisions and we'll talk about

1112
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:53,450
some of those uh people on the next

1113
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:56,210
slide have clean up materials ready and

1114
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,460
think about storage and disposal if you

1115
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,660
call up your local hazardous waste

1116
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,849
people and you

1117
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,920
I'm not saying to use a burner phone but

1118
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:05,299
maybe don't tell them your address and

1119
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,369
talk to them they can be surprisingly

1120
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:09,259
helpful it's saying well yeah you've got

1121
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,849
you know a few milliliters of this stuff

1122
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:14,779
just dilute it and put it down the drain

1123
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:16,670
because it's basically drain up or they

1124
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:18,319
may freak out and if they freak out you

1125
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:22,130
know pay attention to that because they

1126
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:25,490
may have good reasons so a few other few

1127
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:28,130
other resources first couple have great

1128
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:30,258
YouTube channels jeri ellsworth has a

1129
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,069
bunch of videos about making transistors

1130
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:36,619
at home specifically and using really

1131
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:38,359
low-tech ways of doing this it does use

1132
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:40,369
hydrofluoric acid for the etching and

1133
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:42,109
she's got some videos about working

1134
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,700
safely with that building your own fume

1135
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:47,749
hood and trying to do that in the most

1136
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,249
reasonable way that you can hydrofluoric

1137
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:51,618
acid is absorbed through the skin

1138
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:54,709
interacts very strongly with calcium and

1139
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:56,420
like a skin exposure equivalent to

1140
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,829
covering your hand is enough to kill you

1141
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,039
and there's really nothing you can do

1142
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:03,380
about it so you want to be careful with

1143
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,619
it work with lower concentrations and

1144
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:09,650
just know what you're getting into for

1145
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:11,299
more complicated semiconductors Sam's

1146
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,460
Iliff is doing really interesting work

1147
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:15,499
around and working toward a full thin

1148
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,499
film deposition I think he's trying to

1149
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:20,569
build like an Intel 400 for 800 8 at

1150
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:23,299
home so it's it's really cool stuff he's

1151
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:25,069
got some good videos for MEMS there are

1152
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,890
a bunch of these university programs

1153
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:29,480
that have good training videos one that

1154
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,910
I like is called support system for

1155
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,759
Microsystems education and then for

1156
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:37,640
vacuum lasers DIY repair general

1157
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:39,680
snarkiness about home electronics Sam

1158
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:44,618
gold the sir repair fact org has been

1159
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,618
like my go-to for you know 20 years plus

1160
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:51,890
ok so at this point I'd like to take any

1161
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,180
questions comments

1162
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,299
thank you very much

1163
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,299
[Music]

1164
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:08,868
[Applause]

1165
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,440
hi do you know the name is stock meant

1166
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:12,770
off

1167
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,010
no but I do know if he were giving a

1168
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:19,190
talk here today his bio would be almost

1169
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:25,910
the same as yours okay but he died about

1170
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:28,220
40 years ago okay yes but I have a

1171
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:32,440
little like a chapter that I sometimes

1172
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:36,500
read it open mic so as a short story but

1173
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,570
he invented medical devices hospitalists

1174
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:43,000
would go to him and ask to say we need

1175
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:46,820
this and he would invent them I I

1176
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,530
actually didn't meet him but I went to a

1177
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:53,780
workshop his wife was a sculptor

1178
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:57,170
actually well just to cut this short

1179
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:00,650
it seems odd to me but on YouTube you

1180
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:04,910
can find him if you look for new heaven

1181
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:06,410
new earth it's like an old hour and if

1182
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:08,799
you have a moment at the end if you can

1183
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:12,020
catch me and give me the spelling ok yes

1184
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,760
also his book is stalking the wild

1185
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:19,220
pendulum okay thanks

1186
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,660
okay other questions comments anybody

1187
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,810
want to tell me I'm an idiot or this is

1188
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:30,080
a terrible idea

1189
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:31,880
I'm sorry not really I've got some parts

1190
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,000
that I've made that I'm not happy with

1191
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,099
and they're kind of crappy and I'm sorry

1192
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,369
I don't have better pictures so it's one

1193
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:42,260
of these things where I when I propose

1194
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:45,310
the talk I thought I would be further

1195
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,310
along in six months

1196
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:52,170
so great and great ambitions not quite

1197
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:57,259
as far as I want to be hoping to come

1198
00:49:52,170 --> 00:50:00,240
back and show more but there we are

1199
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:02,940
do you have any I guess entertaining

1200
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:07,080
story give any stories about learning

1201
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,430
the stuff the hard way yeah I should I

1202
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,940
probably should have mentioned so this

1203
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:14,580
thing on the safety slide is a little

1204
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:18,089
piece that I made the tag is hanging off

1205
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:20,250
a rupture disk what that does is if your

1206
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:22,349
system gets over whatever the pressure

1207
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,570
is it ruptures these are the same things

1208
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:26,010
they use on Mythbusters all the time for

1209
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,810
testing whether you'd be killed by an

1210
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,460
explosion and they put them in a circle

1211
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,349
around it and if the air pressure across

1212
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,060
tit is greater than whatever then

1213
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:34,520
there's a hole in the disk so they're

1214
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:38,430
actually used in industry for

1215
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:40,470
pressurized systems and things I've got

1216
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,690
it on mine not because I have a

1217
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,009
pressurized system because I've got a

1218
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,930
vacuum you know it's a negative pressure

1219
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,070
but because I've got the whole system

1220
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,569
connected through the mass flow

1221
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,430
controllers and regulators and valves

1222
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,720
and whatever to compress gas tanks that

1223
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:56,029
you know are ultimately at a couple

1224
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:59,430
thousand psi and I want to avoid turning

1225
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,800
well that's on the end I want to avoid

1226
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:05,640
turning this whole thing into a rocket

1227
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:07,830
you know and and so the the entertaining

1228
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,720
story is that yeah I did once blow up my

1229
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:13,080
kitchen with a ruptured pressure vessel

1230
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,459
and so having emergency venting or you

1231
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,930
know even if you're never expecting to

1232
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,400
pressurize the things is a really good

1233
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:23,129
idea I also want to point out I think

1234
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,720
this is the only possible slideshow for

1235
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,970
this set or screensaver for this setup

1236
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,500
is the old pipes and so I was really

1237
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:37,310
happy and running Windows an idea to get

1238
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:37,310
that back okay anything else

1239
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,430
okay thank you very much
