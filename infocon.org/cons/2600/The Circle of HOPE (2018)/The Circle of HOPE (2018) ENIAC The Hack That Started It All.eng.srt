00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,650
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,509
well thank you and thank everyone for

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,590
coming out to listen to me ramble about

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,599
a very old computer the story of the

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,870
anti act to really understand it you

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,420
need to go back in time so I want you to

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,640
go back to 1943

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,930
I would suggest closing your eyes but I

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,510
can't see any of you so I can't tell if

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,529
you closed them or not

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:31,019
but if you go back to 1943 World War 2

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,800
is raging it's been about 18 months

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,440
since the bombing at Pearl Harbor the

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,110
United States has entered the war u.s.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,410
industrial production has converted over

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,360
to war production we're producing lots

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,769
and lots of planes tanks ships guns and

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,530
the guns are kind of interesting for us

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,079
because every time somebody comes up

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,629
with a new innovation for the barrel of

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,270
the gun the projectile the propellant

22
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,879
used it changes the way in which that

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,780
projectile flies and so we have to

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,810
recalculate a whole set of tables

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,250
because the flight of that projectile is

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,229
governed of course by differential

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,700
equations but we're not expecting the

28
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,390
people in the field to use differential

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,729
equations let's face it most of the

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,630
people that we have drafted don't really

31
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,090
know calculus but the thing is if I know

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,670
that my target is exactly ten thousand

33
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,100
yards due east but I've got some wind

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,450
going north to south well I know I've

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,250
got to point it a little bit north of

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,810
East I've got to figure out the

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,150
elevation of where I'm gonna point it

38
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,799
based on the distance and

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,729
characteristics of the air and all that

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:50,970
has to be done before we can start using

41
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:53,729
those guns to do this the US Army

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,490
employed a couple of sites with a small

43
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:01,200
army of people doing calculations these

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,740
people had the job title computer now as

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,930
you might guess all of the young men who

46
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,149
had just been studying mathematics had

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,440
been shipped off to the front so that

48
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,250
left the labor pool for this team to be

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,609
the young women

50
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,530
who had recently studied mathematics and

51
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,320
this group by the way also competed with

52
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,290
the code-breaking group who was seeking

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,320
to employ people from the same pool now

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,200
we had two groups doing this one was

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,190
located at Aberdeen Maryland and one was

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,440
located at the University of

57
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:41,910
Pennsylvania now the nature of these

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,740
calculations is very tedious you

59
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,770
basically are sitting there operating a

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:53,640
desktop adding machine over and over and

61
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:55,040
over again for hours on end so maybe

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,869
there's a better way to do it

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,829
maybe we can calculate these tables

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,790
faster and that's where the ENIAC comes

65
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:09,570
from in 1943 two people at the

66
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,900
university issued a proposal and said I

67
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,440
think we can build a machine that will

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,580
calculate these tables much much faster

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,700
by using vacuum tubes and the army said

70
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,620
there's a war on we don't care if it's

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,480
practical or if you can actually do it

72
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,440
have some money and try

73
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,530
so they got a six-month contract to kind

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,650
of prove the ideas that evolved into

75
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,350
another series of contracts and finally

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,620
the machine was finished after spending

77
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,410
about a half a million dollars on it and

78
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,560
it began operation in late 1945 so it

79
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,250
actually missed the war but it was still

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,120
a very very useful and important machine

81
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,850
for us it was important in several ways

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,250
one it was a major national computing

83
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,079
resource even before it went into

84
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,269
operation there was a committee set up

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,329
in Washington that would receive

86
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,070
requests for time on the ENIAC and they

87
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,910
would decide who could have time when

88
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,149
and schedule it the other important

89
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,890
thing is this is the machine where we

90
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,130
learned how to build and program

91
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,330
computers whether you call it a computer

92
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,419
or not whether you call it

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,810
stored-program or not that's not really

94
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,169
an

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,180
Fortin question what's clear is this is

96
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:37,349
the machine that we really use to learn

97
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,950
all of that so to start off with this is

98
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:44,610
the ENIAC this is the famous picture of

99
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,200
it that you've probably all seen as far

100
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,180
as I can tell this was actually issued

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,060
as part of the initial press release of

102
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,720
the machine in 1946 when it was unveiled

103
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,880
to the public in the picture it's a

104
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,889
little hard to tell with this one but

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,750
this machine goes back into this room

106
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:06,540
about 32 feet the back wall of it is

107
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,250
about 16 feet long and you can kind of

108
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,770
see the scale of the machine by the

109
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,630
people in the picture now one thing you

110
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,580
will notice is not present in this

111
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:23,430
picture is any form of textual display

112
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,440
there's no mouse no keyboard all of the

113
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,780
input and output were with punch cards

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,910
and the two units on the right hand side

115
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,239
of that picture are the punch and the

116
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,520
reader I'm going to show you a little

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,430
bit more detail of the machine as we go

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,340
on but this just kind of gives you a

119
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,669
little bit of a recap of what I was

120
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:52,229
saying with two additional important

121
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:55,890
points first in 1948 they changed the

122
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:58,409
way the machine operated now the machine

123
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,300
itself as we will see was originally

124
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,729
designed in such a way that to program

125
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,700
it you rewire it but in 1948 they

126
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,450
decided well if we can rewire to solve

127
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,590
problems

128
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,969
why don't we wire it to be a CPU and

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,630
then we can execute instructions

130
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,500
sequentially and that was deployed in

131
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,860
early 1948 and that's the way it ran

132
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,190
until it was retired in 55 it's a little

133
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,770
bit interesting by the way the date for

134
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,729
years it was thought that it was

135
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,289
converted in August of 1948 it's

136
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,580
recently been discovered that it was

137
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,068
actually April of 1948

138
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,710
the reason that's important is that the

139
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:49,930
Manchester baby first ran its first

140
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,818
stored program in June of 1948 so where

141
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,419
we always thought the baby had run

142
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,400
before the ENIAC had done anything in a

143
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,948
sequential instruction form turns out

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,219
the ENIAC actually had come a few months

145
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,639
earlier than the baby the other thing I

146
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,379
want to highlight is even though the

147
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,879
motivation and the justification for the

148
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,030
funding of the machine was artillery

149
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,610
calculation it was designed to be a

150
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,340
general-purpose machine from the very

151
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,840
beginning and they knew they were going

152
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,388
to be doing a lot more than just

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,310
artillery calculations in fact the first

154
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:27,310
major calculation that on the machine

155
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:31,029
was atomic bomb design for Los Alamos

156
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:34,539
and I've mentioned some of the other

157
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:36,870
topics here that ran on the machine one

158
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:40,270
that I had to cut off for space is

159
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,490
supersonic air flow this machine was

160
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,190
used in some of the earliest work

161
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,949
designing supersonic aircraft by

162
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,009
simulating the airflow over the wings so

163
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,289
this was a very very significant machine

164
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,349
both in its application and in what we

165
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,779
learned from it now the two people that

166
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,240
I mentioned who put together this

167
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:04,270
proposal for the army were these two

168
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,159
right here john mauchly and jay presper

169
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:11,250
eckert

170
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:15,370
john mauchly was a physicist at Penn he

171
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,259
had come to Penn and was very interested

172
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,000
in a number of kinds of problems that

173
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,150
were very difficult computational

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,879
problems one of his biggest areas of

175
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,210
interest was weather prediction so if

176
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,159
you think the today's forecasting of

177
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,370
weather is bad imagine what it was like

178
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,078
before there were any computers well

179
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,599
that's the kind of problem he wanted to

180
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:43,899
work on now along this time he started

181
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,720
to teach at Penn he also took a course

182
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,930
one summer it was taught by Eckert on

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,260
the subject of electronics and they

184
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:56,380
really hit it off these two men were the

185
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:01,260
kind of pairing that is sort of well

186
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:04,600
more than the sum of their parts MOC Lee

187
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,660
solve where computation was needed he

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,580
saw how computational machines needed to

189
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,900
be constructed in order to be able to

190
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,070
solve the kinds of problems he was

191
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,459
interested in Eckert was an electronics

192
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,720
genius

193
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,400
together they were able to create a

194
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,820
machine that most people didn't think

195
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,760
was possible and so it's their

196
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,320
leadership that led to the machine now

197
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,990
there are a few other individuals I want

198
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,320
to mention in the course of this on the

199
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,330
Left we have Herman goldstine he was a

200
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,760
captain in the army and he kind of

201
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,940
served as the liaison between the army

202
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,280
and the project at the University

203
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,410
Arthur Burks in the middle he was a

204
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,420
mathematician at the University and was

205
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,920
responsible

206
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,439
his biggest area of responsibility was

207
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,599
the design of the multiplier that we'll

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,230
talk a little bit about later now the

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,170
guy on the right probably most people

210
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,420
have not heard of yet I would say he's

211
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,229
probably one of the most influential

212
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:13,689
people from the work on the ENIAC his

213
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:18,700
name is Harry Husky he passed away only

214
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:22,630
about a year ago at the age of 101 after

215
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,220
the ENIAC project at Penn and he had

216
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,530
some involvement with the follow-on

217
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,680
project the edvac he took a sabbatical

218
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,819
and Schmitt a year in England where he

219
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,219
worked at the National Physical

220
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,690
Laboratory that was the same place Alan

221
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,160
Turing had gone after Bletchley Park

222
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,140
Turing had talked about wanting to

223
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,180
create a computer at NPL Huskie actually

224
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,699
initiated the process of building a

225
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,819
small pilot machine and that is the

226
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,740
machine known as the pilot ace the

227
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,270
machine that by the way is currently in

228
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:01,330
the Computer History Museum in London

229
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,310
after coming back from England Huskie

230
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,339
led the development of a machine called

231
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,619
the siak sorry

232
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,569
back he did the SWAC not the siak the

233
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,279
standards Western automatic computer

234
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,529
National Bureau of Standards created two

235
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,230
computers he led the development of the

236
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,809
one on the west coast he also developed

237
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,559
a machine for Bendix corporation called

238
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:25,469
the g15

239
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:27,910
and then he went to teach at Berkeley

240
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,910
while he was at Berkeley one of his PhD

241
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,660
students was Nicolas vert the creator of

242
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:39,879
Pascal and modular and Oberon and one of

243
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:42,850
his master students was Ken Thompson the

244
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,559
same Ken Thompson who partnered with the

245
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,149
Dennis Ritchie after whom this room is

246
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:53,110
named to develop C in Unix so as I said

247
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:56,699
Huskies influence is extremely deep and

248
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,350
broad and hardly anybody's heard of him

249
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,660
now there are a few other people I want

250
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,809
to mention and these come from that

251
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,860
group of computers who were hired to do

252
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:10,059
the calculations as the machine was

253
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,610
nearing completion

254
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:17,519
they took six of this group and assigned

255
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,860
them to be attached to the ENIAC project

256
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,689
now the idea was this if the kinds of

257
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,179
problems people are going to be running

258
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:26,920
on this machine are like the kinds of

259
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:30,579
problems they've just been spending the

260
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,349
last year or two doing by hand they will

261
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,170
be very comfortable with those kind of

262
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,610
problems and being able to help the

263
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,498
mathematicians and engineers and

264
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,040
physicists put the problems onto the

265
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:45,429
machine and guide the operation of the

266
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,829
machine so the initial plan for their

267
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:50,649
role was more akin to what we think of

268
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,888
as an operator than a programmer the

269
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,410
reality is we didn't quite expect the

270
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,620
need for programming the way we

271
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,230
understand it today quite yet and in

272
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,170
fulfilling their role they essentially

273
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,499
pioneered the role of programming now

274
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:12,969
the first three here kaymakli friend

275
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:15,220
bios or Billis and Jean Bartik these by

276
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,970
the way are their married names most of

277
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,699
the time they were working on the ENIAC

278
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,160
had maiden names kaymakli you might

279
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:26,540
recognize the molly name the reason is

280
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,540
that she did marry John Mauchly

281
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,360
the next three Betty hull burton ruth

282
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,079
lichterman and Marilyn west coughed

283
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,509
these six are often sort of referred to

284
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,508
as the ENIAC programmers of the ENIAC

285
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,639
six there's actually a nice documentary

286
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:47,250
that's been made about them as well as a

287
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,790
broader one about all of the computers

288
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,620
who worked there at World War two

289
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,180
there's a seventh person who have not

290
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,000
been able to find a good picture of that

291
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,569
I do want to mention and that's Adele

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,259
Goldstein she was Herman Goldstein's

293
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:07,319
wife and she while she wasn't one of

294
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,750
these six who had been computers

295
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,878
assigned to the ENIAC she was a

296
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,769
mathematician who worked with the

297
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,529
project and she was responsible for

298
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:19,019
writing the primary technical manual and

299
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,180
this is the manual that really describes

300
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,930
how the machine works in a way that you

301
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,329
need to know to program it

302
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,649
okay so here's some of the statistics

303
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:31,199
that people always like to quote about

304
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,149
the machine you saw in the picture it's

305
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,740
kind of a horseshoe shape if you were to

306
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:39,389
stretch it all out you would have a wall

307
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:42,930
80 feet long and eight feet tall had

308
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:45,329
about 18,000 vacuum tubes in it you

309
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,029
probably at some point will see a more

310
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:51,599
exact number quoted the problem with any

311
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:55,019
exact number is the machine was modified

312
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,879
and evolved over time so exactly when do

313
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,809
you pick the count of the tubes so I

314
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:05,040
just said about 18,000 had a 100

315
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:08,969
kilohertz basic clock to put that in

316
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:17,000
perspective that is 10,000 times slower

317
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:21,410
than a 1 gigahertz clock now that clock

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,360
took 20 cycles to carry out an operation

319
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,610
so while the period of the clock is 10

320
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,310
microseconds the basic operation time

321
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,930
was 200 micro set

322
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,000
well if you invert that of course you

323
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,739
get 5000 operations a second that's

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,810
where you frequently hear the quote that

325
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,120
it could do 5,000 additions per second

326
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,920
but as we'll see it's actually a much

327
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,319
more parallel machine than most people

328
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,550
think and so you could really do quite a

329
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:51,589
bit more than just that the power draw

330
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,589
was about a hundred and fifty kilowatts

331
00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:01,410
something in the neighborhood of 50 to a

332
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,589
hundred houses worth of power now I'm

333
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,360
pretty sure the stories are apocryphal

334
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,029
but back when I first joined the faculty

335
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,069
at Drexel people would tell me stories

336
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:15,120
that the lights in Philadelphia would

337
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:17,790
dim when they turned on the machine now

338
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,600
if you're like me and grew up in the

339
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:24,709
world of 5 volt TTL electronics these

340
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,949
next two lines are kind of scary

341
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:33,239
29 distinct power supplies producing 78

342
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:34,740
distinct voltages and most of those

343
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:41,040
voltages were in the several hundred

344
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:42,600
volt range yeah this is not the kind of

345
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,610
machine you want to be careful about you

346
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,750
know just stick your handing without

347
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,309
watching what you're doing now the basic

348
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,959
architecture of the machine this is kind

349
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,939
of a rundown of the unit's I'm not going

350
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,160
to go through and read that off instead

351
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,559
what I'm gonna do is kind of show you

352
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,740
what's contained in the machine in terms

353
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,540
of pictures now the diagram that's right

354
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,809
here comes from the technical manuals

355
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,510
this is a top view of the machine as it

356
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,889
was configured at the Moore School in

357
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,650
Pennsylvania before it got moved to

358
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,500
Aberdeen Maryland they actually changed

359
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:20,100
the layout slightly when they moved it

360
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:23,939
now the view of the overall machine

361
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:26,969
looks kind of like this and again those

362
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:31,350
sides are 32 feet long in the back is 16

363
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,690
feet long now starting on the left kind

364
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,280
of going around we begin with something

365
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,080
called the initiating unit then we have

366
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
the cycling unit that's kind of neat

367
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
because it's got an oscilloscope

368
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,960
you can select which of the clock

369
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,750
signals you

370
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,140
to look at and see how if it's clocking

371
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,899
correctly the next pair of units are the

372
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,049
master programmer the next pair after

373
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:56,379
that are the function table electronics

374
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,940
now I don't have it in these images here

375
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,220
but if you remember back to that first

376
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,620
picture of it I showed you there were

377
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,120
three instances one quite close to the

378
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,689
foreground where you had a person

379
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,570
standing in front a panel and he was

380
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,640
turning rotary switches those panels

381
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,980
were where you would put function tables

382
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,659
if you needed sines cosines logarithms

383
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,049
that's where you would put that

384
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,570
information so the electronics that sits

385
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,730
behind that panel is those two there

386
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,678
then the last two in this picture two of

387
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,750
the accumulators where most of the

388
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:33,039
computation is done in this view

389
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,320
everything's an accumulator except the

390
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,980
leftmost unit which is the divider

391
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,189
square-root ER you could not only do

392
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,390
division you could do square roots and

393
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,419
they took about the same amount of time

394
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:50,110
it was kind of interesting this is the

395
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:53,830
set of units along the back wall all but

396
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:56,949
the three that are obviously different

397
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,439
are accumulators those other three are

398
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,370
the high-speed multiplier and we'll talk

399
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,520
a little bit about that

400
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,340
high-speed in this case meaning hundreds

401
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,639
of multiplications a second and that by

402
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,428
the way was the statistic that really

403
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,390
caught John Von Neumanns attention if we

404
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:18,520
have time I'll tell you a little bit

405
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:21,370
more about that the next batch is more

406
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,710
accumulators in function tables finally

407
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,610
the last two accumulators and then these

408
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:31,390
last six panels are the interfaces to

409
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,370
the card punch and the card reader they

410
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,929
were referred to as the constant

411
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,840
transmitter that was connected to the

412
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:41,190
card reader and the printer but there

413
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,850
was no actual printer it was a punch

414
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:48,460
however at Aberdeen they had a room next

415
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,549
to it that had a full suite of punch

416
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,110
card processing equipment so when you

417
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,280
wanted to print out your results you

418
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,959
would take your cards

419
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:01,240
carry the next door and print it out on

420
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:04,630
the printer there now it's not a machine

421
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,890
like most of us are used to for one

422
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,380
thing there's no bulk writable memory

423
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,990
the only available storage you had that

424
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,910
was modifiable were the accumulators and

425
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:21,130
there were 20 of those so put yourself

426
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:25,030
into a mindset where when you're writing

427
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:30,010
your code you've got 20 variables to

428
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:32,889
work with that's it well okay if you

429
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,140
really want only five digits each you

430
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,570
could pack two of them into an

431
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,950
accumulator so there wasn't really any

432
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,750
separation between memory and storage

433
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,440
the way we think of our typical CPU

434
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:46,120
memory today the divider square reader

435
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,560
was a little bit on the approximate side

436
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,080
that is the least significant digit

437
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,520
wasn't always exactly correct as I

438
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,199
mentioned the machine was very parallel

439
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:59,440
I love this quote from Limor lemma is a

440
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,480
mathematician who did a number theoretic

441
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,270
project on the machine in the summer of

442
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:08,350
46 it was oriented around prime numbers

443
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,360
and he actually tested the prime numbers

444
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,730
in parallel he did a sieve of

445
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,969
eratosthenes in parallel testing

446
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,770
divisors so he wasn't too happy when

447
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,140
they switched over to the sequential

448
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:24,190
instruction mode of operation so as he

449
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,410
put it von Neumann spoiled it as I said

450
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,590
initially we program it with switches

451
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,350
and wires and if you date back to the

452
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,889
80s you may remember a lot of discussion

453
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:38,050
about dataflow architectures program in

454
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,650
the ENIAC feels a lot like working with

455
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,840
the dataflow architecture I've already

456
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,880
mentioned the cycling unit that

457
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,610
generates the clocks and that you had

458
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,120
the nice oscilloscope for one of the

459
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,419
neat things about it is summed up at the

460
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,939
bottom here these three clocking modes

461
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,040
continuous one ad time and one pulse now

462
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,090
to understand that let me show you what

463
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:06,520
the clocking signals look like each of

464
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,899
the traces in this diagram is one of the

465
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,310
different clocking signal

466
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:14,470
that was output by the cycling unit the

467
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:17,200
top trace you'll notice only has one

468
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,860
pulse all by its lonesome over there and

469
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,360
time slot 17 there's 20 time slots here

470
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,050
that's one of those addition times and

471
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,740
that first trace is what's called the

472
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:32,649
central programming pulse this is the

473
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:37,930
heartbeat of the machine every operation

474
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:39,940
is initiated by one of these pulses most

475
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,600
of the rest of the pulses are actually

476
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:47,110
used to move data around to construct

477
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,080
numbers for example if you'll notice

478
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,790
there's a line you may or not may not be

479
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,560
able to read it labeled 1p then there's

480
00:22:51,790 --> 00:23:00,580
2 P 2 prime P + 4 P those four signals

481
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:04,419
allow you to construct any number from 1

482
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,840
to 9 for example to get 5 I could enable

483
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:11,830
the one P in the for P and a lot of the

484
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,449
internals operated that way now the 10 P

485
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,840
and 9p lines we're gonna look at a

486
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:19,810
little bit more detail in just a minute

487
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,629
but when the clocking was set up in the

488
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:25,149
continuous mode this would run be

489
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,960
freerunning you would see this sequence

490
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:32,050
happening 5000 times a second if you

491
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,030
switched it to the 1 ad time mode then

492
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,060
you had a button you could push and that

493
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:40,360
button would do one of these screens

494
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,850
worth of clocking and if you switch it

495
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,250
to the one pulse time mode it would give

496
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:51,310
one of those 20 time slots so they had

497
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:54,970
planned for single step debugging at the

498
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,669
very beginning and this picture is of a

499
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,290
portable control unit that would allow

500
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,230
them to walk around the Machine and do

501
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,700
that now this is the only photograph

502
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,290
I've been able to find that shows any

503
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,970
detail there are a couple of other

504
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,520
photographs where you can tell it's

505
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:13,600
there if you know what to look for this

506
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:18,639
is my approximation of it on my 3d

507
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,850
printer now I will tell you right off

508
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,260
the bat that as I was exhibiting

509
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,969
this at another event a few months ago I

510
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,190
was glancing at the drawings and

511
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,370
realized the cable doesn't come out the

512
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:35,470
top it's supposed to come out the bottom

513
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,239
other than that this works now this

514
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,970
doesn't plug into a real ENIAC it plugs

515
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,570
into a Raspberry Pi but basically this

516
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,190
is how you could control the machine

517
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,230
this toggle switch would select the

518
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,990
three different clocking modes and then

519
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,850
you had buttons for clearing the machine

520
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:55,450
initiating a computation reading a card

521
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,770
or the single stepping and so you had

522
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,260
single stepping with two different

523
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:01,450
granularities of single stepping the

524
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,760
exhibit I'm gonna have upstairs I'll

525
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,220
have this hooked up so that you're

526
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,870
welcome to come by and control and eniac

527
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:14,020
yourself if you'd like okay so now let's

528
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,520
get a little bit more technical talk a

529
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,700
little bit about how the accumulators

530
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,158
actually work first of all it was a

531
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,600
decimal machine everything was done in

532
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,340
base 10 now the initial idea was this

533
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,189
what we want to do is sort of

534
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,658
effectively lash up a bunch of these

535
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,650
adding machines like people are using

536
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:38,500
and have them operate collectively but

537
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,070
instead of using wheels that turn we're

538
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,429
going to use ring counters and each one

539
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,889
of those will represent one digit so

540
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:51,030
each accumulator had ten digits and a

541
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,350
sign you might think AHA sign-magnitude

542
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,428
nope

543
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:58,870
they have a sign and tens complement a

544
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,780
little bit confusing to our modern eye

545
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,699
but it sad actually works pretty well

546
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,440
you had five possible inputs named by

547
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,490
the five first five letters of the Greek

548
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,169
alphabet two outputs a and s I'll talk a

549
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,360
little bit more about those in a minute

550
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,070
but the idea behind those is if I want

551
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,760
to add something I'll send it out the

552
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,559
aiport

553
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,270
if I want to subtract it I'll send it

554
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,730
out the S port and each of these had 12

555
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:28,330
sets of settings that were referred to

556
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,880
as programs to our mind it's more like

557
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,280
an instruction and essentially what the

558
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,500
operation could be is in putting on one

559
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,750
of the five inputs

560
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,129
in which case you would add that what's

561
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:45,039
coming in on that input to the current

562
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:48,490
value output on a or s or both there's

563
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,210
the zero for no op might wonder why is

564
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,980
there a no op you'll see depending on

565
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,830
time there's a what they call a clear

566
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,539
correct switch that don't have a whole

567
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,370
lot of time to go into it but it clears

568
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,950
after transmitting adds an extra one on

569
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,559
input for handling tins complement and

570
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:09,879
you had a repeat mechanism on most of

571
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:12,970
the programs so let's say I had X in one

572
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:16,240
accumulator and I wanted to add 3x to

573
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,190
the next accumulator well what I would

574
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,899
do is I would activate a program on the

575
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,570
first one that transmitted three times

576
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:25,139
and then it will activate a program on

577
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,168
the second one that received three times

578
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:33,490
so all your small integer constants in

579
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:34,720
the polynomials were handled directly by

580
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:40,360
this you didn't have to go to the

581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,889
multiplier for them now the idea of the

582
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,039
ring counters is well understood at this

583
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:47,408
point you basically create a series of

584
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,980
ten foot flops you arrange them in a

585
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:53,470
circle every pulse moves to the next

586
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,330
flip-flop and when you cross from nine

587
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,279
back to zero you set a carry that goes

588
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,029
over to the next one and these were used

589
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:05,590
quite a lot in devices like counters

590
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:08,850
that were used in radiation research so

591
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:11,408
Eckert was quite familiar with these but

592
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:16,269
here's the interesting question how do

593
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:18,279
you get the data out you see for just an

594
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:22,690
ordinary counter you're expecting a

595
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:25,029
human to read it off you're sending

596
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,490
pulses in to put data there but how do

597
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,230
you get the data out well this is one of

598
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,389
the more clever aspects of the machine I

599
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,039
think and I'm going to talk about

600
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:38,610
exactly how it works in just a minute

601
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,610
but first that's one digit

602
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,310
it was built very modular Lee that's

603
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,280
this was part of Eckert's genius and how

604
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:51,409
he built it but one digits worth of

605
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:56,250
electronics was in one of these trays

606
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:59,160
it's um probably not too far from

607
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:03,270
life-size on that screen it's about

608
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:07,100
three to four feet long and as you can

609
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,780
tell it's got about 20 tubes on it and

610
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:13,169
there were ten of these per accumulator

611
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:16,290
and as I said 20 accumulators so there

612
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:18,000
were 200 of these digits that were just

613
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:20,340
the date of being operated on

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,250
not to mention all similar structures

615
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:28,740
for control and counting repeats and so

616
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:32,090
on now within that unit then if I want

617
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,530
to read the data out how do I do it well

618
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,070
remember I've got the a output in the S

619
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,720
output a is what I want to do things

620
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,610
additively s is what I want to do

621
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,870
subtractive Li so what I wouldn't really

622
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,699
want to do is I want to send the data

623
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:51,929
value out the a and I want to send the

624
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,520
9s complement out the s another way to

625
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,640
think of that is I've got a total of

626
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,410
mind pulses I want to send I want to

627
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,940
send some of them out the a and some of

628
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:05,070
them out the S well that turns out to be

629
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,070
what those two lines that I said I'd

630
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,320
come back to are all about the first of

631
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,679
those that you see on the bottom here

632
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,659
has ten pulses that causes the counters

633
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,110
to wrap around back to where they

634
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,180
started so when you're reading data out

635
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,310
you essentially give every digit ten

636
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,600
pulses it goes all the way back around

637
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:29,820
to where it started now in between each

638
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,070
pair of those ten there's another one

639
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,080
total of nine and we're going to route

640
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:38,100
some of them out the s and some of them

641
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,800
out the a and the cleverness is all we

642
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:44,040
have to do is use the carry to select

643
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,440
which when we start sending the pulses

644
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,450
we start sending them out the S and then

645
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,830
as soon as the carry gets set we flip

646
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,559
that switch and the rest of them go out

647
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,499
the a and the effect is we've

648
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,529
the data value out the a port and the 9s

649
00:30:55,499 --> 00:31:00,389
complement out the S port and that's how

650
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:03,539
we transfer data to another unit and

651
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:06,090
carry out the actual arithmetic and that

652
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:10,289
this is really kind of the central core

653
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:12,509
of how this machine worked now I'm going

654
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:17,220
to illustrate it for you here in this

655
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:19,590
simulator of the machine now first thing

656
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:23,370
I'll tell you is that this is not an

657
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:28,019
actual photograph of the machine this is

658
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:30,779
constructed from many photographs I went

659
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,470
through a lot of photographs slicing out

660
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,999
the best pieces of each one I could find

661
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,360
correcting for any proportion of

662
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:42,869
distortion and then built a ray tracer

663
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,199
to image the overall views of it so

664
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:48,209
that's where these images come from now

665
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,679
what I'm going to be doing remember in

666
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,090
this image we have the divider of square

667
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,740
reader then we have some accumulators

668
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:57,509
I'm going to be using the first three of

669
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,610
those accumulators now the first thing

670
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:04,759
I'm going to do is load a value into the

671
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:07,789
first one and if you look closely some

672
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:10,619
of the lights on that first one changed

673
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:12,720
the rightmost column now has the light

674
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:14,340
moved up to the position 5 and the next

675
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,940
one over to the position 1 this is

676
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,009
showing the number 15 now

677
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,059
I've loaded the number 27 now into the

678
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:26,009
other two accumulators so what I'm going

679
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,960
to do is I'm going to read out the value

680
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,519
from the 15 I'm going to add it to one

681
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,830
of them and subtract it from the other

682
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,259
so to do that I'm going to switch the

683
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,470
mode to the pulse mode so you can watch

684
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:39,840
it happening one step at a time and as

685
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm doing it you will see all of the

686
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,019
values in the first one moving up as

687
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,658
they roll around to their starting point

688
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:50,450
until a carry is set they go to the

689
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,909
third one

690
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,529
once the carry is set in whatever column

691
00:32:53,909 --> 00:33:02,159
that is the pulses will go to the second

692
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:05,250
one and the net effect now ok I'm almost

693
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,360
done I've got all of the data read out

694
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,159
of the first one up

695
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,709
things added up into the second one I've

696
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,870
got some carries to deal with so we'll

697
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:18,779
deal with the carries and now we have

698
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:22,229
the results the second accumulator has

699
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,809
the value 42 that was the sum of 27 and

700
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,630
15 and the third one has the value 12

701
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,519
which is their difference so here we've

702
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,289
done a little bit of parallelism in this

703
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,470
illustration where we did an addition

704
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:37,760
and a subtraction simultaneously so

705
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:41,130
that's kind of the core of how it works

706
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,779
I'll have this example at the table if

707
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,340
you want to come by and actually step

708
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:49,590
through it yourself and look at how

709
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:52,490
things work briefly I want to say a few

710
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,178
words also about the multiplier

711
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,480
basically it was all built around

712
00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:00,720
multiplication tables just like what you

713
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,090
learned in the second grade so there's

714
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,600
this table that understands all the

715
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:12,359
multiples of say 4 it understands that 1

716
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:14,219
times 4 is 4 2 is 8 12 16 and so on now

717
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:17,219
those are separated into their tens

718
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,138
digit in their ones digit so as this

719
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,089
operates what it does is it takes a

720
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:24,869
digit multiplies it by the whole

721
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,520
multiple cand says now let me add up the

722
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,929
tens digits let me add up the ones

723
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,820
digits when I get done with the whole

724
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,149
thing I'll add those together and that

725
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,770
will give me the product I'm not going

726
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,859
to get into all of the details of how it

727
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,810
does it but if you take a look at these

728
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,379
slides and all have been posted for you

729
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,389
later there's an example that kind of

730
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:51,270
works out exactly how that happens one

731
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:53,490
step at a time now the master programmer

732
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,199
is really where this machine became

733
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:59,310
quite unique relative to its

734
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,049
contemporaries a lot of people had

735
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:04,200
thought in terms of let me build

736
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,369
something that can crunch a lot of

737
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,080
additions and subtractions and

738
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:13,589
multiplications but in the ENIAC they

739
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,330
knew they needed repetition and they

740
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,700
needed they needed to be able to control

741
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,900
that repetition and that was the role of

742
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:23,569
the master program

743
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:28,400
essentially what you had was a set of

744
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:30,710
six structures sorry take them back ten

745
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,990
structures each of which had six stages

746
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:36,740
and each of those six stages could be a

747
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:38,990
loop so you could actually have fairly

748
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,520
complex nested loop structures if you

749
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,919
wanted to make it even more interesting

750
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,829
you could feed data into the master

751
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:54,920
programmer and as a result actually have

752
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:56,329
it make a logical decision and we're not

753
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,710
going to have time so I won't run

754
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,970
through the example of it here but if

755
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,160
you want to come by the table I can show

756
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,589
you an example of a case where it

757
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,690
actually takes two numbers compares them

758
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:08,990
and decides which is the greater and

759
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:11,599
this was something that the ENIAC had

760
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:14,180
that it could do that you really didn't

761
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,770
see in other machines the Harvard mark

762
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,118
one for example had the same sort of

763
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,430
addition structure a had a special

764
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:27,099
multiplier it had the idea of function

765
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:30,259
tables it had a sort of idea of loops

766
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:32,900
where literally they took the stock of

767
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:39,980
the punch card wrapped it around into a

768
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:41,960
loop and that was a loop but it didn't

769
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,079
really have a way of conditional

770
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:50,270
branching and that's what made the ENIAC

771
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:52,369
so unique I mentioned the programming

772
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,759
I'll just show you quickly what this

773
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:58,060
programming looks like when you go to

774
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,060
probe

775
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:05,700
you do it with diagrams you don't have a

776
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:09,089
sequential list of operations instead

777
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:13,589
what we're doing is saying how do the

778
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:17,720
signals go from one place to another the

779
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:25,410
lines across the top our data trunks

780
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:27,149
each of those is 11 cables in this tray

781
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:31,379
and these are the ones right here in

782
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:34,260
this diagram these connectors have 12

783
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,859
physicians so you've got the 11 and a

784
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,960
ground the connections down here are

785
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,848
four control signals and each of the

786
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,650
eleven signals there is individually

787
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:46,440
accessible and those are what we have

788
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,809
drawn on the bottom of the figure so

789
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,440
what happens is when we're looking at a

790
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:56,309
control pulse that say for example comes

791
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:59,099
out of in this case the initiating

792
00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:01,829
operation then it will travel and

793
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:04,770
trigger an operation here on the master

794
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:06,990
program and when it's done it triggers

795
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,279
something on the next stage and so on so

796
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,808
let's look at that last one

797
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:14,490
this bottom control line here the output

798
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,319
feeding it is coming from the master

799
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,689
programmer so it says I want to do an

800
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,119
operation now the particular operation

801
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,240
is going to be calculating the square of

802
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,520
a number and it's going to do it using

803
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,149
our favorite little equation that n plus

804
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,470
1 squared is N squared plus 2 n plus 1

805
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,680
so if I've already got in squared I want

806
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,140
to add 2 in and I want to add 1 so this

807
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,200
is the first step is going to add that 2

808
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,690
in and you'll notice what's happening

809
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,538
here this control line right here is

810
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:48,059
going to correspond to this output

811
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:50,250
operation a so it says this accumulators

812
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,380
value is going to be transmitted over

813
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,980
here and it's going to transmit two

814
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:00,180
times that same control signal causes

815
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,220
this one to read it two times and then

816
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,288
when it's finished it sends this output

817
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,558
control signal to start the next step

818
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:11,119
which is the add one so that's the way

819
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,119
you think about programming the Na

820
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:16,599
just to give you a little sense of

821
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,630
what's more involved this is that

822
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,750
maximum one that I was talking about

823
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,280
doing the taking two numbers subtracting

824
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,780
them and basically making a decision

825
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,940
based on whether the result of that

826
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,599
subtraction is negative or non-negative

827
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:35,950
and the interesting thing is that we can

828
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:39,520
pull out the sign of the number and then

829
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:42,520
feed it in as a control signal that

830
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,770
turns out to be the central mechanism

831
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:52,119
that we use for the more complex kinds

832
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:53,859
of programming on the ENIAC okay so as I

833
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,569
said the programming the way we've been

834
00:39:53,859 --> 00:40:01,869
talking about is the way it was done

835
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:05,440
before 1948 in 1948 several things have

836
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:10,900
been going on now I'm going to back up

837
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:13,020
to start that story in 1944 the enact

838
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,250
project is well underway by now

839
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,980
Eckert and Mauchly are already starting

840
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:23,470
to think about their next machine the

841
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:26,619
one that's called the edvac now at the

842
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,270
same time john von neumann is very

843
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,490
deeply involved with the army and

844
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:36,549
computational problems especially in

845
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:39,640
terms of assisting Los Alamos so one day

846
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:42,579
on the train platform in Aberdeen Herman

847
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,799
goldstine sees John von Neumann and goes

848
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:47,049
up and introduces himself and starts

849
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:49,480
talking about this machine and von

850
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:50,500
Neumann is just kind of nodding along

851
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:56,740
not paying a whole lot of attention

852
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:58,900
until Goldstein says yeah and we can do

853
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,899
5,000 additions a second several hundred

854
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,440
multiplications a second and that got

855
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,970
von neumann's attention because he knew

856
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,380
nothing else he had been working with

857
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:14,618
could compute that fast so he got really

858
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:19,119
interested in the project well it ended

859
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:23,000
up being August of 1944 before he got

860
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,340
his clearances to go see any ACK yeah

861
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,660
I was a Cartman compartmentalization

862
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,370
this guy who was doing stuff with atomic

863
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:33,500
bombs couldn't go see the in a context

864
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:36,650
so anyway he comes in and and kind of

865
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,630
joins the project well by this time

866
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,580
Eckert and Mauchly have already been

867
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,670
doing a lot of thinking about the design

868
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,610
of the edvac and they've already been

869
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,220
thinking about the idea of memory in

870
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:52,880
fact in January of 1944 Eckert had

871
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,830
written a small paper about a way of

872
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,680
doing memory that essentially amounts to

873
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:00,290
magnetic disks and he had a little

874
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,970
sentence in there that said oh and the

875
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:09,980
sequence of operations could be stored

876
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:12,919
on this now when von Neumann gets there

877
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,360
he realizes and to some extent I'm going

878
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,660
to be reading into it what I believe

879
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:20,630
happened because von Neumann knew alan

880
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,859
turing remember von neumann was at the

881
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,670
Institute for Advanced Studies at

882
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:31,430
Princeton Turing did his PhD at

883
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:35,000
Princeton so von Neumann knew him he

884
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:38,120
knew of the results in the on computable

885
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,100
numbers paper and I believe that von

886
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,130
Neumann saw what Eckert and Mauchly were

887
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:48,470
talking about and realized if we do it

888
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:49,940
right this could be that Universal

889
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:54,649
machine from the own computable numbers

890
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:56,600
paper so you will see everybody who

891
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,520
talks about von neumann's involvement

892
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,370
will talk about his focus on the

893
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:08,210
instruction set I'm pretty sure that's

894
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:14,180
why so anyway he is consulting with the

895
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:17,480
edvac project in time Eckert and Mauchly

896
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:21,410
leave the university essentially both

897
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,700
sound to a patent dispute I'll have to

898
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,350
tell you the story later if you want to

899
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,169
come upstairs and see it but basically

900
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,910
they leave the university von neumann

901
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,850
goes off to the is does create a new

902
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,230
machine and in the process of doing so

903
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,900
he says you know what I bet we could

904
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,040
invert the ENIAC to be like a

905
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:42,110
stored-program

906
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:44,390
and that sort of impetus where I think

907
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,150
he also used it as a testbed for ideas

908
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,129
is what led to that conversion in 1948

909
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,690
and as I said that's the way it ran

910
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:55,910
until the end of its life one last thing

911
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:00,980
that was done to the Machine is there

912
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:04,870
was a memory added to it in 1953 they

913
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:10,370
bought a memory unit of core memory and

914
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:16,130
we now had 100 memory locations clearly

915
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:17,930
our memory problems are over I mean

916
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,830
let's face it you only need a hundred

917
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:24,190
right I mean that's what Babbage said 64

918
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:26,920
squares on a chessboard that leaves you

919
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:32,030
36 variables to calculate the next move

920
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,610
surely that's enough so anyway that was

921
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:40,580
basically the ENIAC until as I said it

922
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:43,220
got retired in 1955 in the meantime this

923
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,750
space by the way where it was put was

924
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,520
one of the few places in the area that

925
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,560
had air-conditioning so a number of

926
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,180
people moved their desks in and started

927
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,310
using it as an office toward the end of

928
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:57,109
its life by the clock I have sitting in

929
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:03,160
front of me we have one minute for a

930
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:05,870
question and I can't see anybody so

931
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,290
Grace Hopper okay

932
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:12,620
Grace Hopper fits into the picture is a

933
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:14,029
little bit of a side thing when I said

934
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,589
that Eckert and Mauchly left the

935
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,270
university they went started another

936
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:21,890
company called the Eckert multi computer

937
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:24,080
corporation one of their early employees

938
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:26,509
was Grace Hopper who had worked for

939
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:30,290
Aiken at Harvard on the Harvard mark one

940
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:32,030
in the mark two so she joined Eckert

941
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:35,330
machlin computer corporation working as

942
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:38,840
a programmer on the UNIVAC machines and

943
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:41,450
it was while she was there that she sort

944
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,050
of pioneered the ideas that we think of

945
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:47,689
as compilers today and of course then

946
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,490
she went on to have her famous talks

947
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,500
that she would

948
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:54,580
of where she would pass out her famous

949
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,140
nanoseconds and those prized possession

950
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,840
nanoseconds of course are in people's

951
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,180
wills now I unfortunately never got over

952
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,150
nanosecond from her somebody like to

953
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:07,330
give me one I'll take it the last thing

954
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:11,080
I'll say is that the parts of the innie

955
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,549
act today are scattered quite widely but

956
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,319
there are those of us who believe the

957
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,300
right thing to do is to return it all to

958
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,090
Philadelphia restore it to running

959
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,560
condition and put it on display if you'd

960
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:24,350
like to help out with that especially

961
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:36,420
financially come see me thank you

962
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:36,420
[Applause]
