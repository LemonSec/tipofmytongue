1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
I'm always a little surprised when a

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,589
talk and wine actually gets accepted

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,359
because I'm not sure it's actually it's

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,400
interesting to anybody else as it is to

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,620
me it certainly seems less important

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,210
than a lot of stuff is going on but

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,919
thank you for coming and I'm gonna try

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,809
and make this as quick as informative as

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
possible

10
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,830
before I start a big thanks to everybody

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,750
at hope for doing all the stuff they do

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,889
someone had to hang those lights you

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,769
know the sound in the back of the room

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,590
it is ace right so thank you to the

15
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,598
whole people yeah thank you to all the

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,308
a/v and everybody behind the scenes that

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,660
we don't even know because they're doing

18
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,140
their job so while we're not even

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,629
noticing it so thank you everybody so

20
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,730
when I was preparing this talk a minute

21
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,110
after I submitted it I realized there's

22
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,819
a better name for this talk which is

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,800
sensor overload because I way too many

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,989
sensors to talk about they're all fun

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,538
they're all cool and some cool stuff you

26
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,160
can do with them so this is kind of

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,340
firehose I'm gonna go pretty quickly

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,230
there's no real good way to arrange all

29
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,149
this material there's no good skewer

30
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,010
through this shish kebab so I've kind of

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,539
arranged it like this it's not actually

32
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,179
a three-day talk although I could talk

33
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,830
for three days we're gonna start kinda

34
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,020
with photo sensors just stuff you can do

35
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,429
optically we're gonna do chips and MEMS

36
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,619
and then there are all kinds of other

37
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,500
crazy stuff and then finally we get back

38
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,610
to optical stuff again so a little bit

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,560
about me

40
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,619
credentials don't matter I'm a tinkerer

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm a hacker I do robots for fun and I

42
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,790
do robots for a living I like making art

43
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,949
robots I like making cocktail robots

44
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,930
these things here that you're seeing are

45
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,659
not actually cocktail robots these or

46
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,549
surgical robots these are these are

47
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,650
prototypes of a system that uses a

48
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,470
high-pressure water jet to remove tissue

49
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,210
and this is probably the most terrifying

50
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,000
day of my life where they're using my

51
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,339
janky code on a real human being all

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,680
right so I need to reassure you that

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,270
once we got funding for this company

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,890
it's called Pro Set bio robotics they

55
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,450
hired the grownups and the people who

56
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,790
knew what they were doing so there's no

57
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,500
chance of my janky code getting anywhere

58
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,110
near your tender bits so um so relax

59
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,068
your mind and let's float downstream on

60
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,690
the fire hose okay I'm going to talk as

61
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,030
I said about the first part is going to

62
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,329
be optical sensors now everybody has

63
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,040
seen these or used

64
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,320
and they turn out to be kind of

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,910
everywhere that first thing at the top

66
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,709
there that's you just have a LED which

67
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,870
shines on the photo dial the photodiode

68
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,060
looks like a switch when the light hits

69
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,980
it it turns on this is easy to interface

70
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,050
to a microcontroller to an Arduino you

71
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,780
needs a couple resistors but a bunch of

72
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,580
how to's you see this everywhere

73
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,350
the that kind of interrupter thing

74
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,330
there's one in your printer that tells

75
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,220
you when it's out of paper on this thing

76
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,160
in the in the middle there there's one

77
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,510
in in the in the bathroom which flushes

78
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,280
the toilet when you stand up where it's

79
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,850
supposed to do that right sometimes it

80
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,770
doesn't so so this kind of thing where

81
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,730
you have this either this interrupted

82
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,770
thing where you have a beam of light

83
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,119
which is blocked or you bounce a beam of

84
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,100
light off something else you pick it up

85
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,310
very common design pattern we'll see it

86
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,960
a lot here's something I did with this

87
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,240
kind of retro reflective thing there's a

88
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,750
whole bunch of sensors arranged in a

89
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,670
sphere that you can do cool things with

90
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,250
this is a recent interest this is called

91
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,619
PPG let me see if I can not mess this up

92
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,150
but just a photo place of the mograph

93
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:25,030
which basically measures your heartbeat

94
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,890
by detecting when your heart pumps blood

95
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,640
through your finger or another part of

96
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,670
your extremity

97
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,100
it absorbs more or less light and you

98
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,750
can detect that with an optical sensor

99
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,820
there's this transmissive thing goes

100
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,380
right through your finger and there's

101
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,269
also a reflective thing this is what on

102
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,390
your Fitbit what on your what's on your

103
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,520
Apple watch this is kind of hard to do

104
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,589
because the actual change is very very

105
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,180
small and so you need to do a little bit

106
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,640
of finesse to actually pick up that

107
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,410
signal but you can do it here is

108
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,350
something that you can buy it's not very

109
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,209
expensive if you want to experiment with

110
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,070
this stuff yourself I got one of these

111
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,600
because I'm doing an art project using

112
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,780
this to make stuff beat in time with

113
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,519
your heart I also got this which is

114
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,920
super call this is a cool this is a

115
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,530
pulse oximeter this measures how much

116
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,809
oxygen is in your blood as well as your

117
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,709
pulse in real time and has streaming

118
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:20,140
data this was very inexpensive my doctor

119
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,460
wanted $400 for something like this for

120
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,080
one night and you can buy this for 30

121
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,710
thirty bucks and worked for a week and

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,710
get used to it

123
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,919
the V software came with was not great

124
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,509
so I cracked it

125
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,190
I didn't crack it I just

126
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,770
man-in-the-middle the serial protocol

127
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,699
wasn't hard if you want to do this it's

128
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,460
online my github see what is next

129
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,430
optical encoders these are super fun

130
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,430
they're everywhere every robot arm that

131
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,039
has a joint has to know where it is what

132
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,570
angle it is at and this is quite often

133
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,240
how they do it using these optical

134
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,969
encoders and these are very easy to

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,979
interface to a microcontroller you have

136
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,720
these two of these interrupter things

137
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,340
and they're interrupted by this slotted

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,699
disk you can see in that middle picture

139
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,198
there when when they turn in one

140
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,490
direction they're in one phase and when

141
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,199
you turn the other direction the other

142
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,419
phase so typically what you do is you

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,910
put one of the signals to trigger the

144
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,590
interrupt and when in the interrupt you

145
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,330
look at the phase of the other signals

146
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,429
if it's hide you increment a counter if

147
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,800
it's low you decrement the counter super

148
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,020
easy really works but these don't tell

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,880
you where you are they only tell you how

150
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,099
far you've turned since the last time

151
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,520
you knew where you were and we'll talk

152
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:39,409
about that later but here's a project

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,020
that I did actually my friend Charlie

154
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,460
made this giant thing using hydraulics

155
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,219
and we didn't want to crush any

156
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,109
coachella bros so we made a 12 this

157
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,110
thing is giant and it moves with

158
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,880
hydraulics there's a 12 different joints

159
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,770
on them and did a little feedback thing

160
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,199
with that optical encoder to tell you

161
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,299
how far that was over and whether to

162
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,780
turn on or turn off that hydraulic valve

163
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,090
to move it to the place it should be

164
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,638
okay this is something little fun this

165
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,369
is a distance sensor that uses optical

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,930
thing it basically bounces off something

167
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,820
in front of it and measures kind of the

168
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,080
angle I'm not actually quite sure how

169
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,759
these work I think there's a little

170
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,930
micro prism array in there one of these

171
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,389
days they'll take one apart and figure

172
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,970
it out but these are not expensive these

173
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,889
are fun I can imagine all kinds of uses

174
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,690
for these or maybe someone will put up

175
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,460
put one on a conference badge and

176
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,560
measure how far the person is in front

177
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,340
of you you might have to discount for

178
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,840
the reflector

179
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,369
of black t-shirts but you know maybe

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,780
light up a little LED depending on how

181
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,820
close they are to your personal space

182
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,900
and you can kind of dial that in I don't

183
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,400
know all kinds of fun stuff you can do

184
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,880
sometimes you don't need a camera to get

185
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,870
to pick up light this is kind of a 1

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,200
pixel camera this color sensor shout-out

187
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,240
to out of fruit for open-source hardware

188
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,580
and making this really easy to use and

189
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,850
there's code on the Adafruit website for

190
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,650
using these sensors this is a one pixel

191
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:16,060
camera it has 16 bit color resolution

192
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:18,289
red green blue and all bandwidth and

193
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,250
you'll notice on the right there that

194
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:24,860
thing that says s CL and SC s da that is

195
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,180
a very standard serial protocol called I

196
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,770
squared C it makes it really easy to use

197
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,830
quite often somebody has a library for

198
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,620
interfacing in this picture on the lower

199
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:39,950
right there that's Arduino and you see

200
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,080
the SE ASDA and the SEL of serial data

201
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,880
and serial clock all you have to do is

202
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,099
hook those up and make sure you're on a

203
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,680
common ground and things will usually

204
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,690
work the first time it's kind of amazing

205
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,030
and almost all these sensors that I'm

206
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,700
presenting somebody has already written

207
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,590
a driver you basically talk to them by

208
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,570
writing registers and somebody's figured

209
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,669
all that out or it's not too hard to do

210
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,950
that by reading the datasheet all this

211
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,190
stuff is pretty easy to use surprisingly

212
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,780
easy okay here's an application of a

213
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,469
color sensor that I think is super great

214
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:17,780
this was a interactive installation done

215
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,890
by Micah Scott scanline that thing on

216
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,530
the right there that's a giant

217
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,300
interactive wall and those those things

218
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,809
are knobs you turn them those circular

219
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,060
discs so she needed a lot of position

220
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,700
sensors to detect what angle that these

221
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,070
things were at and so she did this

222
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,799
ingenious hack with a color sensor she

223
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,690
printed out these colored sheets behind

224
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,819
these things and they're big and then so

225
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,320
depending on what color the color sensor

226
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,880
since you could tell what angles these

227
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,460
were they didn't need to be very precise

228
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,890
but this looked very robust and this is

229
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,089
away this is a really nice hack so I

230
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,670
love this

231
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,980
see what else cameras cameras a whole

232
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,520
talk in themselves just a couple things

233
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,920
I wanted to point out Raspberry Pi in Pi

234
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,680
cam there's this thing called motion iOS

235
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,779
which lets you do a streaming camera if

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,370
you want one for your doorbell or your

237
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,460
laundry room or something you don't want

238
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,560
to be part of a botnet or at least less

239
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,200
likely to be part of a botnet you can

240
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,579
roll your own and that's super cool

241
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,260
OpenCV computer vision library very

242
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,010
powerful people been working on that for

243
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,540
twenty years does really amazing stuff

244
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,220
Yolo is a neural network recognition

245
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,569
library I haven't used it myself but the

246
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,630
demos look really awesome this thing

247
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,700
works at 30 frames per second and it can

248
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,350
detect things like bicycles a car or

249
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,680
that funny shaped cat there and that

250
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,320
picture there um and there's also other

251
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,130
things cameras that use a structured

252
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,540
light to to detect depth and that's like

253
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,130
the real sense and the Kinect that's a

254
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,630
little bit out of scope of this talk but

255
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,990
I thought I'd mention minute mention

256
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,300
them anyway moving on open MD camera

257
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,310
this is a camera with a super powerful

258
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,560
ARM processor that's doing some image

259
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,880
processing right on the board you can

260
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,790
take this and hook it up to an Arduino

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,990
there are people doing DIY Robo cars who

262
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,560
are racing around and I think this one

263
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,750
one the last one they're basically

264
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,420
following a race track autonomously and

265
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,920
they race these things in Oakland pretty

266
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,170
much every month and they're doing

267
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,939
pretty well just using using hardware

268
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:24,650
like this if you want your own

269
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,690
forward-looking infrared camera you can

270
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,920
make one using the lepton sensors I

271
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,830
think all this stuff is kind of

272
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,360
encumbered by patents and military HR

273
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,390
restrictions so it's kind of great that

274
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,550
you can do this stuff yourself it seems

275
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,580
like this might be the killer app for um

276
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,140
for autonomous vehicles because they can

277
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,450
see pedestrians at night which is a

278
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,339
handy thing to do but there is some

279
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,140
restrictions on that I don't know the

280
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:52,670
full details of that but seems like the

281
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:56,000
natural solution you can also do detect

282
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,680
UV the one on the right people put them

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,320
on wearable

284
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,939
to detect on how much Sun you're getting

285
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,770
are you in danger of getting sunburned

286
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,390
or something I think this would be a

287
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,010
great DEFCON badge where it kind of

288
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:12,010
resets your score if you actually see

289
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:14,260
sunlight right so okay and the here's

290
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,300
here's another thing super cool this is

291
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,319
a little light are right this is doing

292
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,390
time of flight and remember like a

293
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,029
nanosecond is 18 inches and this this is

294
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,040
accurate down to millimeters like 10

295
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,410
millimeters uh apparently the range of

296
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,959
this is something like it's from the

297
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,790
datasheet it's a 15 centimeter Sparkfun

298
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,640
says they get it out to 25 centimeters

299
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,529
but the fact that you can do this on

300
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,660
this tiny little thing that's like four

301
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,029
by eight millimeters is just amazing so

302
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,219
if you want to put a distance sensor on

303
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,020
your badge you got lasers you got

304
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,790
frickin lasers on your badge right

305
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,670
that'd be great

306
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,709
speaking of freaking lasers this is also

307
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,329
stuff I haven't used but the the the

308
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,029
prices of these things are dramatic

309
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,800
these um these lidar sensors some are

310
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,540
1d some are two DS they'll give you

311
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,459
depth maps at at some amazing framerate

312
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,689
and the prices of these are just amazing

313
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,250
some of these used to be hundred

314
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,800
thousand dollars not too long ago but

315
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,870
there seems to be an arms race to make

316
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,300
these cheap and great and this is great

317
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,459
if you're doing autonomous robots if

318
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,650
you're doing simultaneously location and

319
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,109
mapping you need one of these not

320
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,110
something I know much about but I think

321
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,560
the prices of these are just amazing all

322
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,860
right one final couple of optical things

323
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,660
is this optical gesture sensor once

324
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,060
again it says tiny little package just a

325
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,760
couple square millimeters and this this

326
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,219
has basically a camera in it and it can

327
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,480
detect little wave gestures you don't

328
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,610
need a microcontroller or anything

329
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,350
that's just right there so once again

330
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,089
something for your badge life thing you

331
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,340
can detect like Jedi mind tricks and

332
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,380
things like that

333
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:57,750
or put this in a beer dispensing robot

334
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,880
or say give me some beer let me see one

335
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,529
final thing to talk about in the optical

336
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,170
thing just because it's so cool it's

337
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:07,380
this lighthouse thing this was designed

338
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,660
by Allen Yates who's on Twitter he is a

339
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,150
some kind of mad genius of the

340
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,339
electrical arts and the way this thing

341
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,470
works is super cool so it's got a

342
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,050
synchronization beacon and those are

343
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,330
those those rows of LEDs and then it's

344
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,520
got two rotating beacons and what you do

345
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,190
is you is you see the flash from the

346
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,470
synchronization beacon and then you see

347
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,820
how much time elapses until you see one

348
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,040
of the rotating beacons which are

349
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,750
directional and that gives you the angle

350
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,459
that you are to this thing and then you

351
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,670
get the other beacon which gives you the

352
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,770
other angles so you have a elevation and

353
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,719
azimuth or something with two of these

354
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,089
lighthouses you do some trigonometry you

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,529
know where you are in 3d space and if

356
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,300
you have two of these sensors you have

357
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,890
six degrees of freedom because you know

358
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,150
which direction you're pointing cuz you

359
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,150
have the two ends of a rod or something

360
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:58,110
like that so you don't even have to buy

361
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:02,010
a a V or something to get this because

362
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,839
people have reverse-engineered or made

363
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,450
sensors for this Trammell Hudson who I

364
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,060
think hangs out at NYC resistor yeh

365
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,750
hackerspaces has the circuit right here

366
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,699
and in triad semiconductor sells this

367
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,860
chip which does some of that a lot of

368
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,440
the hard work of the decoding for you

369
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,910
you still need to do some math and stuff

370
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,650
to figure this out but this is something

371
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,120
you can homebrew which is kind of

372
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,810
amazing because this is a really neat

373
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,730
system it does some great resolution at

374
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,439
some really high frame rate like 60

375
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,320
Hertz or something like that kind of

376
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,150
amazing all right I'm gonna direct the

377
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
fire hose in a little bit of a different

378
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,260
direction getting away from optical

379
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,760
stuff how we doing on time doing pretty

380
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,400
good all right um

381
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,640
not everything has to be so complicated

382
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,010
like that sensor you know save room in

383
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,529
your designs for the humble switch which

384
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,970
almost always works you just close a

385
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,730
switch and you can detect that with a

386
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,280
microcontroller you don't need some

387
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,410
fancy RFID or face detection if you want

388
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,589
to only operate a dangerous machine when

389
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,689
you're

390
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,480
standing in a safe place put a floor

391
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,890
switch that only activates when you

392
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,220
stand on it or if you're doing

393
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,260
interactive art or something like that

394
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,600
do not let the super-complicated be the

395
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,030
enemy of the cheap and easy which quite

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,120
often are switches also cheap and easy

397
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,130
are resistive sensors you can use these

398
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,500
for position sensors you turn that knob

399
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,500
the resistance changes you can make a

400
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,800
resistor divider and change that into

401
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,170
voltage which you can easily pick up

402
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,410
with an Arduino and a DC you can get a

403
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,589
slider this is how a hobby servo knows

404
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,969
what direction the act the actuator is

405
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:46,740
it's got a tiny little potentiometer in

406
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,080
there that's number three on that bottom

407
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,960
image and these are fun to hack you can

408
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,850
take them apart and the the the little

409
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,670
feedback thing which moves the motor

410
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,350
until that pot gives you the right

411
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,319
number you can do things if you wanted a

412
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,960
linear actuator you could take apart a

413
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,880
hobby servo make it drive say a lead

414
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,120
screw put the lead screw on that linear

415
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,439
slider on the top right and and the

416
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,540
feedback would still work they would

417
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,340
drive them over until it sees the right

418
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,829
voltage from that slider which puts it

419
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,710
in a particular place so these are fun

420
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,300
to hack I completely recommend taking

421
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,020
apart because they're cheap just to see

422
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,359
how they work soft sensors in fabric

423
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,480
anything that conducts basically as a

424
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,790
potential switch and Adafruit cells are

425
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,590
conductive thread you can sew that into

426
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,420
your the tips that your fingertips of

427
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,200
your gloves you can use the iPhone when

428
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,300
it's cold out or you can put you can put

429
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,220
sensors on your sleeve and make make a

430
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:49,770
piano somebody was selling drum pants

431
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,420
out of fruit also sells touch resistive

432
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,970
fabric the harder you push on this

433
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,729
fabric it decreases the resistance and

434
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,430
you can use that for buttons and

435
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,790
switches and sliders and dials and

436
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,399
things super fun this is one of my

437
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,829
favorite sensors because it's free right

438
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,160
it costs almost nothing basically this

439
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,530
is a capacitive sensor which just ataxic

440
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,070
passes a capacitance of your body by

441
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,109
touching a conductor which can be

442
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,970
as simple as a wire soldered to a

443
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,280
microcontroller most microcontrollers

444
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:26,410
come with a library that do capacitive

445
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,760
sensing look at Mitch Altman's cool art

446
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,830
do touch he's got a little keyboard

447
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,560
there that's pure capacitive sensing you

448
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,970
don't need any extra equipment or

449
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,090
sensors and anything just just a

450
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,840
conductive pad there are some chips that

451
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,490
are designed to do exactly this seed

452
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,280
studio has a breakout for one of them

453
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,610
super easy and my favorite price which

454
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,170
is close to free didn't quite know where

455
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,370
to put this one so I just stuck it in

456
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,770
the middle here this is ultrasonic

457
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,689
ranging here this is super common or you

458
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,480
basically bounce a sound wave an

459
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,600
ultrasound ultrasonic sound wave offs

460
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,760
off a obstacle and the reflection the

461
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,649
time it takes to bounce back at you

462
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,940
tells you how far away it is and there's

463
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,740
a bunch of these out there they're not

464
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,780
expensive there's the imported ones

465
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,900
you've seen on the Left I've used this

466
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,060
thing done by Max bot X which the seem

467
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,350
to be a little bit better it's got a lot

468
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,600
of the calculations built into the

469
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:26,590
actual sensor so it gives you a distance

470
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,689
readout as an analog voltage and it also

471
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,610
has this nice thing called a sync pulse

472
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,500
so if you imagine having more than one

473
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,100
of these you can have a problem where

474
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,380
the receiver picks up pings from that

475
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,730
another transmitter transmitted and so

476
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,320
it gets a little confused so what you do

477
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,240
is just make them ping all at the same

478
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,389
time and the first one that comes back

479
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,330
is the one you sense so the max products

480
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,070
things have a sense I'm sorry a sync

481
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,659
input you can just hit them with the

482
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:59,080
GPIO s send them all at the same time

483
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,420
now getting into weird RF stuff which is

484
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,129
super cool especially I don't know that

485
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,060
much about it so it still seems a little

486
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,060
bit like magic on the left here there's

487
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,800
a good hackaday article about this

488
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,419
they're very inexpensive microwave

489
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,460
sensors and these are the sensors that

490
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,080
they have in supermarket doors so you

491
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,150
just walk up to it and it senses the

492
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,399
motion probably doing some kind of

493
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,090
Doppler or radar or something like that

494
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,850
opens opens the supermarket door on the

495
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,428
right is a radar you can build yourself

496
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,320
out of

497
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,240
he cans and this still seems like magic

498
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,178
even though this was kind of world war

499
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,309
two vintage technology you have a little

500
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,499
oscillator and you send it out and you

501
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,999
amplify the reflection and mix it back

502
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:42,919
and you can get the phase difference

503
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:44,539
which is the time delay which tells you

504
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,440
how far away whatever it was that

505
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,789
reflected that radio signal is here is

506
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,049
something called soli which is a

507
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:55,580
millimeter wave radar thing I haven't

508
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,649
used this I'm not even sure how real

509
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,799
this is but I like they're they're gifts

510
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:04,639
so I stole it for this once again fair

511
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,100
use and there's also if you actually

512
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:09,498
need to detect a hand gestures this is

513
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,480
called thing called leap motion which

514
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,759
works really well it just plugs in over

515
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,039
the USB and it kind of models your hand

516
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,379
as I understand so you can get a good

517
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,940
idea of where your fingers are okay

518
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:21,529
something that seems a little bit more

519
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,480
real than solely is this thing called

520
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,639
Walla BOTS which really exists I know

521
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,440
because I bought one and look at this

522
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,629
thing it's got like those three dipole

523
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,879
antennas there and it's got some that

524
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,129
curved thing up in the upper left is

525
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:38,990
some kind of a transmission line on the

526
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:41,779
PCB super super RF wizardry and this can

527
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,519
this can do a lot of things um they sell

528
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,830
it for stud finding I'm not sure that's

529
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,539
the right solution that this is a

530
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,850
solution for it in fact I'm not sure

531
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:52,519
what problem this is a solution for but

532
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,379
it's pretty cool once I got one of this

533
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,940
because I'm using it with an art project

534
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,129
with a friend of mine he's gonna make

535
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,139
artificial organs that I hope are gonna

536
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:02,629
this thing can detect when you're

537
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:05,149
inhaling and exhaling I want to make the

538
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:07,549
the artificial lungs breathe in sync

539
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,399
with your actual breath which is gonna

540
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:13,009
be cool and creepy if I can make it work

541
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:16,309
okay flex enforce so you've probably

542
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:19,220
seen these um these are kind of soft

543
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,749
circuits they're printed on captain or

544
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,090
something using some silkscreen

545
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:25,190
conductive ink that changes conductivity

546
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,928
when you bend it or you squeeze it or

547
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,460
something these are great these they're

548
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,279
cheap they're not particular accurate

549
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,899
but they're kind of useful I think these

550
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,080
were in the cyber gloves this is a

551
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:38,508
project I did with a friend of mine Cal

552
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,539
we needed a cyber glove to control this

553
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,549
crazy robe

554
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,619
thing that you were on your back it's

555
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,809
kind of a metaphor for addiction

556
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,908
couldn't find a cyber glove so we just

557
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,470
glued some of these Affleck's sensors to

558
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,299
some welding gloves and that was good

559
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,940
enough for the purposes of this kind of

560
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:57,210
punk rock art if you really want to

561
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,279
measure force and deflection the way to

562
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,100
do is is saying using a strain gauge and

563
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:05,840
this is you can get these that you can

564
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,189
just slap on two things the actual

565
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,709
signal conditioning for this is a little

566
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,019
tricky because the they are very linear

567
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,849
but the actual change in resistance when

568
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,710
you flex them is very small you put them

569
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,779
in a bridge configuration which gives

570
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,330
you a very small voltage difference so

571
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,989
you need a differential amplifier in the

572
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,728
old days the Omega or some industrial

573
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:29,070
equipment would happily sell you for six

574
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:31,229
hundred dollars a a bridge conditioner

575
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,309
like on the bottom right but these days

576
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:37,619
you can buy them far less expensively

577
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:41,489
sparkfun has a break out of this thing

578
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:44,789
called the x HX 711 which is a bridge

579
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:47,460
amplifier you put the very small signal

580
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:49,710
in and it amplifies it differentially

581
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,599
and you can buy these load cells for

582
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,099
just a couple bucks this is what's in

583
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,840
your bathroom scale they're pretty

584
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,279
accurate they're pretty linear they're

585
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,918
pretty good I think always thought it

586
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:03,119
would be fun to get a em get some sort

587
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,309
of a a floor tile and put one on every

588
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,019
corner and then it could tell what your

589
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,460
which direction you're leaning on or

590
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:13,590
something and use that as some kind of

591
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:15,419
an input for something moving on pizza

592
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,369
and vibration um how many people have

593
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,229
seen the little piezo disks like on the

594
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,059
top right yeah right these are super

595
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,950
cheap they're less than a dollar they're

596
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,220
probably only a couple cents if you buy

597
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,529
them in bulk a dirty secret is you can

598
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,200
plug that directly into an Arduino input

599
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,210
and when you hit the thing like with a

600
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,440
drum stick you can you can sense that

601
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,840
with the Arduino so you can turn

602
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,119
anything into a drum kit just by pasting

603
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,070
enough of these things on them and using

604
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,859
a MIDI say a MIDI library on your

605
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,580
Arduino I would put a protection diode

606
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,349
in there but don't let that stop you so

607
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,139
the principle of this thing is is just

608
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:53,580
this core

609
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,280
quartz crystal you squeeze the quartz on

610
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,960
missile lines the crystal boundaries and

611
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,490
you get a voltage often which you can

612
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,230
detect not much current but you get a

613
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,910
voltage and on the bottom right is a

614
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,980
vibration sensor using something similar

615
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,590
it's got a little weight that's kind of

616
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,530
resonant if you detects vibration that

617
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,899
that vibrates in resonance and it bends

618
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,290
the piezo electric substrate there which

619
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,090
you can then pick up let's go to

620
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,389
pressure sensors so I learned all about

621
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,980
this doing arm doing this surgical robot

622
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,780
where we're very interested in measuring

623
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,100
the pressure because of its high

624
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,690
pressure that removes the tissue you

625
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,969
want to make sure we're at the pressure

626
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,280
we think we are so there's basically

627
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,630
three flavors of pressure sensors is the

628
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,060
absolute where you have a sealed chamber

629
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,710
they all work by have something they all

630
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,290
work by having some kind of diagram

631
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,170
which deforms when it's got a pressure

632
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,540
differential with the absolute it's

633
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,200
either a vacuum or some reference

634
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,850
pressure the gage it's the reference

635
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,470
pressure is the atmosphere so this

636
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,820
measures the the pressure difference

637
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,110
when the with the atmosphere that's

638
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,000
useful if you're doing something like

639
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,790
you want to measure how much pressure of

640
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,710
your fan system is putting on yours your

641
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,330
server farm or something you want to

642
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,090
measure the difference from atmospheric

643
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,490
and finally a differential where

644
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,860
basically you have two two input ports

645
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,860
and you measure the pressure difference

646
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,389
between them so there's a whole bunch of

647
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,729
these things there's a bunch of MEMS

648
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:21,000
ones where the without where the

649
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:24,660
diaphragm is is made of micromachines

650
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,750
silicon and those are tiny and then

651
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,470
there's all kinds of other ones here's

652
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,630
the MEMS pressure sensor and Sparkfun

653
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,640
has a break out of this this is tiny

654
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,590
some of these things are so accurate

655
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,770
they can measure the difference in

656
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,899
pressure of like a 10 inch distance up

657
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,000
and down and to do that you basically

658
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,390
also have to measure the temperature so

659
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,700
most of these high high-precision MEMS

660
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,890
pressure sensor give you a temperature

661
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,280
measurement for free and that's kind of

662
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,210
nice to have sometimes

663
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,100
here's another kind of pressure

664
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,170
sensitive sensor which is a microphone

665
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,340
and this is a MEMS microphone there's

666
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,760
probably one in your

667
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,770
phone right now these are tiny these are

668
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,930
so small that the resonant frequencies

669
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,970
are higher than any audio frequency so

670
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,160
they tend to be amazingly flat frequency

671
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,820
response so these are great microphones

672
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,130
I hope somebody in the audio world makes

673
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,929
makes some things of this I think seed

674
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:27,550
studio has a has a kit with a bunch of

675
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,140
them around a circle and so you can do

676
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,270
beamforming you can make these

677
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:36,210
directional by combining the microphone

678
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:38,650
signals in the right way so flow one

679
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,660
there are a whole bunch of ways of

680
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,400
measuring liquid flow measuring gas flow

681
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,410
if you think you understand the Coriolis

682
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,420
effect check out the Coriolis mass flow

683
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,330
meter I won't get into it but it's super

684
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,640
cool physics going on and that you can

685
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,280
put a little turbine in the flow an easy

686
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,320
way is diagrammed on the top there where

687
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,879
basically you you just have a pipe and

688
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,139
you put some kind of constriction in

689
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,630
that pipe and you put a differential

690
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,300
pressure sensor across the two sections

691
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,950
and if you higher the flow the higher

692
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,139
the difference of the flow so is exactly

693
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,670
Ohm's law basically you have some

694
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,370
current you have some resistance and you

695
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:16,270
get some voltage differential from from

696
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:19,149
that Hall effect this is a cool side

697
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,700
effect of the charge carriers and

698
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,730
semiconductors you put a semiconductor

699
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,130
in a magnetic field and the charge the

700
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,440
charge carriers they they drift they

701
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,870
will move in the direction of the magnet

702
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,940
magnetic field from Lorentz force laws

703
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,979
on you remember physics right hand rule

704
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,140
all that but these are super great

705
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,230
they will detect a magnet so if you want

706
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,790
to have your magic box turn on something

707
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,800
when you open it you just glue a magnet

708
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,270
to the lid and you use one of these Hall

709
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,230
effect sensors I think this is an

710
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,820
Allegro one the a 31:44 and that's super

711
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,590
easy and it just gives you a digital

712
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,169
output goes right into an Arduino or

713
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,899
something you can also use it to detect

714
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,780
rotation you can use it to detect your

715
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,480
teeth coming by this the thing on the

716
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,889
left is kind of how a hammond organ

717
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
works you basically have these tone

718
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,750
wheels and a guitar pickup has the

719
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,810
wheels turn they change the magnetic

720
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,180
relativity and so you can see

721
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:19,450
when each teeth when each tooth goes by

722
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,610
the sensor you can also detect angle and

723
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,980
this is nice because sometimes you don't

724
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,780
want to bolt something to the shaft of

725
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,520
whatever is moving you can do this kind

726
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,950
of non-contact you just put this at the

727
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,629
end or outside the wheel that you want

728
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,980
to turn and this is great because it

729
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,520
doesn't even have to be perfectly

730
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,190
aligned you can also detect current this

731
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,930
is great for a number of things if you

732
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,220
want to do a really cheap robotic system

733
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,620
and you don't want a limit switch

734
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,030
sometimes you just run it into a hard

735
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,080
stop and you look at the current when

736
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:51,250
that currents too high you've hit the

737
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,710
heart stop boom easy so talk a little

738
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,480
bit about accelerometers and gyros um

739
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,350
anybody played with this these are super

740
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,760
fun

741
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:03,219
yeah lots of breakouts there's many

742
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,950
different flavors they come in different

743
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,840
forest ranges and things like that one

744
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,210
thing I'd like to draw your attention to

745
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,550
is how cool they are inside and they're

746
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,040
so tiny you never see these but um these

747
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,680
are tiny little micro machine machines

748
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,860
and the one on the photo micrograph on

749
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,960
the left is a is a accelerometer this is

750
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,750
a to access thing you can see the little

751
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,790
Springs and this is a plate that moves

752
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,520
from side to side and the one on the

753
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,550
right is a gyroscope that's part of a

754
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:37,060
disc which is rotates basically it's on

755
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,250
being stimulated to to rotate in a

756
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,340
torsional oscillation and you can see

757
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:46,480
the the inter digitated electrodes which

758
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:48,730
it which will cause that to to rotate

759
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,190
using a electric field and then you can

760
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:54,580
pick up where it is using capacitive

761
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,820
sensing if you want to play with one of

762
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,429
these accelerometers you can get a Wii

763
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,590
Nunchuk for not much money and there are

764
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,840
instructions online how to hook this up

765
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,340
straight to an Arduino and you can wave

766
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,909
things around and make lightsabers and

767
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,000
stuff like that super easy and if you

768
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:15,370
want to put everything together if

769
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,020
you're doing navigation or robots or a

770
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,979
drone or something like that there's

771
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:23,040
something called an IMU

772
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:26,070
which is inertial measurement use a unit

773
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,930
and this particular one has a gyro tells

774
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,860
you which direction you're pointing and

775
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,410
accelerometer

776
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,479
tells you how fast you're going or the

777
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,040
accelerations a three-d magnetometer

778
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,610
which is basically a compass tells you

779
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,450
what what direction you're pointing in

780
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,300
respect to the Earth's magnetic field

781
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,710
and it's got a 2d in klonoa which tells

782
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,090
you your tilt and things like that and

783
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,680
then it puts it all together for you

784
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,240
because otherwise it's complicated you

785
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,120
have to use Kalman filters and stuff

786
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,330
like that this thing does it for you

787
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,600
super cool fire hose slightly different

788
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,939
direction gas sensors ok turns out you

789
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,010
might have seen these uh sensors that

790
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,900
can detect basically any kind of

791
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,629
combustible gas any kind of gas that

792
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,630
reacts with oxygen the way it does that

793
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:12,480
is some surface chemistry of tin on tin

794
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:16,020
tin dioxide you hit it with a heater and

795
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,320
and it changes the resistance and you

796
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,629
can you can use that to figure out how

797
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,260
much of a particular gas is in the

798
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,210
concentration this can be very sensitive

799
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,790
this is the same thing used in very

800
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,920
expensive gas detectors but those have

801
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,810
been very expensively calibrated and

802
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
tweaked and things like this if you just

803
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,429
buy something like this

804
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,620
look you buy something like this from

805
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:43,290
seed studio this is ten dollars or

806
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,909
something it's Oh needs a little bit

807
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:49,730
more work to be accurate but you can

808
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:54,720
detect you can detect things like

809
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:55,770
volatile organic compounds I don't think

810
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,540
it's gonna be possible to do a

811
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,650
breathalyzer badge but if you figure out

812
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:04,800
how to do it I would like to know all

813
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,290
right final couple gas sensor these are

814
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,240
humidity sensors and the capacitors with

815
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:12,090
some kind of dielectric that swells and

816
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,310
shrinks with the relative humidity and

817
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,990
there was a really nice project

818
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,120
I liked here this is a wearable badge

819
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,160
where the humidity sensor on it and also

820
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,600
buttons you can you can when you press

821
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,190
it you can say this is comfortable this

822
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,110
is do cold this is too hot and

823
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,290
apparently this all goes back to some

824
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,360
smart control that will hopefully adjust

825
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,840
the AC so that people are comfortable

826
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,659
and this turns out to be

827
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,959
big deal apparently the thermostats and

828
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,300
a lot of places are set for big men who

829
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,290
may be comfortable at lower temperatures

830
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,940
than smaller people and women so I'd

831
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:49,870
like to think about this as some kind of

832
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:52,930
equalizing feedback to get these um to

833
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:55,389
get it comfortable for everybody all

834
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:58,960
right last couple slides here going

835
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,490
pretty fast so you want to measure

836
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,820
temperature there's a number of ways to

837
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,260
do it a pretty classic one is this

838
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,460
thermocouple where you just have two

839
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,900
different metals and you put them

840
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,420
together you get a slight voltage which

841
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,040
depends on temperature one thing I'd

842
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,800
like to draw you draw your attention to

843
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,440
are these industrial temperature

844
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,419
controllers which are kind of amazingly

845
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,520
and amazingly inexpensive this one is

846
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:25,960
like $30 and this is what they use in

847
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,920
factories for process control you need

848
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,810
to keep something in a certain

849
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:34,360
temperature this has a thermometer this

850
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:37,149
this a thermocouple that's in the bottom

851
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,530
there and it's got this controller which

852
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,570
tells you what the temperature is and

853
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,190
also a set temperature you set it to a

854
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,379
temperature and this thing also gives

855
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,420
you a relay which will turn things on

856
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,160
and off like coolers or ovens or

857
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,780
something like this so you don't even in

858
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,490
your microcontroller it does all the

859
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,230
feedback for you it figures out the

860
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,480
response characteristics of your system

861
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,730
if you've got the world's junk iasts

862
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,460
toaster oven you can put one of these on

863
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,930
your toaster oven and make the world's

864
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,850
best toaster oven and some of the more

865
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,590
expensive ones have serial input output

866
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,159
you can log this stuff if you want to

867
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,380
make your own reflow oven for surface

868
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,029
mount soldering or your own a hot plate

869
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,120
you can do that kind of surprisingly

870
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,970
inexpensively and with surprisingly good

871
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,980
temperature characteristics

872
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,330
it'll also thermistors you put these in

873
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,820
the battery pack when you take apart

874
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:27,250
your lithium battery there's probably

875
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,050
one in there as a thermal sensor if you

876
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,250
overcharge your batteries they're going

877
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,250
to blow up you don't want to do that

878
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:39,130
super cheap super easy there's also this

879
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,310
thing called a Dallas semiconductor one

880
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,930
8s 20 which has a digital output you

881
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,869
don't even have to worry about any

882
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,638
analog noise or anything

883
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,260
there's a couple libraries for the

884
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,940
Arduino hooks up right to the Arduino

885
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,220
you can put a couple of them in series

886
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,460
they put these things in motherboards

887
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,750
and server farms to detect over

888
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,050
temperature or under temperature

889
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,700
conditions around different parts of the

890
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,520
system but you can use them for whatever

891
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,250
you want to you want want a digital

892
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,900
thermometer for any reason at all this

893
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,109
one's kind of interesting I think they

894
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:17,099
discontinued this this is a um this is a

895
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:18,598
a non-contact infrared temperature

896
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,099
sensing device I think they finally

897
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,920
discontinued this because no one could

898
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,290
figure out how to calibrate it

899
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,960
accurately but basically this uses on

900
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,890
middle infrared waves and gives you

901
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,690
non-contact

902
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,330
temperature measurement I guess the idea

903
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,800
this was this you put it in your the

904
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,390
casing of your smartphone and when your

905
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,000
smartphone is getting too hot then you

906
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:43,740
throttle down the the computation or

907
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,030
your transmission stuff and kind of

908
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,729
finishing up with this thing called a

909
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:51,869
thermo-pile and this also used mid

910
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,730
ranges infrared and you've seen these in

911
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:55,830
all the motion sensors know Tom Cruise

912
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,060
has to move really slowly so it doesn't

913
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,119
pick him up when he's high stting the

914
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,160
drools or something like that these work

915
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,560
kind of interesting these need that

916
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,000
weird kind of plastic lens which is

917
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,430
height high-density polyethylene works

918
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,660
as a lens to kind of separate the field

919
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,080
of view of this thing because this thing

920
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,629
works on changes so as you cross the

921
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,580
field of view it basically has at least

922
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,339
two sensors sometimes there four of them

923
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:26,359
in a quadrant as you cross the field of

924
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:28,920
view you get this characteristic high

925
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:32,940
high beam low beam thing which you can

926
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,920
detect motion without any kind of

927
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,330
outward sensor this is just picking up

928
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:43,460
the heat and this is my last slide this

929
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,460
is there's an interesting use of the

930
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,050
infrared sensors because if you look at

931
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,970
the sky the sky is cold and infrared and

932
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,109
though the earth is warm and infrared

933
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,450
and so he can use this in a feedback

934
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:57,029
loop to keep your drone stable by trying

935
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,290
to keep not too much sky and not too

936
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,120
much

937
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,009
earth so you keep it right on the

938
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,710
horizon then you know your level or at

939
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:07,280
least compared to the horizon all right

940
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:10,220
so I am kind of running out of slides

941
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,340
running out of time got time for some

942
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:16,730
questions and a bunch of resources all

943
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:19,060
that all these slides are on my blog any

944
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:29,170
questions thank you

945
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:29,170
[Applause]

946
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,340
all right it's been a long conference

947
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,110
thanks for making it through all right

948
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,820
do you have any favorite input

949
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:45,300
multiplexers you have lots of sensors

950
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,710
but only use them all at once oh yeah

951
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,900
what depends what kind of sensor I think

952
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,560
there is a chip which you can hook up

953
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,180
multiple I squared C 2 and I think

954
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,400
adafruit's got a breakout I forget the

955
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,250
name of it but you can if you have like

956
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,780
a bunch of those any I squared C has a

957
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,030
particular address if you need to hook

958
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,010
up more than one you can put it on this

959
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,440
multiplexer chip and I'm sorry I just

960
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,760
forgetting the name of the chip but I

961
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,850
think you that's got an eight-way

962
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,260
breakout you just hit it at its address

963
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,120
with the address of the one you talk to

964
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,920
and then you can talk to any one of the

965
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,509
eight on the same address that are just

966
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,250
hanging off the other end of that is

967
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,590
that next for the question or yeah and

968
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,960
for analyte stuff analog stuff um

969
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:30,120
there's these CMOS switches they have

970
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,670
like 16 input or 16 output 1 input those

971
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,430
work pretty well once again I'm sorry I

972
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,670
forget the actual part number of that

973
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:41,940
but look for CMOS analog switch that's a

974
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:45,300
good way to multiplex analog signals and

975
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:49,740
most microcontrollers will have quite a

976
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,820
few analog inputs to using the same kind

977
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:57,390
of mechanism they just have a little

978
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:58,530
multiplexer on the input thanks how do

979
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,450
you quick question so you showed a

980
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,060
hardware PID controller do you have any

981
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,529
favorite software PID libraries oh you

982
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,299
know what I don't either

983
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,740
I mean I'm old-school enough that the

984
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,810
last time I did that I wrote it myself

985
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,910
which was probably a mistake if you know

986
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,890
of any great ones I'd love to hear about

987
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,779
it and then just generally if anybody if

988
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,430
I forgotten your favorite sensor let me

989
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,810
know about it I collect these things and

990
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,200
I don't want to miss anything cool so

991
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:24,360
thank you thank you sure if there's

992
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,770
Dallas semiconductor temperature sensors

993
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,420
are great I have like dozens of them

994
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,450
scattered around the house especially

995
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,010
interesting the instrument like the HVAC

996
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,080
and look at the delta T through the

997
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,970
system I did find out one interesting

998
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,190
aspect of them though is their specs for

999
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,720
what the maximum temperature is but not

1000
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,030
actually what temperature gradient

1001
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,669
though handles so I had one on the

1002
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,250
Loup in and out of the exchanger and I

1003
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,910
had like three of them fail

1004
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,910
coincidentally and I think just the

1005
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,980
rapid temperature change when it became

1006
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,720
really cold really fast I ended up

1007
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,490
fracturing something re right that

1008
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,330
sounds right yes sir how cold was that

1009
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,890
just just out of curiosity it wasn't

1010
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,200
particularly cold it just went from

1011
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,390
right it's cycled yeah so yeah thermal

1012
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,609
cycling the epoxy cracks yeah yeah good

1013
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:12,220
times

1014
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:14,140
hi first thanks for coming I think you

1015
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,189
really appreciate it Tom I have a

1016
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,870
question about a sensor that you

1017
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,540
mentioned briefly the microwave sensors

1018
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,980
yes sir

1019
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,380
have you seen them in practice much

1020
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:27,850
using detection of objects like in

1021
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:30,190
public places airports or transit areas

1022
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:34,089
just to have an idea of what someone

1023
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:36,790
might have on them no I haven't I'm not

1024
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,340
sure at least the one the the wall about

1025
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,840
I played with I'm not sure it's I would

1026
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,220
I would not use that for a

1027
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,710
mission-critical detection because it's

1028
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,810
in it looks like a work in progress but

1029
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,520
I'm sure there might be stuff out there

1030
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:57,400
that's considerably more sophisticated I

1031
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:02,290
don't know about it if anybody does all

1032
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:04,660
right yeah sure thank you yeah hi I'm we

1033
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,890
do mentoring with junior high kids and

1034
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,890
they bring all the little brothers and

1035
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,180
sisters along I like to just throw

1036
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,160
everything out it I'm gonna let them

1037
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,750
play around with it but you have any

1038
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,049
recommendations if you just hit the web

1039
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,670
and look around for educational yeah you

1040
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,530
know a great thing to start with is

1041
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,240
Mitch Altman has some wonderful little

1042
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,590
kits there's a little retroreflector

1043
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,479
thing you wave your hand over and the

1044
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:28,540
color changes it's like magic it's great

1045
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:33,580
and it's small and it's a great starter

1046
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:37,120
soldering kit find Mitch if he yep

1047
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,950
alright that's a perfect thing that's

1048
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,690
Mitch yeah yeah yeah he's got some great

1049
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,540
educational stuff and he's got a lot of

1050
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:47,010
the experience with the younger set so

1051
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,009
he's a great resource for that

1052
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:55,080
all right I think ending a little bit

1053
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,080
early probably not a bad thing it's been

1054
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:07,610
a long conference thanks for coming out

1055
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:07,610
[Applause]
