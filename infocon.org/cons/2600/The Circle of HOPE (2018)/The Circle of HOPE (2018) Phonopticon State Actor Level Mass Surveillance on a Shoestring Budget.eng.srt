1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,939
good evening and welcome to what I now

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,599
realize is part two of all things

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,250
surveillance I thought that talked

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,490
before by simply mathematics was pretty

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,930
great oh and thank you for exacerbating

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,270
my paranoia my name is Mark Milhouse I

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,279
am online

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm amnesiac I started out as a 26:51

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,099
special intelligence systems

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,660
communicator administrator in the United

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,610
States Marine Corps if that sounds like

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,290
a mouthful yes it was and my drill

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,250
instructors made me say it over and over

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:44,219
again I'm also a cyclist and most

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,800
prominently I am a computer forensics

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,480
investigator at a consumer class action

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,940
law firm just like you said edelson pc

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:58,709
where we investigate companies for

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,959
various things so I'm gonna start out

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,660
with the question is anyone here from an

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,739
advertising company I really didn't

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,420
expect any of you to raise your hands

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,030
but thank you also I might work at a law

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,890
firm but I'm not an attorney I'm not

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,799
here to give advice or opinion from a

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,259
legal perspective it's I'm just a

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,610
technical guy so bottom line up front

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,240
what I want you to walk away with

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,909
tonight from this talk is that as a

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,460
digital society we've built ourselves

31
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,619
into an open ecosystem of bidding on ad

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,439
placements based on geolocation and

33
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,350
other sensitive information the more

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,970
personal information publishers provide

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,408
to advertisers the higher the bids

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,820
they'll receive for their placements and

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,040
they know this this could be used for

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,020
surveillance and I'm going to show you a

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,180
how a system that takes advantage of

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,979
that and abuses this information

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,979
disclosure might be designed and then I

42
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,869
want to discuss a few things that we can

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,750
do to fix this and I hope that maybe we

44
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,750
can take that conversation forward past

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,330
this talk so if this wasn't the talk you

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,260
wanted you're free to go hit up the toll

47
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,120
variety hour and

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,010
work on your elite hacks or skills so

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,689
I'm sure there are a few of you who are

50
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,790
wondering why the title of this talk is

51
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,480
fun Opticon I figured I'd explain it

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,409
really briefly

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,890
it's a portmanteau of the word

54
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,390
panopticon and phones a panopticon is

55
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,409
just a prison structure where all the

56
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,899
inmates are observed simultaneously and

57
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:42,390
if this structure here on the right

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,769
looks familiar to you guys there's a

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,839
pretty good reason for that

60
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,840
and I figured I'd take an opportunity to

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,010
the guards were security bands to

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,810
control their insults leave it to me all

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,760
the wall back there is a barn Knicks

64
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,920
battery once the battery is removed

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,629
everything is gonna slam it emergency

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,929
monitor so you definitely need to get

67
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,929
that

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,370
well we could just get it first to the

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,369
provider

70
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:29,010
yeah yeah that freeze-frame was

71
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:32,459
deliberate so fuzzy computer animations

72
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,019
aside at my job our goals our

73
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,480
investigative goals we're looking for

74
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,640
issues with privacy security compliance

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,140
fraud anything else that we think might

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,089
be interesting so in order to do that we

77
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,958
test a lot of apps and websites and

78
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,720
products I'm going to focus on apps

79
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,909
today mostly because those tend to have

80
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,920
the most interesting information have

81
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:59,849
access to a lot of different sensors

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,409
that computers might not and for the

83
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,810
purpose of this talk we're gonna look

84
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,149
more specifically at analyzing web

85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,310
traffic and specifically in per suite

86
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,659
but generally some basic tools that we

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,700
might use when we're doing this

88
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,840
if you're curious on how this works you

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,199
want to go try it out later

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,899
burp suite and Wireshark we do compile

91
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,970
source code with tools like jot X for

92
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,710
instance and if you're interested in

93
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,419
finding out what's being stored locally

94
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,849
on your phone it's pretty easy to find

95
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,830
some sequel Lite databases that you can

96
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:32,760
open up with something like sequel Lite

97
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,389
browser if you're in burp suite you

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,880
might see something like this so this is

99
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,039
a request that's being sent to an

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,630
advertising network and this would be a

101
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,840
request that's going to pull down the

102
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,210
advertisement for you it's called a bid

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,330
request and in the bid request you can

104
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,669
see that there's some pretty specific

105
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,680
information there there's a really

106
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,409
high-resolution

107
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:02,250
geo coordinates it tells you the carrier

108
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:04,770
and it's blacked out but in there is

109
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,030
also the name of the app and sometimes

110
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,030
even the name of the page that you're on

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,820
so this is a simplified overview of the

112
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,940
bidding process your phone would send a

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,130
bid request along with the info and then

114
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,810
the advertiser would return to your

115
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,450
phone the URI of the ad picks or the ad

116
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,130
itself the content and then the tracking

117
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,250
the tracking pixel would be filled with

118
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,590
with macros that your phone would then

119
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,900
or the ad networks would then fill in

120
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,250
with the specific information so then

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,130
when your phone went to request that

122
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,639
tracking pixel from whoever your

123
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,469
advertisers analytics company is that

124
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:54,540
tracking pixel request would have the

125
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:57,450
macro filled so when I saw the responses

126
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,510
that had the JavaScript code I thought

127
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,130
to myself well what if we could just

128
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,389
inject our own JavaScript in there and

129
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,669
see what happens because I was curious

130
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,780
like the containers that these ads are

131
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,380
being displayed and how do they behave

132
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,020
and those containers specifically are

133
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,729
they're called web views and web views

134
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,370
are pretty interesting they render HTML

135
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,740
CSS and JavaScript and sometimes they

136
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,229
can even access flash or Java they do

137
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,840
this inside an Android app so that the

138
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,370
app developer can render this type of

139
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,200
code where they normally wouldn't be

140
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,240
able to and this can be dangerous

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,010
because it might mean that an

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,700
advertisement has access to parts of the

143
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,729
operating system that they wouldn't

144
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,330
normally parts of the operating system

145
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,740
that they only have access to because

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,289
the app has requested it and those

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,020
permissions are inherent inherited for

148
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:52,440
instance not all ads need access to your

149
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,969
geolocation but a lot of times your

150
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,130
weather app has requested that

151
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,900
permission and so then every ad that's

152
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,310
displayed in your weather app would then

153
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,000
be able to access your geolocation as

154
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:06,060
well this is something that's commonly

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,620
leveraged in malvert izing I'm sure most

156
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,330
of you are familiar with malvert izing

157
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,760
but we come across another portmanteau

158
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,530
it's malicious advertising and is

159
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,310
exploiting loopholes and how ads are

160
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,020
displayed to gain unauthorized access

161
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,090
the most common one that we're probably

162
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,979
all familiar with is drive-by downloads

163
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,989
but that's not all there are a lot and

164
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,520
there are a lot of easier ones than

165
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,979
drive-by downloads so the low-hanging

166
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,039
fruit be stuff that you can access just

167
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,840
kind of natively within the browser you

168
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,390
might be able to get the name of the app

169
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,179
the battery level you might be able to

170
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,080
trigger the vibrate function and get

171
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,300
connection data

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
and some of these things are really

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,729
commonly used in device fingerprinting

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,409
which is going to be important later but

175
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:50,639
then you can also get location like I

176
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,349
mentioned before and if you haven't

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,009
noticed this talk is pretty much going

178
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,628
to be mostly about location so how to

179
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,139
get the geolocation JavaScript is pretty

180
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:03,150
easy this is actually kind of a mixed up

181
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,110
version of what you'd find if you just

182
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,210
Google JavaScript geolocation requests

183
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,710
but in this what I did was I switched

184
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,479
out actually getting the location for

185
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,609
just getting true/false or none

186
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,229
depending on whether that function was

187
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,909
successful or not the reason I did that

188
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,979
was because I wanted to run these ads

189
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,440
myself and see what I would be able to

190
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,150
access so I found a cheap Russian ad

191
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,620
platform that I didn't have to pay very

192
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,469
much for and would allow me to pull

193
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,219
whatever code I wanted into the ads and

194
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:38,309
I bought some ads and it got rejected

195
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:40,500
and it turns out that they don't like it

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,419
whenever you go and get the ad approved

197
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,690
and then you start sneaking in new

198
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,180
JavaScript I was doing this swapping out

199
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,320
the code to kind of test because I'm the

200
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,599
kind of person that likes the test on

201
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,160
the fly and I was doing a lot of like

202
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,020
you know debugging while the ads were

203
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,719
displaying but of course they finger

204
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,829
print the ads and then whenever they go

205
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,620
and check that the finger prints not the

206
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,880
same it raises a red flag and they tell

207
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,850
you that you can't advertise on their

208
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,399
platform anymore so I realized that

209
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,230
would be important to pass QA checks we

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,820
needed legit looking ads they needed to

211
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,070
be believable they also needed to be

212
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,230
boring because I really didn't want

213
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:21,690
anyone clicking on them because clicks

214
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:23,550
are expensive we needed a legit looking

215
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,990
landing page because as it turns out

216
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,180
they actually do click on it whether you

217
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,260
like it or not so you needed some

218
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,569
content on there and maybe just make it

219
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,760
HTTPS because that's kind of easy to do

220
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,579
you don't have to really do too much and

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,560
it makes it look really legit and then

222
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:43,229
don't do stupid stuff so like swapping

223
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,729
out code during redirects a couple

224
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,660
things that will easily get you booted

225
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,250
off of an app network so this is what

226
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,740
the first ad looked like is kind of

227
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,370
reminiscent of the 1990s

228
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,040
I decided that I would give it a

229
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:05,700
redesign and I think you guys can tell

230
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,079
where my inspiration was and I have a

231
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,770
feeling that some of you in this room

232
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,560
may have seen some of these ads before

233
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:16,589
and I'll explain why that is later as

234
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,390
well but this is the landing page and if

235
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,520
you're wondering was the countdown timer

236
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,680
for don't worry the resets every time

237
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,449
you reload the page so now you're

238
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,930
wondering okay did he get the ads to run

239
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,589
and yes I did I actually got it to run

240
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,209
on almost a hundred thousand phones oh

241
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:39,029
man I got about a thousand clicks out of

242
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:41,510
it which was pretty surprising since my

243
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,490
advertisers were completely nonsensical

244
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,770
and I only spent $40 which I thought was

245
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,420
pretty awesome it means that you get to

246
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,470
test your code a lot for like no money

247
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,589
so what did we learn from this we

248
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,810
learned the ads are cheap we learned

249
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,329
that by passing quality control isn't

250
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,500
nothing but it's also still pretty

251
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:07,500
trivial we learned that GPS access isn't

252
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,940
guaranteed and and one thing that I

253
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,920
didn't point out before about the

254
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,260
Russian ad network that I was using was

255
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,750
even though it showed up on a hundred

256
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,220
thousand phones the information that I

257
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,800
was getting was really inconsistent and

258
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,250
I was having a lot of trouble with the

259
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,930
JavaScript itself I'm sure all of you

260
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,529
could probably debug into a better much

261
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,239
better job than I did but one conclusion

262
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,740
that I came to was based on the data

263
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
that I was getting back on how

264
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,010
inconsistent it was I'm pretty sure that

265
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,110
the network that I was using and I'm not

266
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,569
going to name them was using a lot of

267
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,740
fraudulent traffic which is something

268
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,140
that's kind of rampant in the ad

269
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,880
industry so I asked myself the question

270
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,020
would it be possible for an attacker to

271
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,270
actually build a surveillance system

272
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:56,130
that uses mobile advertisements to track

273
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:57,630
user location and in order to do this

274
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,420
would need a handful of things would

275
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,040
need to be able to deliver ads and in

276
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,839
order to deliver ads you need a

277
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,010
demand-side platform it's pretty

278
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
straightforward it's just like the

279
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,459
Russian one but I don't

280
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,980
waste my money anymore so let's get a

281
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,329
more legit one you need to be able to

282
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,010
programmatically interact with that

283
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,050
demand side platform and just about

284
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,450
every single one of them has an API so

285
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,490
that's covered you need to be able to

286
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,050
identify a target uniquely and this is

287
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,610
kind of natively built into these

288
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,979
systems and advertising ID but now we

289
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,420
have a handful of new problems to solve

290
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,820
we need to be able to get the

291
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,370
geolocation I think all of you already

292
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,950
know the answer to that question and we

293
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,610
need to be able to resolve a target to a

294
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,920
person and verify a person's identity so

295
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,570
for solving the first problem one of my

296
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,860
co-workers came to me one day because

297
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,520
they knew the project that I was working

298
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,649
on and they brought me this article it

299
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,660
takes just a thousand dollars to track

300
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,610
someone's location with mobile ads and I

301
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,350
spent $40 and already done it and I

302
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,060
thought to myself oh no I'd been scooped

303
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,709
but after reading into it I found that

304
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,430
they had a pretty novel approach to it

305
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:10,260
they use good base surveillance they

306
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,680
bought targeted ads against different

307
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,529
locations to a specific ad ID and then

308
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,599
if those ads displayed then they would

309
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,540
know depending on which ad it was that

310
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,339
displayed they would know where the

311
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,120
person was kind of roughly so it looked

312
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,700
something like this

313
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:36,450
and this is an excerpt from there the

314
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:38,459
paper from these Washington State so I

315
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,190
thought to myself that's cool but nobody

316
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,689
wants to spend a thousand dollars and an

317
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,520
attacker really wouldn't want to have to

318
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,450
build this kind of complicated system

319
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,209
right but the thing that we all kind of

320
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,100
know already you can just grab

321
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:55,290
somebody's location so that well the

322
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,270
grid based system was novel there might

323
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,920
be a little bit faster ways to do it we

324
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,040
could use JavaScript like I tried before

325
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,630
but that can be inconsistent sometimes

326
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,819
you can use em raid which is kind of a

327
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,040
at industry abstraction of different

328
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,760
JavaScript functions and you can use

329
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,209
tracking pixels which obviously tracking

330
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,380
pixels make the most sense so for those

331
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,329
of you that aren't familiar with how

332
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,860
tracking pixels work like I mentioned

333
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,339
before there are these macros

334
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,649
in the URL and it tells your phone to go

335
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,490
ahead and retrieve the pixel that's at

336
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:31,230
that location when the user requests the

337
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,800
ad the tracking pixel request is also

338
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,209
transmitted and the user receives or the

339
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,279
advertiser receives that request and

340
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,119
then can store that information for

341
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,600
different purposes

342
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,250
a lot of sites have more than just

343
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,180
latitude and longitude like I discussed

344
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,200
before they might have the app name or

345
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,380
the name of the page that you're

346
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,730
visiting they might have more specific

347
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,779
information about your phone for

348
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,750
instance things that could be used for

349
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,820
fingerprinting and it doesn't require

350
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,850
the target to click on the ad which is

351
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,029
kind of critical because if it required

352
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,050
the targets it to click on the ad then

353
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,029
you wouldn't be able to really

354
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,660
consistently get these the geolocation

355
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,610
coordinates that you want as long as the

356
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,170
ad is displayed then the attacker gets

357
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,149
the data that they requested so I don't

358
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,439
want to bore you with a bunch of

359
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,730
pictures of geo locations that people

360
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,829
may or may not have realized that they

361
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,690
were giving up while I ramble on

362
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:34,140
endlessly about how this can be used to

363
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:42,959
identify people their home their

364
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:44,370
routines and I'm not going to dwell on

365
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,109
the fact that this information can be

366
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,089
used to identify the vulnerable groups

367
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,660
of people who they are how they

368
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:54,029
communicate and where they live but at

369
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,880
least now we know how to consistently

370
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,439
get to your locations so the next

371
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,529
question is how do you resolve a target

372
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,720
to a specific person so when you have

373
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,640
the geo locations who exactly are these

374
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,620
people and I stumbled across an article

375
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,300
that is called unique in the crowd the

376
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,209
privacy bounds of human mobility and

377
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,459
these researchers studied a million and

378
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,699
a half people and believe it was in

379
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:24,079
Europe over the course of 15 months they

380
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,959
were using cell tower resolution and

381
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,239
roughly the range of an hour to know

382
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,579
somebody was in this location

383
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
within that range of time and they found

384
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,160
that

385
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,829
four data points with that resolution

386
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:43,259
could yield about 95% accuracy they said

387
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:46,559
in their paper that even course datasets

388
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,179
provide very little anonymity that means

389
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,350
that if an attacker knows where you are

390
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:54,720
at a certain time four times then they

391
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,360
can know with a 95% certainty that that

392
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,990
person is most certainly you and no one

393
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,600
else so we have the answer to that

394
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,000
question now we need to be able to

395
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,649
verify somebody's identity and this was

396
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,329
one that actually I had written the

397
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:10,438
entire talk and I was having a

398
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,619
conversation with one of my co-workers

399
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,110
about it and he pointed this out to me

400
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,688
he said what about device fingerprinting

401
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,938
and so we came up with this scheme where

402
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:23,189
you could send somebody the URL for a

403
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,020
page that in the background it would

404
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,399
fingerprint their device so if you

405
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,319
already know the phone number for your

406
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:30,899
target or maybe their email address or

407
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,350
something like that it's probably sticks

408
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:36,658
so it's not 100% accurate but it's good

409
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,090
for helping eliminate mismatches and

410
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,980
maybe if you interacted with your target

411
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,809
a few times you might be able to build a

412
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,299
profile of the different devices maybe

413
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:48,120
the different browsers they're using so

414
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,600
that you can be able to weed out things

415
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,090
that definitely are not them

416
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,070
so one of my co-workers and I pulled out

417
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,020
our phones held them up next to each

418
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,950
other and went to this page and it

419
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,129
actually turned out with the same

420
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:08,909
fingerprint so it's not perfect but it's

421
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:10,500
useful so we have that we can use device

422
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:12,419
fingerprinting to verify somebody's

423
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,950
identity but you're wondering when you

424
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,590
put all this together how exactly does

425
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:21,299
it work we would list all known

426
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:23,070
locations for a target would then we

427
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,100
would know where your house is your work

428
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,720
maybe your dry cleaner or wearing to go

429
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,279
to church we were then sent

430
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,580
advertisements to everyone that visits

431
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,799
these locations an attacker would add

432
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,320
all the suspects to a list list and

433
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,679
target them specifically so a suspect

434
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:45,960
would be somebody who has been to enough

435
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:48,240
of these locations to possibly be you or

436
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,070
be the target

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,590
so then the ads could take device

438
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,300
fingerprints or you could send them to

439
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,610
pages to take device fingerprints and

440
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,899
the attacker could use like I said

441
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,790
before targeted link and it's not

442
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,970
malware so the device would obviously

443
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:09,639
let it run and potential matches could

444
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,110
be made that way eventually they an

445
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,330
attacker would be able to narrow it down

446
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,939
to just one person based on movements

447
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,980
when the target is away from home or out

448
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,430
of town or correlate it with social

449
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,560
media posts to verify the identity and

450
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,640
finally they can use this once they have

451
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,990
this and they know that this is

452
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,750
certainly you they can use your

453
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,450
advertising ID to follow their target it

454
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,000
indefinitely because even though the ad

455
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,490
IDs are changeable and they're supposed

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,810
to be pseudo anonymous people rarely

457
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,210
even know that that's an option to

458
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,800
change your ad ID and so it sticks for

459
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,210
quite a while so I'm going to show you

460
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:55,840
roughly what something like this might

461
00:19:46,210 --> 00:20:06,280
look like so this was built in leaflet

462
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:07,540
with a Python flask backend so you guys

463
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,460
might not know this about me but I

464
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:17,440
actually live in Wrigley Field so we're

465
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,760
going to put marks house here and I'm

466
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,890
certain that I live within Wrigley Field

467
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,990
so we'll say 200 meters right that's

468
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:32,020
about the resolution we need and I'm

469
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:35,580
home from 5:00 p.m. to 9 o'clock in the

470
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,580
morning because I teleport to work

471
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:55,510
and a little bit of research shows that

472
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:57,470
I work in Merchandise Mart so max work I

473
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,670
was told that if I didn't put the

474
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:03,170
apostrophes in there I was gonna be in

475
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:05,000
trouble now Marina smart is pretty big

476
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:09,020
so we're gonna give it a 400 meter

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,340
radius just to be sure and like I said a

478
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:15,620
teleport to work so five o'clock I'm

479
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:24,709
saying this backwards nine o'clock in

480
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:29,300
the morning and I get off at 5:00 all

481
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:31,550
right so now we know we have two points

482
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I figured I wouldn't drag you through

483
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:37,580
creating four of those and I'm gonna go

484
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:42,800
ahead and commit that and look at that

485
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:45,530
now not only do we know where I live and

486
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:49,040
where I work two things that we already

487
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:51,830
knew but by following that advertising

488
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,760
ID with these advertisements that I

489
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:59,600
already ran you can see I spent some

490
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:07,850
time in Lincoln Park Zoo and down here

491
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:09,889
it's me hanging out of the beach so this

492
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,969
can also be used for other purposes as

493
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:16,400
well you can kind of if you were running

494
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,030
advertisements more generally you might

495
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
be able to just browse see if there's

496
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:26,840
anything interesting going on you know

497
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,000
who's where who's using what but there's

498
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,740
also kind of a more nefarious use for it

499
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,610
as well which is if you have an app that

500
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,350
you think is let's say these people

501
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,389
using this photo editor we want to

502
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,320
target them for some specific reason now

503
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,100
I know where all of them are when

504
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,610
they're using this app and an attacker

505
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,889
would be able to go in here and just say

506
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,860
this person's here frequently that's

507
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,060
probably their house or this person's

508
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,129
over here there's an

509
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,460
residential area and then over here is

510
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,930
probably where they work and this is

511
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,900
where I talking about before with

512
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:13,160
vulnerable groups it could be used in a

513
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:15,590
lot of nefarious ways so that's scary

514
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,580
right where is the light at the end of

515
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,590
the tunnel how do we fix it well there

516
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,139
are really five main stakeholders here

517
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,120
we have the ad industry operating system

518
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,630
developers app developers security

519
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,719
professionals and users and I know I use

520
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,660
the word responsible there users aren't

521
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,990
necessarily creating this problem but

522
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,990
we've kind of not done much to stop it

523
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,659
so for the ad industry as owners of this

524
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,300
technology and stewards of your

525
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,890
customers privacy and security it's your

526
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,250
responsibility to protect their

527
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,440
information six-digit precision isn't

528
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,710
really necessary for almost every ad

529
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,470
campaign you'll ever run

530
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,240
there are self-regulation organizations

531
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,010
the Interactive Advertising Bureau and

532
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,140
the digital advertising Alliance and

533
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,820
while they do a lot of good it doesn't

534
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,200
seem like they're regulation is really

535
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,929
helping in this instance because if

536
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,280
somebody can do something like this then

537
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,630
they really need to step their game up

538
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,790
and do a better job of protecting

539
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:24,320
consumers the ad industry needs to limit

540
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,530
the use of location they need to be

541
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,360
asked advertisers to be more specific

542
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,910
why they need geolocation information

543
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,939
and why they need it to be how specific

544
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,550
they're asking for one thing that they

545
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,650
can do to kind of increase the amount of

546
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:43,340
safety and privacy here is add noise to

547
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,720
geo data even the difference of a few

548
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,240
hundred meters could make an enormous

549
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,100
impact on the efficacy of surveillance

550
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,600
techniques they already do this but they

551
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,850
could do a better job of thoroughly

552
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,080
vetting the participants anyone looking

553
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,730
at the advertisements that I ran

554
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,830
especially at the beginning could have

555
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:05,540
said why are you running these

556
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:07,100
advertisements at all they could do a

557
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,840
better job of making sure that every

558
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,530
demand-side platform is upholding their

559
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,709
commitment

560
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,470
to user privacy and safety it's tempting

561
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,540
to bow to the demands of advertisers

562
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,410
they're always going to want more and we

563
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,389
need to draw the line somewhere

564
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,330
requiring advertisers to set parameters

565
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,400
instead of disseminating data raises the

566
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,919
cost and difficulty what we need to do

567
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,010
is move the bidding algorithm back into

568
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:36,170
the black box and stop disseminating

569
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:39,860
this information forward I came across

570
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,930
an article that I really enjoyed a paper

571
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,090
called a droid and they talk about

572
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,550
privilege separation for applications

573
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,649
and advertisers in Android and pretty

574
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,530
much the gist of it is that they're

575
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,410
asking Android to build a feature where

576
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,120
there's two different geolocation

577
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,740
permissions there's two different

578
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,149
permissions for different types of data

579
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,370
collection there's one for the

580
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,690
application itself and then there's one

581
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,209
for the advertisements that you would

582
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:09,260
run inside the application this is kind

583
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:11,480
of a a breakdown of how they're

584
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,450
proposing it would work and I think they

585
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,220
did an excellent job of it and I asked

586
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,550
around to see if Google ever

587
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,770
contemplated incorporating this into the

588
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,379
Android operating system and all I heard

589
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:32,629
was that it never really got brought

590
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:34,100
back up again AB developers protect your

591
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,290
customers you're the first line of

592
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:41,780
defense a lot of times people say this

593
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,340
and I I don't know if this is really the

594
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,850
attitude I've never worked for an app

595
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,379
developer but the attitude I think that

596
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:53,810
you need to have is that all third-party

597
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:56,150
code is dangerous make sure that you

598
00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:00,610
employ security professionals to perform

599
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:03,530
both internal and external audits and

600
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,330
one thing that I think we could do is

601
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:09,410
offer alternative forms of monetization

602
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,020
Facebook says that they'll never charge

603
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,190
money for their service but maybe a paid

604
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,350
opt-out is just what we need

605
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,330
this could exaggerate economic

606
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,179
inequality inequality sure

607
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,280
so offering your entire content

608
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,640
unsupported and then only monetizing

609
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,290
premium

610
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,090
features that aren't necessary for the

611
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,350
function of your app could be one way

612
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,550
that you could solve that but this is

613
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,449
definitely something that I think we

614
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:34,220
need to explore more

615
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:36,920
I don't own a tech company I don't

616
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,480
report to investors so I can't say that

617
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,400
I know all of the solutions these

618
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,720
problems or all the arguments but I

619
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,340
think this is a conversation that we

620
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:49,580
definitely need to have so now it comes

621
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,929
to us right security professionals we

622
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,810
are the eyes of the company and we

623
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,310
should be advocates for their customers

624
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,379
we need to fight for more reasonable

625
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,970
collect collection practices asking the

626
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,280
question when do we need to collect this

627
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,570
information and how are we really

628
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,100
supposed to be disseminating it make

629
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,580
noise don't let your clients and

630
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:14,000
employers be blinded by profit encourage

631
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,530
them to stand up for their customers and

632
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,350
when you're testing make sure that use

633
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,520
human analysis one thing that I think a

634
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,169
lot of people see you whenever they're

635
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,330
testing these apps is that information

636
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,520
can be encoded or encrypted it can be

637
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,080
broken up and displayed in chunks it can

638
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,250
be transformed and it makes automated

639
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,800
tests and really hard and something that

640
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,050
I'm going to drill over and over step up

641
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,790
and support legislation and regulation

642
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,879
that restrict the collection and

643
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:44,149
distribution of sensitive information so

644
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:48,140
users where users we're also security

645
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:50,900
professionals but where users add in

646
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,960
script blockers can be handy I mean this

647
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,300
isn't a solution the problem is not on

648
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,640
the user end but in order to protect

649
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,550
yourself you could use false accounts

650
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,400
you can use GPS roofers you can disable

651
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,409
location services or even refuse to use

652
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,600
abusive apps and pretty much all of this

653
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,010
stuff is really inconvenient and being

654
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,199
somebody who doesn't have a Facebook

655
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:16,250
account I can say that it's really

656
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,100
inconvenient but one thing that we can

657
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,780
also do is support privacy legislation

658
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,550
so I have here a list of organizations

659
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:27,920
that are Pro privacy it's a long list

660
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,200
and I'm probably missing a majority of

661
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,270
the organizations but there's the

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,830
researching this this topic and if

680
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,120
you're interested in learning more this

681
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:22,939
might be a good thing to take a picture

682
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:27,168

I'll wait for the flashes to stop and

686
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,169
and you know what I'll tweet this out

687
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,830
too so just look for amnesiac and I'll

688
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:56,570
have a somewhat shortened version of

689
00:30:48,830 --> 00:31:00,530
that list you ready okay

690
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:03,500
oh we sitting in this room at this

691
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,480
conference and all of the conferences

692
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,580
like this that we attend we represent a

693
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,440
comparatively tiny collection of people

694
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,780
who truly understand the dangers of this

695
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,370
system this is a real problem that

696
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,720
affects every member of the digital

697
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:19,428
society and it's not going to get better

698
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,320
we need to improve our own systems and

699
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,630
we need to hold our service providers to

700
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:28,990
a higher standard and I'm going to leave

701
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,990
you with one more movie clip

702
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:40,460
unethical dangerous we've turned every

703
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,130
cellphone in Gotham into a microphone

704
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,330
and a high frequency generator receiver

705
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:49,730
you took my sonar concept and applied it

706
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,889
to every phone in the city half the city

707
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,160
feeding you saw now you can image all of

708
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,160
God

709
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:02,330
this is wrong I've got to find this man

710
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:05,689
lucious at what cost

711
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:09,260
the database is an lg encrypted it can

712
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,630
only be accessed by one person this is

713
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,470
too much power for one person that's why

714
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:17,809
I gave it to you well you can use it to

715
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,470
spy on 30 million people listen part of

716
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,470
my job description

717

enrage your opponent city you can

719
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:31,429
triangulate his position

720
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,539
I'll help you this one time but consider

721

Enterprises I won't be you finish type

724

in your dish

725
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:52,490
and another intentional freeze-frame

726
00:32:50,440 --> 00:33:00,299
thank you very much

727
00:32:52,490 --> 00:33:04,780
[Applause]

728
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,629
any questions I guess since I got here

729
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,428
first I'll jump in so I'm the general

730
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,280
counsel of an advertising technology

731
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,540
company and oh hi hi I've spent the last

732
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,120
two-and-a-half years that I've been

733
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,040
working for my employer getting rid of

734
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,889
data we didn't need and we've seen no

735
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,549
decrease in our profits at all for doing

736
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:26,970
that thank you yeah I wanted to ask you

737
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,040
though we notice on our network about

738
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,290
20% of the people have enabled limit ad

739
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,659
tracking on their iOS device or enabled

740
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,190
opt out of interest-based ads which is

741
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,990
the same terminology on Android devices

742
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,179
right and you didn't provide that as a

743
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,530
tip for how to shut this down but it

744
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,570
seemed like just going into your

745
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,520
settings and enabling that would have

746
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,049
opted anybody out of your type of

747
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,580
surveillance is that right you know

748
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,590
that's a really good point I didn't have

749
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,780
an opportunity to test that I have a

750
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,639
feeling that that might not Ford it as

751
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,750
much as you think it does but I think

752
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,120
that's definitely something that needs

753
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,870
to be looked into cool thank you thank

754
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:05,260
you I only wanted to ask you mentioned

755
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,059
the ability to change your ad ID and I

756
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,030
wanted to know how to do that and could

757
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:12,909
an app be made to kind of do that on the

758
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,429
fly that's a really good point I will

759
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:18,359
tweet out a link to instructions that

760
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:21,520
I'll probably find on Stack Overflow oh

761
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:27,940
I will definitely tweet that out for

762
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:30,879
sure thank you a great talk you briefly

763
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,790
mentioned the fraudulent traffic in ad

764
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,589
networks did you explore that at all did

765
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,029
you find out like that 1% of clicks

766
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,100
right late do you think that was BOTS

767
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,990
like do you have any sense of location

768
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:46,270
from that stuff you know I have no idea

769
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:49,418
and to be honest like I $40 it's it's is

770
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,980
not nothing but it got me the results

771
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:52,658
that I was looking for to an actor to a

772
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,179
certain extent like I still get to test

773
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:57,930
what I was doing so it didn't it didn't

774
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,260
bother me that much that I saw

775
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,330
problematic things in the traffic

776
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,200
so I just didn't think to look any

777
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:08,299
further into it I would say that's

778
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,330
definitely another thing that really

779
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,250
needs to be looked into and I know of

780
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,480
some companies who are dedicating their

781
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:20,619
entire being to investigating ad fraud

782
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,480
off the top my head I couldn't name any

783
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,650
there we go and actually I would

784
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,040
probably say that just about any

785
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,080
advertiser probably has a pretty strong

786
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,000
fraud department that they're that

787
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,529
they're looking into it I'm getting a

788
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,980
shake of the head here so I take that

789
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,980
back

790
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:50,630
I was assuming that but maybe that's not

791
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:51,680
the case any other questions all right

792
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:58,650
thank you

793
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,649
[Applause]
