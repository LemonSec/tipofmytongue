1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,000
so as we all know the Internet is

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,798
everywhere

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,280
there are three billion users of the

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,230
internet on a daily basis and this it

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,400
was invented as a military project and

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,039
it's never straight far from those roots

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,990
but just so we have a common lexicon I'm

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:28,260
gonna give you a crash course in how the

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:30,900
internet works so data centers facility

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,940
used I had computers they look like this

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,570
just racks and racks and racks of

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,070
computers they can be very tall very

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,469
wide their main cost is power this is

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,660
the crux this is a fiber optic cable

15
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,920
this is the main difference between a

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,300
data center and your network at home

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,149
instead of using copper it uses glass

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,108
and light to transmit billions of times

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,390
more information here's what this looks

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,769
like in a data center this is some

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,049
cables running in a junction and

22
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:09,390
surveillance looks a lot like this here

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,210
is a transatlantic cable these run under

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,009
the ocean and connect everything in the

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,320
world to the internet IP addresses are

26
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,930
the near America address for a device on

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,789
a network they have this format with

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,259
respect to images from Wikipedia it's

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,420
not necessary that you know about the

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,720
numbers or binary just that there's a

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,090
numerical address ipv6 is a newer

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,640
version and it fixes the the scarcity

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,450
problem of ipv4 it's been very slow to

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:48,540
be adopted because ISPs make profit on

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:51,600
scarcity so by by keeping ipv6 in the

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,880
like off the off the regular internet

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,559
they've ensured that no other ISPs can

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,490
start up because there are no more IP

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,600
addresses in the Western Hemisphere

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,600
these people decide that

41
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,160
MAC addresses are assigned to the

42
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,250
hardware in your radios either Bluetooth

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,440
Wi-Fi everything that's network capable

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,860
it has a MAC address those MAC addresses

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,720
or given out the the prefixes are

46
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,390
assigned to each vendor by the I Triple

47
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,120
E they look like this and even though

48
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,609
they look like relatively anonymized

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,530
identifiers x' because of this prefix

50
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,650
and the fact that you can look at it and

51
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,010
see what kind of hardware it belongs to

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,160
that MAC address it's you can use it to

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,299
help the anonymize users on the network

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,910
then there's the domain name system

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,860
which takes those things like google.com

56
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,740
we're all familiar with yahoo and

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,260
translates them into numbers which are

58
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,090
the IP addresses so that your computer

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,290
can get the content from another

60
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:59,590
numerical address on the internet so

61
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,560
here's some maps this is fixed broadband

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,510
penetration as you notice there's a

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,420
bunch of countries in the Middle East in

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,220
North Africa that don't report data it's

65
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,470
either because it's not available or the

66
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,600
governments are hostile to the kind of

67
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,340
data collection a lot of those places

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,260
also have a state-run telecom companies

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,650
so they would certainly have that

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,429
information there a lot of places in the

71
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,100
region are very hostile to like non like

72
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,489
NGO work especially anything that can be

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,859
seen as like an economic colonizer it's

74
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:39,090
pretty like the World Bank or the IMF so

75
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,230
this data is hard very hard to collect

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,780
there's another there's a couple ways to

77
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,480
look at here are geotagged tweets as you

78
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,230
can see the same types of the same

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,070
places tend to get excluded like most of

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:57,640
Africa South America Asia particularly

81
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:01,390
the former Soviet states in the middle

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,809
and that can be and here is a map of

83
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,059
geotag Wikipedia articles so you don't

84
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:11,040
necessarily have to be there but you can

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,299
see that like even things about places

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,340
disenfranchised huge chunks of the world

87
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,389
like Western Europe and the United

88
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,340
States almost totally

89
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,620
and yeah North Africa and the Middle

90
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,508
East have a lot of desert but so does

91
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,310
the American Southwest and as you see

92
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,330
right across as you cross the Mexican

93
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,340
border

94
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,490
the density of geotags in the u.s.

95
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:34,210
disappears so it has less to do with

96
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,490
like geology than it does have to do

97
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,818
with socioeconomic status of the users

98
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,789
here average download speeds around the

99
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:47,530
world and I know it's hard to read but

100
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:54,219
the green is around 25 and the the red

101
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:56,559
is zero megabits per second and the the

102
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:58,990
reason that's so disproportionate is

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,169
because as you can see the the

104
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,310
transatlantic cables favored

105
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,979
particularly the United States but also

106
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,969
Western Europe and places around the

107
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:12,490
Mediterranean and those are also

108
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:14,560
countries that have strong economies so

109
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,590
the investment in these cable

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,589
infrastructure being so expensive they

111
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,698
it requires you know enough people users

112
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:25,810
on the other end to make it worthwhile

113
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,229
here's a map of all the internet

114
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,180
exchange points which are the particular

115
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,940
type of data centers that's used to

116
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,940
exchange traffic between networks say

117
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,810
between Verizon and Sprint or Google and

118
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:43,919
Facebook and you know this will give you

119
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,310
an idea of where there are large

120
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,438
internet points that your average not

121
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,080
consumer but a company could plug into

122
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,669
as you see the the same places get

123
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,669
excluded over and over again

124
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,830
so this all this architecture you've

125
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,409
seen because of the centralization

126
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,659
because of the fact that there's like

127
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:14,110
root certificate authorities because the

128
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:17,949
fact that all of this data moves up what

129
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,319
looks like a tree where each cable line

130
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,719
gets bundled with others and until you

131
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,089
get to data center where you have like

132
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,469
millions and millions of users it lends

133
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,259
itself very well to surveillance

134
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,620
Snowden was able to show us exactly the

135
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,460
extent

136
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:37,030
that New York is home to at least a

137
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,900
couple NSA listening posts this was

138
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,530
reported by the intercept and was broken

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,020
by Snowden

140
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,650
so 33 Thomas Street down by the federal

141
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,820
building this is where they listen to

142
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:54,969
other country satellites in you can see

143
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,599
you if you you can see the satellites on

144
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,520
the roof they're like say like 10 or 15

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,440
feet across which means they're at

146
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,310
that's the size they used to connect to

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:10,270
space so they almost certainly used in

148
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,190
my satellite connections here's a slide

149
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,669
from the Snowden leaks that shows the

150
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,510
number over 30 days and I think 2012

151
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,180
that they collected six billion records

152
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,750
at this location

153
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,870
and so that's and when when they say

154
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,660
records they mean instances of

155
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,700
communication or metadata between two

156
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,000
people they want to target or even just

157
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,800
one if we zoom in on this last slide you

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,760
can see actually the types of data that

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,080
they're collecting sorry so do like and

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,539
how they're doing it so there's a

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,010
variety of methods they're using things

162
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,510
like stingrays to pick up 2g and 3G

163
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,120
signal is unencrypted over-the-air

164
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,260
they're tapping Marine cables that are

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,210
running out of these buildings they in

166
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,440
less-developed parts of the world

167
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,190
high-powered cordless phones are used

168
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,139
instead of cell phones that will extend

169
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,580
like network coverage maybe 10 or 20

170
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,710
kilometers and so you can pick those up

171
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,840
over-the-air those are generally

172
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,969
unencrypted there's sniffing other

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,979
countries satellite data they're tapping

174
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,870
into the old telephone network from the

175
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,699
90s and before and then they have this

176
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,199
term DNI for digital network

177
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,660
intelligence which they just is a

178
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,070
generic word for the Internet so things

179
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,250
like Twitter and Facebook would fall in

180
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,250
that category

181
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:39,919
so this is project wind stopped in its

182
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:44,630
run by GCHQ there's no clear evidence

183
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:47,180
about where this location is GCHQ is the

184
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,880
UK's version of the NSA as you can see

185
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,390
here it collected 40 billion 14 billion

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,610
records in the same 30-day time period

187
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:59,600
part of the reason for this gap between

188
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:02,060
the u.s. one the the foreign one is the

189
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,070
foreign intelligence courts and the fact

190
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:10,250
that it's technically illegal for the

191
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:12,320
NSA to spy on American citizens all

192
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,930
other foreign partners collected about

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,930
four billion records in the same time

194
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,910
here's here's where the records come

195
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,240
from Green is low red is hot so you can

196
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,219
see Iran and Pakistan have the most

197
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,900
lesser than Afghanistan because we have

198
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,710
troops on the ground and then you know

199
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:40,760
more with their like normal enemies

200
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:43,490
against Russia China this is a NSA

201
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,530
satellite outpost in Ontario can find on

202
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,600
Google Maps

203
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,339
it doesn't exist on any government

204
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,720
records that I can find but there's

205
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:57,500
pictures in this and imagines this one's

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,180
in Cyprus controlled by GCHQ is used to

207
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,200
monitor the no traffic or n-neither

208
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,239
around the Mediterranean this one's

209
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,430
another strip in Australia we don't know

210
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:14,150
the designation number from the NSA but

211
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:17,660
we do know it's there here's the other

212
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,880
one in Manhattan as copper mountain at

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,110
60 Hudson Street it's one of the main

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:30,320
data centres who here uses digitalocean

215
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:35,690
yeah they're there yeah one of those is

216
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,130
and then yeah so that one's kind of

217
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,180
infamous in the documents because

218
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,430
there's no doorknob on the door where

219
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,640
the NSA equipment is the agent would

220
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,640
bring

221
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:53,429
so here's the leak this is a slide and

222
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:58,319
again from the stun weeks showing the

223
00:10:53,429 --> 00:11:00,179
exact mechanisms for copy you see a

224
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,549
bunch of Glick code words here like line

225
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,529
II which is used as a generic word

226
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:07,860
really gathering Network intelligence

227
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:11,519
and then fairview is the project that's

228
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:15,269
being right out of the tiny point at the

229
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,279
only a and T building at 33 whatever on

230
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:21,119
the first slide Thomas thank you

231
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,189
so yeah so essentially what they do is

232
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:27,119
they take these like fiber-optic cables

233
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:29,009
to make a copy of it of the all the data

234
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:37,019
going through it and then they send it

235
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:39,059
to a data center in Utah they're you

236
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:43,489
know with a little bit of guesswork and

237
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:46,519
some experience you can guess that

238
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:51,059
there's cooling towers power buildings

239
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:54,059
data halls by some estimations this will

240
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:57,629
be the largest data storage facility in

241
00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:00,569
the world and the NSA has been working

242
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,040
on techniques for storing huge amounts

243
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,559
of data even though the internet

244
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,309
transits like many many petabytes every

245
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,499
hour most of that data is redundant so

246
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,079
you know like a tweet that gets

247
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,670
retweeted a hundred thousand times the

248
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,459
only store one copy of it and then

249
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,929
attach everyone else's metadata to it

250
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,679
and so that way they're able to compress

251
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:24,689
the amount of data they need to monitor

252
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,209
the whole internet in addition they have

253
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:29,459
a project term I'll but turmoil and

254
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:32,069
another project called turbine that are

255
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:36,029
used to either in the case of turmoil

256
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:37,829
attack attacked encryption systems like

257
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,429
on the host computers and then in

258
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:44,790
turbine to bring the decryption using

259
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:48,779
brute force or other like more clever

260
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,860
Tiffany's so while we think things might

261
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,819
be safe

262
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,570
it's only a matter of time and China and

263
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:58,790
a company called d-wave systems

264
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:03,530
have both claim they have content

265
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,329
leaders that were and if that's true the

266
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:10,300
one-way functions that we need for

267
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:10,300
encryption to work no my variable true

268
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,890
so this is from 2013 and shows a picture

269
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:25,189
of like a nurse's in at censorship

270
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:29,470
around the world things have things have

271
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,470
not changed a whole lot since this was

272
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,050
so in particular these places like to

273
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,020
social censor social media because it

274
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,780
makes it very easy for people to

275
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:46,460
coalesce around things they agree with

276
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:50,360
and come against the government what a

277
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,900
particular thing not on here is Egypt it

278
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,970
while it it did some civilian in 2012

279
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:01,699
and and 16 for a couple years they were

280
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:03,800
doing okay and then in Egypt in 2008

281
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,290
right there in the Mediterranean near

282
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,750
the near that canal one of the

283
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,790
translated cables cut and it knocked out

284
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:15,770
internet to huge chunks of the world

285
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:21,860
just by a single failure so that's not a

286
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:24,640
very stable system and then 2011 there's

287
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,210
street protests started in January 25th

288
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,830
what you might know is Tahrir Square and

289
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,080
later that day Twitter Facebook and all

290
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,510
their so from the Euro blocked the

291
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,610
country's DNA like top-level DNS servers

292
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,560
were shut down BGP route through

293
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,530
manually withdrawn by every system in

294
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,599
his in the country and Google deployed

295
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,300
and then within I think three or four

296
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,070
days Google was deploying tweet to

297
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,699
speech technology so Egyptians could

298
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:58,160
call and tweet using a using of pts put

299
00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:00,140
in phone and then on january 28th Barack

300
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,310
Obama gave a speech reaffirming the

301
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,010
right of everyone in the world of

302
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,469
internet access and how what Egypt does

303
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,880
now is like irreversible and you can see

304
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,790
the mistakes

305
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,770
been playing out and now with more and

306
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:18,349
more strength from the country and

307
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,900
January 31st Tahrir Square gets totally

308
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,480
flooded the military is called out to

309
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,040
clear the square and they can't because

310
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,240
people are laying in front of the the

311
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,680
tires and Mubarak steps down the

312
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,680
internet ban is lifted

313
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:44,630
so last year I I was abroad in Kurdistan

314
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,790
working with a university there to build

315
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,820
build out their wireless network and

316
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:53,180
while we're there I don't know why you

317
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,210
but I do 99% of all of my research on

318
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:59,719
Wikipedia so well is there Wikipedia got

319
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:02,860
blocked and it was a huge detriment and

320
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,230
it was blocked in particular because

321
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,790
there is a Wikipedia article that it had

322
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,940
a bunch of evidence of the aerilon

323
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:14,390
regime working with Isis and training

324
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,430
orders and training people in Turkey to

325
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,970
then go fight across the board against

326
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,829
the Kurds and I don't want to reach out

327
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,080
to Wikipedia and said hey I need you to

328
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,020
take that down Wikipedia goes I don't

329
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:33,290
think you understand how Wikipedia works

330
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:34,970
and so Wikipedia got banned so we

331
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,030
reached out to interpret that so the

332
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,280
interplanetary file system which is a

333
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,959
distributed system was able to throw up

334
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:49,370
a mirror this is a shot from their blog

335
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:54,500
took five days to undo what the Turkish

336
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:57,380
government had done so the reason IPS

337
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,770
were ipfs works is a couple really good

338
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:05,000
design decisions one like get we hash

339
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:07,069
all the content so that your content

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,209
gets compressed in a unique way which

341
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,920
means that it can be served from

342
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,420
anywhere and

343
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,700
in itself becomes its own like

344
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,890
certificate authority which leads us to

345
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,220
trust the storage because this patent is

346
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,790
self verified I don't need each tiny TLS

347
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,170
or any other tcp/ip security mechanism

348
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,659
to make sure that it is what I'm

349
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,290
expecting its peer to peer we don't need

350
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,720
it doesn't need tcp/ip it to IP FL no

351
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,120
it's on the same network without IP

352
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,760
addresses would still find content from

353
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,330
each other and in that sense it's fully

354
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,370
distributed it does not it doesn't care

355
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,500
about network partitions I can start

356
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,270
downloading a piece of content get

357
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,280
kicked off line move to a different

358
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,860
place in the world plug into the

359
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,750
internet or to an IP v network and start

360
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,209
downloading content exactly where you

361
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,860
started I don't know of another

362
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:05,930
downloader that will do that except

363
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:07,310
torrents and yeah but so the problems

364
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,190
were like it didn't work in a

365
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,139
traditional browser the documentation

366
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,360
was in English and we were trying to you

367
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,360
know teach people about these high level

368
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,939
cryptographic things who were maybe new

369
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,169
users of the Internet most of the people

370
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,680
only had smartphones there's a lot of

371
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,970
language barriers people expect

372
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,090
something like Wikipedia to just work

373
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,850
and in the developing world it was

374
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,889
treated with a lot more respect

375
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,110
I saw newspaper articles that quoted

376
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,030
Wikipedia as a reliable source which

377
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,740
would not be accepted here and so

378
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,510
there's like it comes with it's a lot

379
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,220
more official I had a hard time

380
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,970
explaining to people that I didn't work

381
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,980
for Wikipedia I worked with them and it

382
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,500
just didn't really work

383
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,170
additionally Wikipedia was unable to

384
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,470
support those projects because they were

385
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:03,470
worried about their staff and volunteers

386
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,910
in Turkey getting murdered so that's

387
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:08,540
always the consideration when you're

388
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,460
dealing with big orgs make sure that the

389
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:16,240
politics you want to play are actually

390
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,230
something they can play with so the

391
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,470
turkey blocks the same people who

392
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,520
tweeted at the beginning they

393
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,820
I did a randomized probe during the

394
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,730
Turkish elections and the Internet and

395
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,809
this is a map of where the internet was

396
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,940
working there is if if there were

397
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,210
network outages they would be red there

398
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,370
are gaps only because of the sampling

399
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,240
and so what we see from this is that

400
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,399
Turkey took a queue and realized that it

401
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,230
it blows up in their face when they try

402
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,940
to sensitive the internet and so they

403
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:58,150
didn't try anything during the election

404
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:59,919
and everyone's silver one handily so

405
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,320
Russia this summer tried to block

406
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,090
telegram and it didn't work out so well

407
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:12,939
they ended up having the block like two

408
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:16,270
million you know that's if you suddenly

409
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,159
have like two million of your leg forty

410
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,230
billion things go down but it's like the

411
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,030
most central two million like everything

412
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,220
kind of collapses um

413
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:30,370
total Internet traffic goes down that

414
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,929
day like twelve person and the reason

415
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,449
they had to block so many IP addresses

416
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,179
is because of domain fronting where as

417
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,520
an application developer puts their

418
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:42,250
application like signal or telegram on

419
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,650
to a cloud service so that when I'm

420
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,179
connecting to it as a user it looks like

421
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,900
I'm going to Google their comm or

422
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:53,679
amazon.com instead of signals website

423
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:56,799
and regimes are reluctant to block that

424
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,260
whole sale until Russia did this they

425
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,480
had never blocked it wholesale because

426
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,629
of the collateral damage to things like

427
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,909
banking even the country's own security

428
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:13,840
operations probably are hosted in this

429
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:16,270
cloud and so on 12:16 Egypt blocked all

430
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,039
VoIP services buying another round of

431
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,970
protests against the new regime and

432
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,160
within a week open Western assistance

433
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,980
used

434
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm fronting to get signal back online

435
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:36,670
in Egypt and this is from May of this

436
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,650
year after the Russia she had happened

437
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:44,330
maxie who is the lead developer of

438
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:47,180
signal got this from Amazon it's clear

439
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,730
here that even though certain companies

440
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,160
may have helped in the past the the goal

441
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:58,640
here is profit not getting people the

442
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:01,010
Internet Nexus because of that the

443
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,650
telegram founder is offering millions of

444
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,780
bitcoins to anyone who can figure out

445
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,050
how to solve these problems because

446
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,090
right now you cannot use telegram in

447
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,629
Russia without pretending like you're

448
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,629
not in Russia

449
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,530
so we've all we've all heard the the

450
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,560
social credit system in China it's

451
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,000
actually been a really long-term plan it

452
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:30,169
started with the Great Firewall in the

453
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,120
90s and then there's Golden Shield which

454
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,890
is used to protect like natural security

455
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,919
secrets in the golden Canon which is a

456
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,890
giant DDoS tool and now and there's a

457
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,780
new cybersecurity law that will overall

458
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,870
out in 2020 in which every person has to

459
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,430
use this app developed by Alibaba that's

460
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:55,879
essentially them episode of black mirror

461
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:57,590
just going over that again so China has

462
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,880
10 times the number of surveillance

463
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,379
cameras in New York City just blew my

464
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,380
mind a no idea

465
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,870
this is this was published by a

466
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,960
newspaper in China about the long-term

467
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,189
plans it was published as not critical

468
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,150
but it's like hey look at all the great

469
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,500
things this can do so and in a lot of

470
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,240
ways these are these are things we've

471
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:30,280
instituted in the United States we just

472
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:32,920
call them capitalism so like you know

473
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,300
this machine thing can figure out what

474
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,130
school you go to what job you get

475
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,870
whether you can leave the country you

476
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,670
know it's it's really not anything

477
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,879
different than we have here except this

478
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,430
is actually open right this these are

479
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,430
documents being planned and executed by

480
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,590
late legislative branches in the United

481
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,330
States we just have credit score and one

482
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:58,209
of our Facebook cells to your

483
00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:00,699
advertisers so yeah

484
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,390
here's the here's the screenshot of the

485
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,490
Alibaba app is in I guess alpha now and

486
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,740
you can get discounts at Alibaba

487
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,690
or you can get banned from Alibaba if

488
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:17,050
you refuse to pay your creditors it's

489
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:19,720
pretty limited right now and now the new

490
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,120
move is to instead of building these

491
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,860
surveillance camera systems and getting

492
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,270
people to watch these cameras and

493
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,370
building and facial recognition

494
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,560
technology and storing other data

495
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,260
they're just gonna recruit everyone who

496
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,830
has the app if you see something say

497
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,460
something right yes so yeah and China

498
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,500
has far and away the most users of the

499
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,190
Internet so they're gonna have nearly a

500
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,240
billion people

501
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,240
surveilling each other

502
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,670
I you know this you guys are familiar

503
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:03,440
with this Cambridge analytically where

504
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,990
87,000 earth so I had 270,000 people

505
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,390
were able to expose the data of 87

506
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,710
million the difference in a variety of

507
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:15,770
countries all around the world unless

508
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:36,620
the United States they're everyone's

509
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:37,370
favorite clip so we all know how we feel

510
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,310
about it right

511
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,489
so why is it that capitalism keeps doing

512
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:47,050
this well there's Pat sorry

513
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:49,520
well there's power in it there's money

514
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:52,550
Steve Bannon worked at Cambridge

515
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,210
analytic had connections to the original

516
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:59,899
researcher cogent and they all work for

517
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,940
the Trump campaign and they used the

518
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,950
they allegedly used this data although

519
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,510
it hasn't been proven yet to build

520
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:09,290
psychographic profiles

521
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:12,920
according to Christopher Wiley who

522
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:15,320
worked for Cambridge analytical and they

523
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,160
use of psychographic profiles to do the

524
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,070
kind of targeted advertising to get

525
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,720
people not to vote but it didn't largely

526
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,909
to get people who they thought would

527
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,930
vote for Hillary to get them to not show

528
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,460
up and in general uses some of the

529
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,020
things Facebook knows about you in the

530
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,590
left you've got you know like things

531
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,350
you've exposed yourself and then on the

532
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,179
right here things like I I don't I have

533
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,179
no idea how they get some of this

534
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:50,170
how do they know what year my car away

535
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,340
was lady wait I they buy it like I guess

536
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,929
they're buying these records from team

537
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,740
these why the Dean bees get to sell

538
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:58,090
these records I don't understand and so

539
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,920
New York City is getting its own massive

540
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,199
surveillance network we thought Lincoln

541
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,170
might see there's 8,000 kiosk plan

542
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,800
there's six gigabits of fiber there's

543
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,500
been 42 terabytes of data transmitted on

544
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,200
average across the network every week

545
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:17,410
for the last two years since this has

546
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,020
been rolled out however the average

547
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,120
session time or a separate session data

548
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,090
is less than a hundred kilobytes so that

549
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,639
means the average user is using it just

550
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,280
enough to transmit their like to

551
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,340
transmit some data to Google about you

552
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,330
know advertising or where they work or

553
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:40,540
whatever in addition there's a there's a

554
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,250
Bluetooth monitoring radio for no reason

555
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,690
like it's unexplained anytime they're

556
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,020
asked about it they're like oh it's off

557
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:50,230
as if that was if we believed them right

558
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,420
there's six strands of fiber which if we

559
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,970
apportioned it like optimum our Verizon

560
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:59,050
does would give access to the Internet

561
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,660
to 6 million simultaneous users so but

562
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,159
as I said before the average session

563
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,230
times less than hundred kilobytes so

564
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,179
this thing that could actually fulfill

565
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,650
all of the Wi-Fi needs for the city of

566
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:14,830
New York is used to 90% of the power and

567
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,030
that kiosk goes to display so it's it's

568
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,919
just a billboard

569
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:22,629
it doesn't serves no purpose other than

570
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:27,610
to watch you good news is there's some

571
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:30,340
solutions CG Venus this is a distributed

572
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,740
routing protocol that is absolutely

573
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,510
amazing it's decentralized so it doesn't

574
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,910
require the centralized naming system

575
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,710
that DNS does it uses hashed addresses

576
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,540
that are generated randomly by your

577
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,570
device meaning that the end that you

578
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,760
don't need us in trip' address authority

579
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,590
to thing to hand it out and it uses ipv6

580
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,080
so you have that much larger address

581
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,320
space and because it randomly generates

582
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,059
things you could potentially have some

583
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,029
collisions problems but the

584
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:05,460
or the likelihood of that is like less

585
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:08,889
likely than it's won over

586
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:12,039
sorry it's smaller than one over the

587
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:14,349
number of unit proton atoms in the

588
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,989
universe sorry the number of hydrogen

589
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:19,178
protons in the universe so it's it's

590
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,799
just mad like there's actually no chance

591
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:23,309
of collisions happening unless you have

592
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,619
a bad random number generation somewhere

593
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:29,049
and it provides both Indian encryption

594
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:31,658
between like you know web server but

595
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:34,570
also at each between each half in the

596
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:37,419
network so that I can't look at a packet

597
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,580
header and trace back where it was going

598
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:42,309
and the only downside is is I have to

599
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,349
manually appear with people which I

600
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,789
don't use the downside it means that the

601
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,070
people I can connect to on my network

602
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,139
and I trust in real life and the people

603
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,629
they connect to they trusted realize and

604
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:54,189
if you go on and build this out we could

605
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:56,349
connect all 6 billion people in the

606
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:00,749
world in less than six hops if you

607
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:00,749
assume that every person knows 30 people

608
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:07,330
ipfs this is what we used in Turkey as I

609
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:09,519
said before is content hashed addresses

610
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,080
so it hatches the content and then that

611
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,210
becomes its address on the network

612
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,320
instead of relying on like a domain or

613
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:20,769
an IP it too is distributed anyone can

614
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,080
run an IPS the ipfs node and the whole

615
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,419
network will see it if you configure it

616
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,849
that way and then it can leave federates

617
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,820
so like the data doesn't have to be

618
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:33,039
stored in any one place there are

619
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,129
caching servers to keep light latency

620
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,739
low but if that caching server doesn't

621
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:40,449
have it it will it'll be it'll happily

622
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,210
grab it from somewhere else and because

623
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,289
there's no trust and we're tired and

624
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,299
because we're hashing the content if you

625
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:49,029
change the content by like introducing

626
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:52,809
malware or something the link changes

627
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:56,169
and so you can introduce malware on an

628
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:58,779
IP at the best gives a patent and then

629
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:01,419
mesh networks in general a really good

630
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:04,899
they're designed with the idea that

631
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:06,339
things break and that and the networking

632
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:10,000
shouldn't require a system administrator

633
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:11,530
to work and so there

634
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,480
designed to route around gaps in the

635
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,850
network or failures it doesn't care

636
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,890
about topology which means if there is

637
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,990
if you can't do one person a 30-person

638
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,550
it always works to the same which means

639
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,160
the barriers of entry are really really

640
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,710
low we're working on some devices now

641
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,900
that will be just totally plug-and-play

642
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,880
updates will come remotely and there's

643
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,700
two radios so that even if one interface

644
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,860
goes down we'll have access to it and

645
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,580
the cool thing about mesh is when you

646
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,659
have networks wireless networks

647
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,879
cooperating with each other instead of

648
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,370
each one kind of carving out their own

649
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,220
space in the spectrum you can get more

650
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:51,610
and more throughput in the same spectral

651
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:54,100
resources through simulations done by

652
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,740
the entropy that you can increase

653
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,050
capacity of already in place networks by

654
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,850
a one point four to seven times by

655
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,629
including mesh for adding protocols and

656
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:06,429
all of this is independent of tcp/ip so

657
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,020
we don't we don't need the DNS we don't

658
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,640
need any of those problematic things

659
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,129
that keep breaking keep getting attacked

660
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,990
by botnets we can everyone can just host

661
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:19,690
it yourself the the main problem is in

662
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:21,550
2016 the FCC shut down essentially

663
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,740
development on open source routers

664
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,200
because they were worried that people

665
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,970
were able to change settings about the

666
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,370
radios and make them no longer FCC

667
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,430
compliant we figured out a way around

668
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:36,159
that we by F atheros 9k chips then we

669
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,110
put them on a custom PCB this is called

670
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,950
the Libre Rider is developed by ultra

671
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:45,010
Mundi in Argentina and it's the first

672
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,260
fully open source router stack and we're

673
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,780
shipping 2,500 of these around the world

674
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,830
to five continents this summer early

675
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,290
tests show that this can get full

676
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:00,360
Wireless in speeds of 100 megabits at

677
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:02,530
150 meters in downtown Toronto that is

678
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,629
after years of ranking which method that

679
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,670
mesh networks this is single-handedly

680
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:10,960
the best device I've ever used

681
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:13,240
additionally the radios are swappable as

682
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,160
you know wireless technologies improve

683
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,730
over time

684
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,240
routing hasn't really changed since the

685
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,240
80s

686
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,080
and so but radios change every three

687
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,779
years so we

688
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,000
included swappable ports so that you can

689
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:29,769
buy the relatively expensive router

690
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,269
board and then in three to five years

691
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:34,419
when you need to upgrade for more

692
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:38,950
capacity or bandwidth you just swap the

693
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:43,269
radio out for a few dollars in places so

694
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,669
this is a map of the city I made this is

695
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:49,419
I used a database from the New York City

696
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:53,200
open data that was a list of all of the

697
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:54,850
city funded buildings which means

698
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,250
there's already wireless networks

699
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:01,209
they're managed by the Department of IT

700
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:04,690
so if we took one of those Libre routers

701
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:07,779
which is scale cost around $50 to $100

702
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,550
power options and got kind of stuff we

703
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,290
could have a citywide network in New

704
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,619
York that covers 91 percent of the

705
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:17,980
residents for and the total cost of this

706
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:20,139
is for the hardware and do it times

707
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,570
around 20 million dollars the city's

708
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:25,240
already spent 30 million dollars on

709
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,970
three failed wireless projects one was

710
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:32,290
to hook up 7,000 people at a project in

711
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:34,239
the Bronx one was to give 4G hotspots to

712
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,429
people who live in neighborhoods that

713
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,678
all have 4G and other ones have been

714
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:46,389
small community grants that have

715
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:49,690
disappeared as far as I can tell so so

716
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,399
in conclusion the the only way to fix

717
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,399
these like centralized failures with the

718
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,460
Internet is just start over and route

719
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,880
around them

720
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,880
any questions

721
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:16,579
[Applause]

722
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,579
[Music]

723
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:35,800
come up and use the mic it was a very

724
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,440
good presentation thank you very much

725
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,660
the data that everybody knows about on

726
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,530
Facebook comes from a company called

727
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:48,109
axiom corporation they have decided to

728
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,530
sever their relationship with Facebook

729
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,820
but that's where the data came from

730
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,240
that's a wonderful names information

731
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,860
thank you

732
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,120
that's actually if you guys want to look

733
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:09,040
up where your data is for sale go to

734
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:15,620
this URL lists li sts let's slow down

735
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:18,980
oft s dot next mark dot-com and by the

736
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:24,460
way their app on the phone stinks useful

737
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:31,760
computer thinks we did anyone else

738
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:39,440
anyone else have questions oh sorry

739
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:42,500
lists that next mark calm so yeah so

740
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,960
from the traditional internet stack you

741
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,030
listed a lot of problems with it

742
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,190
has there been like a threatened auto

743
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,870
for you know the distributed stuff that

744
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,850
you're talking about where there's like

745
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,270
things that there's like you know

746
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:59,509
problems that we still have to deal with

747
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:03,259
given that we use some of this to combat

748
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:05,240
a homicidal genocidal regime and

749
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,580
everyone involved in the process is

750
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,069
still alive I'd say it works okay at

751
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:13,279
least in the short term

752
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,280
[Applause]

753
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:22,450
any other questions where's a good

754
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:24,750
centralized place to find more

755
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:29,859
information on mesh networks

756
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,750
so yeah Internet Society table checkout

757
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:34,750
are they our networks table which is in

758
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:37,230
the middle that that has people from

759
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:40,000
Philadelphia Massachusetts Pittsburgh

760
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,760
Toronto I mean we've got a couple a

761
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,319
couple people commuting in by riot which

762
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,190
is a distributed and federated chat

763
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:51,009
messenger y'all should use it it's great

764
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,690
so but that's actually a big problem we

765
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,960
have a we have a meet up tomorrow night

766
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,160
with all the mesh groups here and we're

767
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,660
gonna need to work on that problem

768
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,129
because in until two years ago all of

769
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,190
these groups were working totally

770
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,859
independently and we're using this hope

771
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,740
as an occasion to start bringing it all

772
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:14,710
together and with the launch of the

773
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:16,689
libre router we'll be able to get cheap

774
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,970
hardware to anyone in the world who

775
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,700
needs it and we can all like develop on

776
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:25,269
the same stack together which will cut

777
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,970
down our volunteer hours massively I'm

778
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:30,819
sure yeah could you repeat where that

779
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,368
meeting is um so meetup the vendor spot

780
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:35,740
it's at if you if you want to come grab

781
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,910
a grab some dinner with a bunch of mesh

782
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,379
people from around the world we're gonna

783
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,660
meet in the Vint in the middle of the

784
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,630
vendors area tomorrow night at 8 p.m.

785
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,250
and it's at a table and it says our

786
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,839
networks and there's like you'll see a

787
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,359
bunch of people hacking on routers and

788
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:53,440
all these weird antennas and probably no

789
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,619
more t-shirts by the by tomorrow there

790
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,750
are still t-shirts I actually have an

791
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:01,960
interesting question yeah

792
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:05,440
you said you required to connect to your

793
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,809
friends with the DNS it's kind of CJD

794
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,200
Nance yeah at cj DNS that kind of sounds

795
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:13,289
like the ring of trust in GPG which has

796
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,970
a notorious flaw as far as privacy goes

797
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:18,569
because now once you publish a with the

798
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:22,180
GPG you have to publish a public key

799
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:23,900
with the signature is that's proving who

800
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,250
all your friends are

801
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,440
which is terrible from a privacy

802
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,980
standpoint because now you finger it on

803
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,210
your contacts sure I mean in so far as

804
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,650
you've fingered a bunch of keys that

805
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,090
aren't attached to any geophysical

806
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,250
address because we're not using IP

807
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,930
addresses the the kind of surveillance

808
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,630
doesn't really work they can know I have

809
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,210
30 friends I don't think they I don't

810
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,860
there's nothing about a random string in

811
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,760
my key file that would tell them who

812
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,000
that person is

813
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,130
okay so it's a key file but it has to be

814
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,150
communicated somehow so there'll be a

815
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,330
network connection

816
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:01,520
yeah they in4 the infrastructure so yeah

817
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:05,900
so in that case now you have an IP

818
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,380
address this easily can get chained for

819
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,800
people who do this kind of realize an IP

820
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:14,950
address required there how else are you

821
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:22,310
going to communicate this information

822
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:26,600
CJ dienes it's not tcp/ip it doesn't

823
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:28,790
require that that's the whole point it

824
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,140
what it does so what it does if you want

825
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,900
to get really technical as it randomly

826
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,150
generates your IP address and then to

827
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,520
route you it increments that to the

828
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,620
closest node like if I'm if I'm at one

829
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,570
and I'm trying to get it to eight and I

830
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,100
know three and four it'll move to three

831
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,200
next because it's the next closest one

832
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,120
day and they'll move to four it has

833
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,399
nothing to do with geography it has

834
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,890
nothing to do with latency or speed it

835
00:40:49,400 --> 00:41:02,680
has everything to do with fewest number

836
00:40:51,890 --> 00:41:02,680
of hops okay any other questions

837
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:17,340
cool thank you

838
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:17,340
[Applause]
