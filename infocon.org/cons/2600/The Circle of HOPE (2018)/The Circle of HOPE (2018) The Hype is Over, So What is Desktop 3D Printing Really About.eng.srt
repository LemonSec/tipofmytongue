1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,520
all right so yeah let's see what I

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,830
signed up for in the talk description

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,870
while the world was falling in love with

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,599
desktop 3d printers as a potential

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,370
disruption to how consumer products

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,680
might be created and manufactured in the

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,660
home a parallel transformation was

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,210
taking place that shows no sign of

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,009
stopping it's time to cut through the

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,240
 and examine the revolution that

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,220
actually took place all right so i'm

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,659
matt griffin director of community for

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,510
ultimate career north america

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a writer community developer adjunct

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,000
professor consultant covering topics

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
such as 3d printing DIY electronics and

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,980
design for digital fabrication I've been

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,590
involved in desktop 3d printing from the

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,578
beginning of this this ancient art which

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,410
is like 2009 at first as part of the

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,510
original team at MakerBot where I was a

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,429
community manager and helped to frame

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,070
the concept of desktop 3d printing as a

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,199
new market evangelizing what is possible

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,650
this technology I continue this work as

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,289
a contributor to make magazine including

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,210
Co starting their annual make 3d printer

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,189
shootout ultimate guide to 3d printing

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,259
series and then as director of community

30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,080
and support at Adafruit where I created

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,700
3d Thursday and authored over 3000 posts

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,570
about 3d printing and related

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,920
technologies

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,240
I joined Ultimaker back in 2015 when we

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,549
first put together a North American

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,798
organization I built the community team

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,110
with the aim to engage our professional

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,299
and education customers in North America

39
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,430
and in the many contexts and fields in

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,180
which they use our hardware software and

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,189
materials my favorite aspect to working

42
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,350
for a company that makes 3d printers is

43
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,869
that when we have the opportunity to

44
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,880
engage with our users directly we aren't

45
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,979
just there to convince engineers and

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,449
designers to buy something like we would

47
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,240
if we had just developed a product

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,310
instead of a tool instead the scenario

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,880
flips the other way it becomes our

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,710
challenge to find ways to work for them

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,079
and with them to help them find ways

52
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,000
that desktop 3d printing technology that

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,889
we are recommending might actually help

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,889
them accomplish their projects designs

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,200
and inventions

56
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,359
so if this isn't your first hope you'll

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,970
no doubt remember that there been talks

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,160
at Hope about 3d printing before a bunch

59
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,440
of them about the technology in general

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,109
about adjacent topics like biological

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,600
molecular compilers implications of

62
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,940
self-replication impending disruption to

63
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,160
our commodity based capitalist economy

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,540
the thrilling spectre of a desktop 3d

65
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,310
printing revolution on the verge of

66
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,950
toppling antiquated methods of

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,630
manufacture about IP rights and what

68
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,940
this technology might do to the Patent

69
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,310
and Trademark paradigms and much more

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,870
the topic has come up a bit I've

71
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,610
attended many of these talks and have

72
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,959
cheered folks on I've had heated

73
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,209
discussions with attendees and

74
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,690
presenters about the latest thinking in

75
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:58,040
2012 and then 2014 and then 2016 and now

76
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,989
2018 and already today I've had at least

77
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,970
two serious-minded conversations with

78
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,190
folks about the death of 3d printing

79
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,260
about treating the topic is something

80
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,940
that concerned us in the past with

81
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,700
little air quotes floating around it

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,340
interrogating why in 2018 do we really

83
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,560
give a flip about it 3d printing is so

84
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,750
hopeful so 2012 so before the fall of

85
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,870
civilization don't we have bigger fish

86
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,239
to fry so what I'm looking to share with

87
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,690
you today is a bit more practical than

88
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,620
has usually been shown here before and a

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,320
shift in our mess without a second and a

90
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,970
shift in perspective to offer a little

91
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,739
bit of a spoiler for my own talk for a

92
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,260
moment if you look back at the total

93
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,510
disruption that folks like me we're

94
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,060
thinking and prophesizing about about

95
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,280
five to ten years ago it's easy to feel

96
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,400
like the promise of desktop 3d printing

97
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,769
with something of a fizzle but the point

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,920
of my talk if there is one is that it is

99
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,840
okay and maybe even a very good idea to

100
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,790
continue to pay a lot of attention to

101
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,730
this topic even even though the hype

102
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,340
bubble certainly popped sometime back in

103
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,630
2014 there are still some pretty darned

104
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,269
interesting things about this technology

105
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,739
as it really works on the ground in ways

106
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,620
that you can leverage the hell out of it

107
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,090
to create your next awesome projects

108
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,280
when the RepRap movement aimed and fired

109
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,620
the idea of desktop 3d printing into the

110
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,869
air there are plenty of hypotheses about

111
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,150
where it might have landed and how hard

112
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,760
it might have come down but the truth of

113
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,219
the matter

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,920
is that when it did come down it wasn't

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,870
a big boom or a mushroom cloud or the

116
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,840
complete eradication of manufacturing

117
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,760
technologies had come before nope the

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,890
technology just sort of climbed out of

119
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,900
its little crater put on an awkward

120
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,380
button-down shirt and glasses and headed

121
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,780
out into the big bad world so before I

122
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,280
get too far ahead of myself let's circle

123
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,650
back to clarify some critical

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,400
terminology for our discussion what is

125
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,989
the term 3d printing mean in general

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,880
3d printing refers to family of

127
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,400
technologies that fabricate physical

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,920
objects these technologies Center on the

129
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,270
use of computer guided devices to

130
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,920
replicate a digital model in the

131
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,370
physical world constructed from raw

132
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,170
materials this new paradigm reverses

133
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,600
traditional manufacturing processes that

134
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,940
typically involve first constructing

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,280
molds and tools or applying tools to cut

136
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,230
carve turn melt or otherwise subtracts

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,510
material from a larger original base

138
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,610
material at the conclusion of

139
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,170
subtractive manufacturing you receive

140
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,420
your part along with a bunch of

141
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,130
discarded waste materials with additive

142
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,310
manufacturing you have the advantage of

143
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,320
receiving just the part that you needed

144
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,390
now there is a good reason that through

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,490
the 3d printing definition that I just

146
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,460
gave feels pretty vague and generalized

147
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,370
because it doesn't really commit to how

148
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,739
the 3d model topology is defined the job

149
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,840
instructions produced nor the chemical

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,270
and mechanical means of building up the

151
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,919
object the specifics for these three

152
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,250
areas differ according to each specific

153
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,390
3d printing technology another label use

154
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,120
for this field is additive manufacturing

155
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,550
while this label is increasingly used to

156
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,730
differentiate the higher in industrial

157
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,120
variants of this class of technologies

158
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,190
and in particular metal printing and and

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,580
also extends beyond the automatic

160
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,400
automated fabrication process itself in

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,169
practice the term is used pretty much

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,609
interchangeably with 3d printing so we

163
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,760
have 3d printing and additive

164
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,070
manufacturing as umbrella terms held up

165
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,380
over an entire host of distinctly

166
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,659
different concepts it is possible to

167
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,130
assemble an entire crowd of engineers

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,920
where each has an entirely different

169
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,780
idea about 3d printing what it's good

170
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,820
for and how the technology works

171
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,679
and all of them can be right at the same

172
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,930
time even if the definitions and

173
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,690
associations are completely at odds with

174
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,750
each other so a question that often

175
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,700
comes up can a 3d printer make anything

176
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,919
well this is a question that does crop

177
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,510
up but let me put it this way a 3d

178
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,060
printer can make anything it is capable

179
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,560
of constructing within the confines of

180
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,840
its build envelope and using the

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,910
materials and material properties it is

182
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,909
able to combine to produce the object

183
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,460
well the 3d printers of today excluding

184
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,669
a handful of the highest in Lamborghinis

185
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,590
sort of industrial cousins are limited

186
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,690
machines compared to fabrication lines

187
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,820
you might stumble on in a modern Factory

188
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,070
remember that fancy bread maker your

189
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,990
aunt gave you as a wedding gift it fits

190
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,730
on your countertop sure but you wouldn't

191
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,890
expect it to offer all the industrial

192
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,750
features you'd find in a commercial

193
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,969
bakery not to mention the staff of

194
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,180
Baker's what you get is an automated

195
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,330
process that should ostensibly result in

196
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,160
bread being produced each and every time

197
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,520
and that's about the limit of the

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,020
promise so we've defined 3d printing and

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,299
additive manufacturing so what is

200
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,479
desktop 3d printing and how is it

201
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,210
different in the desktop plywood age

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,490
this brand new class of 3d printers

203
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,950
didn't resemble the industrial machines

204
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,410
at all so the term was used more to

205
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,150
explain how those laser-cut boxes

206
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,160
bristling with breakout boards and

207
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,710
exposed wiring accomplished something

208
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,380
not completely unlike what rapid

209
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,049
prototyping equipment was producing but

210
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,580
swiftly the desktop 3d printing world

211
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,010
has evolved into a tidier

212
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,760
well-functioning pre-built machine kind

213
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,469
of universe and many of these and in

214
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,750
many cases these machines and how they

215
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,520
look are more recognizable to the public

216
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,280
as 3d printers than their industrial

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,409
counterparts so other points of contrast

218
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,679
between classes of AM technology were

219
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,339
needed the first obvious contrast as a

220
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,870
key differentiator was the size factor

221
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,940
but then there emerged things like

222
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,580
wreaths Reedy's giga BOTS and big rep

223
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,010
and other medium and large format 3d

224
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,680
printers whose pedigree were more with a

225
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,290
desktop 3d printer universe then the

226
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,670
older industrial Am approaches and their

227
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,199
build envelopes were much bigger

228
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,839
than most of the industrial solutions

229
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,510
and so a more reliable gauge these days

230
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,550
would probably be price desktop 3d

231
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,830
printers are additive manufacturing

232
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,410
devices that can be purchased for as

233
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,780
little as a couple hundred dollars up to

234
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,550
five to seven thousand dollars over this

235
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,189
amount and the ownership of the machine

236
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,829
shifts from being what an individual

237
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,810
might pay for a trusted tool up to more

238
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,850
of a business level investment that

239
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,500
factor is not a small one in determining

240
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,740
the core values for this market segment

241
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,510
and we'll talk about that later several

242
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,610
classes of desktop printers exist from

243
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,620
micro or portable to prosumer to

244
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,600
professional desktop and emerging from

245
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,540
this desktop ecosystem are the benchtop

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,610
medium format scales and price points

247
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,949
that I was mentioning earlier that do

248
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,360
share a closer evolutionary link to

249
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,430
desktop printers than an industrial

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,860
printers these definitions vary from

251
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,689
marketplace to marketplace and no doubt

252
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,330
clear definitions will be settled by the

253
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,310
market sooner or later as certain

254
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,590
elements become commodities completely

255
00:09:50,310 --> 00:10:01,310
and certain elements remain premium

256
00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:01,310
features okay oops how I did this way

257
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:12,360
so 3d printing technology has been

258
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:14,950
around a long time let's see here okay

259
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,190
in order to update your understanding of

260
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,630
the role of the technology today I'd

261
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,520
like to take you on a quick tour through

262
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,650
the past making stops along the way to

263
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,630
consider the interesting potential

264
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,160
trajectories as we understood them at

265
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,670
that time

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,770
so let's head back to the 1980s so it's

267
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,630
been over 30 years since Chuck Hall

268
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,660
invented and commercialized stereo

269
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,939
lithography or SLA back in 1984

270
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,329
Carl Decker introduced selective laser

271
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,700
centering SLS in 1988 Scott Crump

272
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,920
invented fused filament fabrication FDM

273
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,080
in the late 80s and then commercialized

274
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,390
it in the 1990s and that's the most

275
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,810
common form of additive technology used

276
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,550
in desktop 3d today so over its first

277
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,069
two decades the field of additive

278
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,380
manufacturing brought under its umbrella

279
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,450
a cluster of related but distinct

280
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,180
technologies there was also things like

281
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,730
Z corpse binder jet printers konnex

282
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:15,339
multi jet printers are cam metal

283
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:18,880
printers so many more so she's probably

284
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,290
found out okay so by the first decade of

285
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,420
this millennium there was already a

286
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,010
firmly established place for 3d printing

287
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,370
in the engineering design and

288
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,810
manufacturing tool chain and a number of

289
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,180
machine manufacturers and service bureau

290
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,979
is working in the space the technology

291
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,680
was typically used as an intermediate

292
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,540
rapid prototyping stage to produce a

293
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,219
physical sample of a part about to be

294
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,800
manufactured so that all the

295
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,390
stakeholders could assess whether the

296
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,189
design was sufficiently complete and

297
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:48,100
well designed for the business to commit

298
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,260
to the expenses of delivering the design

299
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,600
to a machinist foundry or Factory at

300
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,310
that point costly tools molds and

301
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,890
factory liens would then be prepared for

302
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,719
the production of the part in quantity

303
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,760
but the 3d printing machines of this era

304
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,650
were on the whole bulky refrigerator

305
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,630
sized pieces of equipment costing

306
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,790
anywhere from 60,000 to millions of

307
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,220
dollars for a single unit and the parson

308
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,290
cells were quite expensive hundreds to

309
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,290
thousands of dollars so engineers and

310
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,640
designers making use of the technology

311
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,349
tend to think twice before committing to

312
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,240
producing apart

313
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,310
it won't surprise you to hear that there

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,650
were very few replacement knobs for

315
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,420
stoves and cosplay models produced with

316
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,400
this technology at this time though

317
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,829
already there were artists and designers

318
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,810
who found funding routes by hook and

319
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,110
crook to produce unique works using this

320
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,390
industrial technology so the concept of

321
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,040
a desktop 3d printer at this time was as

322
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,960
alien as the idea of a pocket-sized

323
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,849
mainframe computer might have been at

324
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:49,600
the dawn of the computer age but before

325
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,280
ok bring back so this early 2000s

326
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,620
expectation for what additive technology

327
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,180
was good for had emerged from the market

328
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,070
that currently sustained those

329
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,620
businesses but this wasn't the full

330
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,210
story there were already the seeds of

331
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,160
other ideas and purposes for the

332
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,450
technology so in order to go forward

333
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,850
we're gonna head back a little bit to

334
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,010
the past the seeds of this approach to

335
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,560
fabrication is actually as old as nature

336
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,260
nature demonstrates the idea to us for

337
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,819
how to construct big from the small

338
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:21,370
snail shells oysters bones hairs trees

339
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,360
tissues these are not created by carving

340
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,770
down refining existing materials the way

341
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,860
the way most of our manufacturing

342
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,199
methods work but how mountains and

343
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,450
geological formations were originally

344
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,850
made by bringing material together to

345
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,830
build larger structures up or out layer

346
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,470
by layer transformed by heat and

347
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,270
pressure into final shapes it was

348
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,280
inevitable for this entire class of

349
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,199
techniques to build up forms like nature

350
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,510
would enter into our tools and how we

351
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,790
fabricate and manufacture objects and

352
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,260
there were other precedents for how we

353
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,579
were thinking about this kind of stuff

354
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,840
so arthur c clarke

355
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,690
introduced the idea of a replicator

356
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,450
machine in 1964 philip k dick published

357
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,870
a children's book nick in the gloom on

358
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,210
in 1966 that had a plasticy alien that

359
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,010
was described as printing a copy of

360
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,990
anything presenting to it presented to

361
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,640
it and Star Trek introduced the idea of

362
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,650
the replicator which was initially just

363
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,780
a food molecular compiler in the

364
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,310
original series and then they introduced

365
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,949
the term replicator in the next

366
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,310
generation in 1987 which could make

367
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,960
anything not just food so there's a

368
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,819
little bit of a tricky chicken and eggs

369
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,970
element to the fact that additive

370
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,420
manufacturing as a concept was first

371
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,910
cultivated

372
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,040
in our cultural imagination and fine art

373
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,650
Comics film television critical

374
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,719
philosophy even science fiction and then

375
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,939
decades later snatched out of pop

376
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,890
culture as a handy means to explain a

377
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,770
new class of digital fabrication

378
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,400
technologies so let's return to the

379
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,740
early aughts

380
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,740
when additive manufacturing technology

381
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,760
has a clear role in the marketplace and

382
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,250
the OEMs continue to develop and tune

383
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,020
the technology to secure protect their

384
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:07,600
particular share of that market and

385
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:09,400
let's add back the idea that the notion

386
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,220
of a civilization reshaped by the

387
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,380
pervasive use of a technology like rapid

388
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,030
prototyping had already become firmly

389
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,850
established in the popular imagination

390
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:25,240
thanks to art television philosophy

391
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:26,620
science fiction like I said so I swear I

392
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,240
have some slides that are not just

393
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,670
numbers but in 2008 enter the RepRap

394
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,250
movement which provided a bridge between

395
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,890
those ideas and the existing

396
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,750
technologies so dr. Adrian Boyer of the

397
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,300
University of Bath proposed a compelling

398
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,460
alternative to the industrial grade 3d

399
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,469
printers had come before inspired in

400
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,120
part from these sources together with

401
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,730
his own academic background as a

402
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,480
mathematician and an engineer exploring

403
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,760
3d topology his credo make them simple

404
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,770
make them cheap make them so they can

405
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,480
self-replicate

406
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,490
drawing as much from how the world of

407
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,410
culture and imagination dreamed of

408
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,900
Universal fabrication machines and

409
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,180
matter compilers as from the history of

410
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,329
additive manufacturing he produced the

411
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,760
idea of a RepRap at replicating rapid

412
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,910
prototyper so the RepRap movement had

413
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,830
begun and as riprap org a key early

414
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,959
platform for developing and evangelizing

415
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,120
the movement states riprap is about

416
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,770
making self-replicating machines and

417
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,770
making them freely available for the

418
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,689
benefit of everyone RepRap breeds tend

419
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,360
to be designed from the ground up to be

420
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,330
suitable for self-replication relying on

421
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,530
a combination of 3d printed and

422
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,410
commodity level components such as

423
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,420
aluminum extrusions sliders belts

424
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,189
pulleys and similar such that it is

425
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,719
possible to share your bomb

426
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,180
build instructions with another machine

427
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,579
builder in your area or halfway across

428
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,560
the world so that others can duplicate

429
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:57,579
your efforts and benefit from your

430
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,619
exploration this community targeted

431
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:01,060
fused filament fabrication first the

432
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,339
style of additive manufacturing where

433
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,990
thermoplastics are extruded on to a bill

434
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,689
plate building up to the final part

435
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,419
layer by layer in quickly cooling

436
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,939
plastic by tracing out lines and then

437
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,069
filling an infill before moving up and

438
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,289
repeating this process the option had

439
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,389
fewer critical moving parts than SLS or

440
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:21,400
SLA materials were easy to get

441
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,370
inexpensive and it was much safer than

442
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,020
the other am materials and most

443
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,840
important the base patents for this

444
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,240
technology were expiring so the RepRap

445
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,220
movement aims to develop 3d printer

446
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,799
breeds over a series of evolutionary

447
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,990
leaps until eventually the goal of

448
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,299
printer self-replication will be met

449
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,039
completely currently while many of the

450
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,820
electromechanical components can be

451
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:48,520
produced and have been since 2008 and

452
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,700
pretty phenomenal and very difficult

453
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,679
processes but number of the components

454
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,750
such as sensors microcontrollers stepper

455
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,409
motors they're so difficult to produce

456
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,669
using this technology has resulted in an

457
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:03,640
encouragement for the participants to

458
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:06,070
source those as add-on parts or vitamins

459
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,020
as a consequence of the efforts to

460
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,210
source parts and construct each needed

461
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,549
component and the constant flux in

462
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,549
models for parts and their configuration

463
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,860
RepRap units had tended to bear the

464
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,570
fingerprint of the builder so let's

465
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,459
pause for a moment and take stock of how

466
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:24,789
the world reflected on desktop 3d

467
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,309
printing at this time so the industrial

468
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,100
ecosystem scarcely noticed the birth of

469
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:32,200
RepRap industry knew what additive

470
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,149
manufacturing was for rapid prototyping

471
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,850
and while a few of the later revivals

472
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,110
into the space like Z Corp introduced

473
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,240
the opportunity for lower-cost

474
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,549
full-color models that were favorably

475
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,130
received by architectural firms and

476
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:47,530
schools the costs were still in hundreds

477
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,570
of dollars per full-sized parts so not

478
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,250
the democratizing of manufacturing that

479
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,020
RepRap was calling for but the

480
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,220
visibility of these efforts were already

481
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,429
starting to catch the attention of

482
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,630
mainstream media the RepRap ecosystem

483
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,730
itself tended to be

484
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,310
more taken by the idea and challenge of

485
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,440
producing a self-replicating machine and

486
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,240
we're not as concerned with actively

487
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,250
using the results in other projects

488
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,710
beyond the grand design of that

489
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,960
far-distant RepRap device that could

490
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,150
easily spit out child printer after

491
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,180
child printer completely leveling the

492
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,310
access to means of production with the

493
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,130
RepRap movement introduced definitively

494
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,870
as it grew like wildfire online and as a

495
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,970
grassroots science fiction fueled

496
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,550
movement was an ever growing population

497
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,040
of creative in the innovative

498
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,500
individuals thinking what would I

499
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,810
fabricate if I had my own 3d printer

500
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,630
what might change about my life and

501
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:44,230
those around me different questions than

502
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,180
the industrial users and it is no

503
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,220
coincidence that this year was also the

504
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,500
shapeways launched offering consumers

505
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,080
access to the means to produce custom

506
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,880
designs jewelry and simple mechanical

507
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,189
parts using technology that typically

508
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,340
had only been available to industrial

509
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:07,510
customers our b2b kind of pricing

510
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:10,720
context alright so moving forward a year

511
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,480
it's a 2009 - the birth of desktop 3d

512
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,820
printing as a market segment the problem

513
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,380
that drove Zack Smith future co-founder

514
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,030
of MakerBot on the journey that would

515
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,850
lead to the creation of the MakerBot

516
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,430
cupcake cnc the first affordable desktop

517
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,929
3d printer kit in the US was that he

518
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,880
needed a machine to help him produce

519
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:31,660
more RepRap 3d printed parts more

520
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,250
quickly in parallel erik Debruyne future

521
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,160
co-founder Volta maker was a first

522
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,560
outside of dr. Adrian boyars team to

523
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,450
produce a working Darwin RepRap model

524
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,690
from the bomb and instructions developed

525
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,670
online he and his co-founders offered

526
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,310
RepRap building workshops at the proto

527
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,870
space fab lab in Utrecht and they

528
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,970
quickly set their sights on designing

529
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,889
machine of their own as a reaction to

530
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,570
some of the frustrations they faced with

531
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,800
the self-replicating constraints of that

532
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,060
first RepRap breed

533
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,850
similarly back in the US as Zack and

534
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:07,060
crew started making working 3d printers

535
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,360
the focus on making those RepRap parts

536
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,500
fell away pretty quickly so self

537
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,990
replication and easy duplication

538
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:20,540
not requirements for desktop 3d printers

539
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:22,280
in general desktop desktop 3d printers

540
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,639
target first and foremost the strategies

541
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,350
that reliably produce objects emphasis

542
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,570
is about printing over producing

543
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,459
printers but the early history brings

544
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,350
these two approaches together so let's

545
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,990
consider what industry thought of these

546
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,360
new desktop machines and their rival the

547
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,660
first MakerBot booth to CES the Consumer

548
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,550
Electronics Show in 2010 they really

549
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,010
didn't get it at first and having been

550
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,899
so litigious with the other industrial

551
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,520
competitors over the previous decades

552
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,860
they weren't quite sure how to navigate

553
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,450
the expiring patents could they or

554
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,699
should they squash what they saw as

555
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,370
vastly suboptimal versions of their

556
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,630
technology surely the clients who could

557
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,489
pay for real additive manufacturing

558
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,040
technology would never want parts like

559
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,580
that at the same time their businesses

560
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,139
as well we're benefiting from a rising

561
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,870
technology and mainstream reporter

562
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,400
interest in this technology on the other

563
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,320
hand from the perspective of those

564
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,810
participating in desktop 3d printing

565
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,770
world quite a lot was happening probably

566
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,710
more important than the launch of

567
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,420
MakerBot cupcake was the launch of

568
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,030
Thingiverse which preceded the launch of

569
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,620
the machine in general participants in

570
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,139
desktop 3d printing and the RepRap

571
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,610
movement were not mechanically are not

572
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,770
mechanical engineers as much as they

573
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,110
were web developers software developers

574
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,930
and drawing on other technology

575
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,639
backgrounds people who were thrilled to

576
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,590
spend their time exploring how this new

577
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,390
technology worked simply getting the

578
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,379
machines to work at all with something

579
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,760
deeply satisfying in particular given

580
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,110
given how much of this activity was

581
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,580
driven by participation and

582
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,229
communication online so ad hoc hacks and

583
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,020
reverse engineered solutions from other

584
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,210
industries flowed into Thingiverse and

585
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,800
all those participating as individuals

586
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,900
or drumming up desktop 3d printing

587
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,010
machine businesses participated in many

588
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,050
of the same forums and online

589
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,180
communities people hadn't really been

590
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,460
split out yet they weren't yet fighting

591
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,840
and ideas for what would be worth

592
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,450
creating with this newly accessible

593
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,459
technology introduced new users and a

594
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,020
vast range of interests and needs into

595
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,179
the additive manufacturing ecosystem

596
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,580
from researchers pioneering the

597
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,600
fabrications of living tissues to makers

598
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,850
looking to transfer

599
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,230
homes and workshops and to new and

600
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,600
zanier designs there was room for

601
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,610
everyone under this big tent so

602
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,230
technology and mainstream media took

603
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,149
note and we're taken with this

604
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,309
storytelling and imagination of these

605
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,929
young mad scientists troublemakers who

606
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,970
are promising to transform the world

607
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,850
through the use of their miraculous if a

608
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,410
bit unassuming looking machines just as

609
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,850
long as you weren't that concerned about

610
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,799
producing parts accurately or

611
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,219
efficiently you were all set full speed

612
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,590
ahead

613
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,480
for one very important reason the cost

614
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,178
to participate in this activity was

615
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,260
pretty low the machines initially all

616
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:05,210
DIY kits to be assembled and abs and PLA

617
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,610
fabrication materials initially simply

618
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,950
using industrial plastic film it's

619
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,459
designed for other fields we're cheap as

620
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,500
well the field was addictive so very few

621
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,059
got out of these machines precisely the

622
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,190
funds and resources they put into them

623
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,280
but with the technology evolving so

624
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,900
rapidly simply keeping up with what was

625
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,940
happening in this lively area and

626
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,610
contributing what you could do as you

627
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,390
did so with seen as a worthy goal to

628
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,889
keep the hobby slash addiction going

629
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,429
welcome to the first faltering steps of

630
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:39,559
the 3d printing desktop revolution ok so

631
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:45,860
now I'm going to leap forward a few

632
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:47,510
years over the early childhood of

633
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,490
desktop 3d printing movement to 2012

634
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,140
this is when the machines became precise

635
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,030
and reliable enough and the market

636
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,830
receptive enough that the world truly

637
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,990
began to take notice of desktop 3d

638
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,149
printing like to address one of the

639
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,270
desktop 3d printing key early topics as

640
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,830
a significant indicator to the role the

641
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,049
media played in popularizing this

642
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,629
technology while also being its Achilles

643
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,668
heel this was the promise of imminent

644
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,549
mass consumer adoption of this

645
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,320
technology starting in 2012 the

646
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,020
mainstream media struck up a long

647
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,418
flirtation with what had been until then

648
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,240
largely a tool of Industry and a dream

649
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,919
of science fiction when their while

650
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,419
their enthusiasm was contagious and

651
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,610
probably attracted many of the young

652
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,200
innovators and venture capitalists into

653
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,750
a niche area they might have overlooked

654
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,210
otherwise several of these messages were

655
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,400
misleading now here is an opportunity

656
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,720
for me to disclose my role in

657
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,280
participating in these companies and

658
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,440
marketing strategies

659
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,930
because this technology was new to many

660
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,880
of the journalists wanting to cover it

661
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:49,550
many more of the terms and statements

662
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,560
repeated in articles and interviews have

663
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,750
a more direct origin in the marketing

664
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,340
departments of the young desktop 3d

665
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,680
printing companies then would be

666
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,080
typically okay in other areas of

667
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,640
reporting this isn't necessarily the

668
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,010
printer manufacturers fault entirely

669
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,810
hopefully we can be granted some leeway

670
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,210
for making efforts to build out these

671
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,580
businesses and find new customers and it

672
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,350
probably sounded very good to us the

673
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,860
prospect of customers in every household

674
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:18,290
on the planet well we were inventing new

675
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,570
approaches to branding and promoting the

676
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,090
underlying concepts around 3d printing

677
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,129
and it was a lucky thing too we came up

678
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,560
with ideas that had enough staying power

679
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,650
to take root in popular imagination even

680
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,540
today for example Keith Ozar and Bre

681
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,550
Pettis from MakerBot drew on backgrounds

682
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,440
and entertainment music and film and

683
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,240
we're not afraid to champion images from

684
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,280
pop culture and science fiction that

685
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,380
were well suited to expression over the

686
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,180
Internet a big switch from the

687
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,370
enterprise friendly industrial video

688
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,780
style presented by additive technology

689
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,780
companies before them

690
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,550
so how branded marketing works in

691
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,500
desktop 3d printing is a key

692
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,409
differentiator between what had

693
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,490
previously felt industry centric

694
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,290
inaccessible when compared with the

695
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,420
whimsical inventive high-energy

696
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,210
bleeding-edge associations to public as

697
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,760
with desktop and many of the longer

698
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,950
standing popularly held confusions came

699
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,420
from a very good place the passions and

700
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,310
dreams of those of us who approached

701
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,620
desktop 3d printing as a mission as a

702
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,050
revolution we saw this technology as the

703
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,600
opportunity to reshape our civilization

704
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,310
and commerce itself and with this vision

705
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,290
in mind we wanted the gospel of desktop

706
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,060
3d printing to spread to every corner of

707
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:30,320
the globe that's a pretty romantic

708
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:33,080
notion right so this forecast largely

709
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,790
has not come to pass what's more there

710
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,740
are compelling arguments that the

711
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,899
technology hasn't yet uncovered a

712
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,270
compelling enough reason to drive mass

713
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,920
adoption while the technology finds its

714
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,650
way into more and more fields and

715
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,470
occupations there does still seem to be

716
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,060
that prerequisite for ownership that 3d

717
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,610
customers are those who already have a

718
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,050
need for a tool capable of making

719
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,080
digital designs into physic

720
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,879
objects so designers makers crafters

721
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,699
artists inventors students educators

722
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,190
engineers architects doctors dentists

723
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,830
all of these folks they purchased their

724
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,990
own home units and they go to town so

725
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,970
while a sizable group not every shopper

726
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,970
will fall under 3d printing spell not

727
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:17,600
yet but as the media height around this

728
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,160
particular message fades away it is too

729
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,959
early to dismiss a bright future for

730
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,460
this technology don't overlook the fact

731
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,810
that there are actually more interesting

732
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,420
and mind-bending things happening in

733
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,700
this field now than at the peak of the

734
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,460
popular interest in the technology so

735
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,090
now let's take a brief look at the rise

736
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,640
and fall as soon I would be done with my

737
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,470
numbers so now let's take a brief look

738
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,040
at the rise and fall of the desktop 3d

739
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:45,140
printer revolution 2012 to 2014 from

740
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,360
here we can finally shift from talking

741
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,350
about the anticipated future of desktop

742
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,139
3d printing over to where we ended up so

743
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,840
this period had some very high peaks

744
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,030
President Obama stating that 3d printing

745
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,669
is a future in his 2013 stay the Union

748
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,650
entire 3d printer village the launch of

749

752

754
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,190
formlabs as notable highlights and as

755
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,570
sad news if you guys haven't noticed

756
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,670
printer bot has just closed doors which

757
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,020
is very sad I was very tempted to do an

758
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,710
in memoriam and I thought that would

759
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,200
might be a little too grim for this but

760
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,940
there's been some great early

761
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,270
contributors I've mentioned before that

762
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,860
are no longer doing as much so speaking

763
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,650
of which ultimate current peers like

764
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,540
type-a machines and Alif objects began

765
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,490
shipping reliable pre-built machines not

766
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,100
only to their original geographic areas

767
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,260
but to customers worldwide the enable

768
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,000
movement sought to unite these squadrons

769
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,070
and squadrons of individual desktop 3d

770
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,590
printer operators to put their machines

771
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,870
to the use for a humanitarian effort and

772
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,459
help those in need of assistive devices

773
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:08,059
and open prosthetics research so desktop

774

776
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:13,399
replicator 2 on the cover of Wired

777
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:15,859
magazine was acquired by

778
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:18,258
stratasys for a hundred million dollars

779
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:19,908
Fanning the flames of additive

manufacturing investment within the

781
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:24,320
industrial space as well as the desktop

782
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:26,928
space so everything was on its way up

783
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,789
and up right

784
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,070
Josiah Curiosity have any of you've seen

785
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,889
the Netflix documentary print the legend

786
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:37,820
if you haven't there's some interesting

787
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:39,889
stories you can see about this time so

788
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,678
is everyone going to be getting on that

789
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:45,289
rocket ship and blasting off into space

790
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,239
ok spoiler that's not what happened

791
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:48,919
there's the off side case of MakerBot

792
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:50,719
you know spread to hit their target

793
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,239
numbers for the earn-out associated with

794
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:54,679
the stratasys acquisition stumbling

795
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,359
pretty badly launching products that

796
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,059
weren't ready for market other companies

797
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:01,129
like 3d systems announcing dozens of

798
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,499
innovative new products to address the

799
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:05,928
consumer space at CES

800
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:08,629
none of which ever reached the market at

801
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,789
all and while some of the best steps

802
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:12,949
forward for the technology in this field

803
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:14,929
actually took place during this time

804
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,779
period I'm talking about the precipitous

805
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:21,469
rise and drop of stock valuations and

806
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:23,809
and more left many of those with bright

807
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:25,789
eyes and earnest dreams of the early

808
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,499
days of desktop in a pretty dark and

809
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,908
disillusion space and that was

810
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:33,950
definitely me for a while so despite the

811
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:36,349
tarnish on its reputation that

812
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:39,320
inevitably follows the collapse of such

813
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:41,869
impossible hype 3d printing managed to

814
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,928
get back on its feet if heat does itself

815
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:51,769
off and get to work transforming design

816
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:54,169
engineering and manufacturing so while

817
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:56,299
the news outlets might have shifted to

818
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:58,129
focus on other topics and investors have

819
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,469
shifted away from anticipating 10 X

820
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:04,099
multipliers in consumer basic strategies

821
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:05,839
in the field of desktop 3d printing the

822
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:07,668
field is actually still growing and

823
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,070
getting stronger and playing a bigger

824
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,710
role in our world so desktop 3d printing

825
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,539
is now more heavily in use in more

826
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,059
professional and academic context than

827
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:19,129
ever before young employees being hired

828
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:21,168
right out of school at architecture and

829
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,679
engineering firms are expected to have

830
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:23,630
base

831
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Desktop 3d printing experience already

832
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,510
under their belts and what's more of

833
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,870
this technology

834
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,120
what's once undervalued as a stepchild

835
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:35,689
of additive manufacturing is now on its

836
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,000
way to be adopted at more stages of the

837
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,790
product design manufacturing production

838
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,340
and in medical context than ever

839
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,590
anticipated it's starting even to push

840
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,949
out higher cost industrial machines in

841
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:51,080
many contexts why buy a high cost hero

842
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,210
machine from the industrial space when

843
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,220
you can purchase an entire room full of

844
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,380
accurate reliable modular and

845
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:01,730
inexpensive machines to operate

846
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:04,580
professional desktop equipment the

847
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,230
assumption used to be that the new and

848
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,689
cheaper technology was just a lower

849
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,850
grade version of rapid prototyping and

850
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,350
additive manufacturing not necessarily

851
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,360
even worth the hassle when getting

852
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,760
serious work done so I'm gonna switch

853
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,469
modes a little bit and speak with about

854
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,870
what I'm seeing experiencing right now

855
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,300
from within the Ultimaker ecosystem I

856
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,979
believe based on research and friendiy

857
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,320
friendly relationships with folks at

858
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,750
other pier desktop 3d printer companies

859
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,750
that this kinds of trend that I'm gonna

860
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,990
share details about as I leave my number

861
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,420
slides and actually show you some things

862
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,280
is similar to what is happening with

863
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,310
some of the other professional desktop

864
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,620
solutions and so is speaking to what's

865
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,320
happening this field so I hope you'll

866
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:52,159
indulge me to share my personal field

867
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,870
reports from this evolving story one of

868
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,600
the more exciting aspects of the

869
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,669
revolution are sort of the evolution of

870
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,560
the role of desktop 3d printing and

871
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,950
professional design engineering and

872
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,230
manufacturing processes are the new ways

873
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,690
that this accessible low-cost technology

874
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,139
is being adopted in creative processes

875
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,880
and in problem solving 3d printer and

876
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,879
additive manufacturing tools have long

877
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,980
been assigned roles in prototyping the

878
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,140
first primary use and the initial label

879
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,600
assigned to this technology was rapid

880
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,549
prototyping after all in over the past

881
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,469
eight years the field of additive

882
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,960
manufacturing for custom parts and low

883
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,668
volume production has shifted from an

884
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,860
idea that might work to what design

885
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:35,900
firms depend on every week to keep pace

886
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,650
with product development

887
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,520
now the tables have turned in 2015 and

888
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,620
2016

889
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,020
professional desktop machines like the

890
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,719
Ultimaker and some of our peers reached

891
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,909
parity for resolution quality of parts

892
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:53,029
range of materials and other features

893
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,759
with many of their of the more expensive

894
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,480
industrial 3d printing cousins now don't

895
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,450
get me wrong

896
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,980
industrial additive technology OEMs did

897
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,169
not rest on their laurels some

898
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,180
innovative players in the industrial

899
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,400
space have been constantly pushing the

900
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,470
higher end of the am higher and higher

901
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,630
delivering new and amazing impossible

902
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:15,259
parts from functional human trial

903
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,760
kidneys and skull plates 240 prints that

904
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,280
propel themselves off the build plate

905
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,620
when fabrication is completed to semi

906
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,220
affordable metal 3d printing processes

907
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,650
such as desktop metal formlabs 10k sls

908
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:31,189
machine and carbons high speed SLA

909
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:34,790
process but here is one of the first key

910
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:38,240
insights it is modest it has definitely

911
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:40,660
left less sexy than saying this machine

912
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,250
is revolutionary and disrupts industries

913
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,940
but here is the first evidence that this

914
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,800
disruption is actually taking place

915
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,500
engineers innovators and designers have

916
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,170
come to realize that in most cases they

917
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:57,110
actually don't need anything more fancy

918
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,510
or higher cost than say an Ultimaker

919
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:01,400
printed part for most of the stages of

920
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,350
design development this doesn't mean

921
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,300
that they don't like the look of a part

922
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,759
hundreds of dollars or thousands of

923
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,130
dollars more off a Fortis or an objet

924
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,990
but what it means is that they can

925
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,930
actually accomplish everything they need

926
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:18,189
to do to make their designs better to

927
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,080
communicate internally and with clients

928
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,960
with in the professional desktop 3d

929
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,270
printing world so as the cost to produce

930
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,370
parts using these desktop technologies

931
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,920
continue to plummet towards what is

932
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,900
perceived as practically free these

933
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,390
creators are finding other opportunities

934
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,370
to take advantage of this ability to

935
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,069
produce sturdy functional printed parts

936
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:42,799
in a range materials and as more and

937
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,810
more workflows are driven by digital

938
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,880
design these days there are more

939
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,900
opportunities and very little effort to

940
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,110
use desktop 3d printers to produce

941
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,550
parts studies sketch models and jigs far

942
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,600
earlier and during more stages

943
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,720
throughout the design development

944
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,870
process than anticipated so I've been

945
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,970
working closely with the 10x beta team

946
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,130
over at new lab and their their

947
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,680
fast-paced hardware design firm whose

948
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,850
staff have been using 3d printing since

949
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,980
before the technology was actually

950
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,700
commercialized so they've been in the 3d

951
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,920
space for a very long time and CEO

952
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,839
Marcel Botha said a few things I thought

953
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,810
was interesting that reinforced this

954
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:26,070
shift said 3d printer manufacturers in

955
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,799
desktop have reached the inflection

956
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,960
point where these desktop units are

957
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,300
perfectly sized to fabricate relevant

958
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,920
size objects and the resolution is

959
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,920
superior the machines that cost many

960
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,710
multiples more and he also said even

961
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,230
more crucially the industrial additive

962
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:46,140
manufacturing companies missed the point

963
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:49,110
as far as providing what is critical for

964
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,700
prototyping with with our machines we

965
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,920
can finally use 3d printers for

966
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,569
experimentation on the fly the original

967
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,480
aim of iterating and rapid prototyping

968
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,700
was at the net at the end of the day to

969
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,820
prototype and not to produce costly

970
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,950
artifacts at each stage in other words

971
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,660
while the industrial 3d printer

972
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,700
companies continue to advocate for a

973
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,190
leading position based on costly

974
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,290
challenging capabilities the clients

975
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,990
themselves realized that to accelerate

976
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,779
their design processes they really just

977
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:21,359
needed on-site easy access desktop 3d

978
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,550
printing most of what they need is a

979
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,380
glance at poke get and pass around a

980
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:29,070
printed part and then chuck it in the

981
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,830
trash and having a tool like ours and a

982
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,860
lot of our peers that keeps the cost per

983
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:37,319
print low strongly reinforces this kind

984
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,900
of behavior and makes printing a natural

985
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:46,920
and reflexive part of the digital design

986
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:50,550
process so now so I want to share a

987
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,770
little bit of the sort of new landscape

988
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,430
of desktop 3d printing and share some

989
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:58,980
examples of some things I've been seeing

990
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:01,080
so we sort of had identified these five

991
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,640
areas in the professional world as being

992
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,910
the places that desktop there

993
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,790
printing is completely ready to to you

994
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,740
know move full-speed so product

995
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,080
development which won't surprise you a

996
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,149
lot of prototyping is there but also

997
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:19,380
manufacturing aids in use parts

998
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:22,530
architecture medical desktop 3d printing

999
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,940
has long been a huge ally for education

1000
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,380
and we'll talk about that too

1001
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,350
but I want to go through a couple of

1002
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,650
these and in more specifics okay so

1003
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:33,420
product development so we're kind of

1004
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,020
splitting this out in terms of these

1005
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,910
four areas so concept direction some of

1006
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,090
the early stages of you know figuring

1007
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,850
out what the problem is now it might not

1008
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:48,240
seem like an exciting thing but in the

1009
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,670
past to produce the CAD to make the part

1010
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,729
to use this kind of technology for this

1011
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,950
it really wasn't indicated but now with

1012
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,170
people being much more comfortable using

1013
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,240
digital design tools and the digital

1014
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,940
design tools themselves being you know

1015
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,560
better you know matched into the the

1016
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,200
context where they can get things out to

1017
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,020
3d print them you're seeing new kinds of

1018
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,569
behaviors and this doesn't work if

1019
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:17,580
you're having to fill out a Pio every

1020
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:18,240
time you print an object so concept

1021
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,310
directions

1022
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,729
shape and form you have an object that

1023
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:25,080
can that you can print things that are

1024
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,150
strong enough that you can really test

1025
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,660
them up against other objects you can

1026
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:33,210
test interface you can you can cast and

1027
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,819
mold from it it's a great tool for that

1028
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:39,570
and then the classic split for

1029
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,310
prototyping looks like works like you

1030
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,860
can actually take both areas further

1031
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:46,490
than a lot of the other technologies and

1032
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,690
one of the key things and reasons why is

1033
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:52,169
you're putting all the actual

1034
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:54,600
information into the digital design a 3d

1035
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:58,680
printed part is less real than a digital

1036
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,420
design it's a it's a state and and if

1037
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,649
you do this process right

1038
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,360
you're constantly bringing the

1039
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,270
information back into the digital design

1040
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,310
and so when you're looking to make a

1041
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,710
functional prototype you're not spending

1042
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:13,170
a whole lot of time going from you know

1043
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,630
here's my design idea and let's get to

1044
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,530
where we can test it you can constantly

1045
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,870
tune in

1046
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,940
week in the on the digital side and get

1047
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:24,270
that instant feedback as you bring it

1048
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:27,030
into the tangible world same with with

1049
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,710
looks like prototyping you can do more

1050
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,230
things to these shapes you have that

1051
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,790
physical shape and it can you know be

1052
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,700
handled and experienced like the real

1053
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,529
thing so I want to show a couple of

1054
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,259
projects that people have been doing I'd

1055
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:43,440
mentioned to next beta and here a couple

1056
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,660
of models for a project you know I

1057
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,970
actually switch down to it the dart

1058
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,759
metrics so they've been doing a couple

1059
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:54,600
of fitness training robots they did one

1060
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:59,040
with Puma that was designed to be able

1061
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,569
to give usain bolt a challenge on the on

1062
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,790
the track it's pretty pretty insane

1063
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,400
project so they decided to make one that

1064
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:09,930
would be suitable to NFL training so

1065
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,060
this is a robot that is monitoring the

1066
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,370
person who is following that following

1067
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,640
them and is capable of keeping up and

1068
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,830
exceeding the performance of you know

1069
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,549
pretty impressive athletes to really

1070
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:24,960
give them a challenge and allow you know

1071
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,030
be grabbing data the whole time to

1072
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,150
really understand what elements can be

1073
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,130
improved you know what the what the

1074
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,080
athletes skills are that kind of thing

1075
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:39,120
so in these images here so they started

1076
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:42,950
printing some early concepts to get like

1077
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,720
a sense of what it would be like cool

1078
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,069
yeah what it would be like to you know

1079
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,169
what the concept should look like how it

1080
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,130
might function and what is really

1081
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,420
interesting to me they went through a

1082
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,100
long process and they found some

1083
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,690
identified some really useful things to

1084
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,700
them in their communication with their

1085
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,590
clients but then when they went to do

1086
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,270
mock-ups they found that they had a

1087
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,920
little bit of a problem that some of

1088
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,680
these concepts they just couldn't turn

1089
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,390
fast enough they would topple and so

1090
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,000
they started really rethinking that the

1091
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,500
project at that point changing the

1092
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,570
materials that kind of thing well they

1093
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,760
had the cat because they had developed

1094
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,890
it in working through all these designs

1095
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,210
so they end up using 3d printing not for

1096
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,509
the outer surface it's not the outer

1097
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,280
facing of these objects but to for all

1098
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,020
the brackets and stuff to be able to

1099
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,850
make this thing quickly so they could

1100
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,350
mock it up and test it and we're gonna

1101
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,540
you know get it all the way to really

1102
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,250
solving that problem here's another

1103
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,160
little project they've just got some

1104
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:37,740
attention recently they did a lot of the

1105
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,670
engineering and electronics side of this

1106
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:45,359
so so this is a project that is to help

1107
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:47,220
monitor patients and in our early rounds

1108
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,170
in hospitals and they had a very

1109
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,580
specific constraint of where they could

1110
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,710
put it and they had to get a lot of

1111
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,630
sensors and information into it and the

1112
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,940
experience of it socially had to feel

1113
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,130
not like some surveillance thing but

1114
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,110
something that would be pleasant to

1115
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,480
receive and experience because you need

1116
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,240
adoption from the nurses as well as the

1117
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,770
patients and and everybody so what's

1118
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,029
interesting about this is as they were

1119
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,400
developing it and printing out

1120
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,380
enclosures they were able to accommodate

1121
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,200
using off-the-shelf development

1122
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,660
electronics and constantly be changing

1123
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,629
how they were including the elements

1124
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,629
while putting it into a pertinent sized

1125
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,060
frame to give feedback so they kept

1126
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:29,520
tuning and tweaking how it behaved

1127
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:33,029
internally as a miniaturize electronics

1128
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,460
and finally committed to things so

1129
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,800
manufacturing AIDS is an area we didn't

1130
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:42,300
actually expect to be but one that is

1131
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:45,990
huge so while a lot of manufacturers are

1132
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,900
using our kinds of stuff to make handy

1133
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:52,020
jigs and fixtures in general we're also

1134
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:56,100
seeing things like install a it's like

1135
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:59,970
this story from Volkswagen which I'll

1136
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:01,980
share here so in in Portugal there the

1137
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,509
team there has a whole room full of 3d

1138
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,820
printers and they're using it to make

1139
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,890
all the Handy tools for installing parts

1140
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,620
of the car and it's it's not that these

1141
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:12,600
parts are so precious it's that they're

1142
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,779
heavy use they get destroyed really fast

1143
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,250
and and they had been working with

1144
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,460
outside firms have these made and it

1145
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:23,070
gets pretty costly pretty fast so by

1146
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,690
bringing it in-house light not only were

1147
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,510
able to save money to produce these

1148
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,340
things at minimum cost but they were

1149
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:33,030
able to refine them tune them tweak them

1150
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:36,660
and use them in the process of really

1151
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,800
changing how the how they're they're

1152
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:43,230
used and how the onboarding process

1153
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:45,560
happened production and in use parts

1154
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:48,900
just briefly mentioned two stories here

1155
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,299
so one is actually jump down here to

1156
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,130
farm shelf so farm shelf does a desktop

1157
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,210
size and we had like a like a bookshelf

1158
00:45:53,130 --> 00:46:01,109
size hydroponics rig 250-300 custom

1159
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:03,420
parts they had to develop a modular set

1160
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:05,279
and iterate that entire modular set and

1161
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,960
there was no funding route that they

1162
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,090
could they could pay to make those

1163
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,109
custom parts while they were still

1164
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,240
identifying what would be the right

1165
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:16,020
solution so they were able to integrate

1166
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,540
the entire 350 custom parts like 11

1167
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,050
times without ever committing to tooling

1168
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:25,160
or rejection molding so I definitely

1169
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,720
running out of time so I'm going to

1170
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,060
invite anyone who's interested

1171
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,310
afterwards definitely connect with me I

1172
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,619
want to to talk to you I can share some

1173
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,509
of these other stories but I want to

1174
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,960
mention one last story in my last like

1175
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,220
30 seconds here in architecture so 3d

1176
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,369
printing has been part of the

1177
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,680
architecture story for a very long time

1178
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:55,560
but what is interesting is we're seeing

1179
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:57,089
firms like KPMG the you know situation

1180
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,080
where you're submitting a part and

1181
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,000
somebody's running it hand it back to

1182
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,940
you and putting it back within the

1183
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,630
direct access of architects and

1184
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,910
designers and by having their own access

1185
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,590
and able and being able to iterate when

1186
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,140
they want as they want and communicate

1187
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,730
internally before filling out POS and

1188
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,830
really you know committing to costly

1189
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,930
processes they're accelerating what

1190
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,970
they're doing so this you know even

1191
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:24,779
though doesn't seem like a very fancy

1192
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:30,720
use this is incredibly accelerating

1193
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:32,850
their vast and distributed team of cost

1194
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,950
seven sites okay so I should probably

1195
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,400
wrap up but thank you all very much for

1196
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:45,819
coming

1197
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:45,820
[Applause]
