1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
they're trying to get up to the help say

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,390
easy floor got the 16 and a Taurus gotta

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,039
press 16 and went all the way down and

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,200
then we came back over to second trip

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,540
more boxes on the third floor people got

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,739
out in the elevator moved halfway and it

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,590
happened again eighth floor is

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,740
terrifying and they're not getting a

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,840
good review on Yelp my name is Evan

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,359
thank you for being here I can't see any

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,570
of you so I assume we're there her noise

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:35,329
notches on my head so I'm going to talk

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:38,329
about Lego robotics of the 1980s okay

14
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,329
okay

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,739
what am I talking about

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,329
okay so everyone knows Mindstorms the

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,530
modern legal robots kits and a third

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,710
generation started in 98 so Who am I and

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,039
why do I care I will try my best to

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,210
explain that and that's a couple slides

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,910
this was supposed to be one at a time

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,979
that didn't work so they worked this

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,470
morning anyway

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,479
I try not to do PowerPoint karaoke but I

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,979
failed business one at a time so I've

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,179
been a lego fan since I was a you know

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,740
this tall so to speak

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,080
fifth grade saw my first computer ever

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,179
oh I had a homeless Atari video games we

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,619
learned logo we didn't learn real logo

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,770
full-fledged programming language we

32
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,700
learn

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,869
turno graphics and I don't know if any

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,640
of you've used logo but it is a

35
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,860
full-fledged programming language no one

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,570
in her right mind as an adult uses logo

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,270
for anything except teaching children

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,350
turnover ethics it's again I hate to

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,360
make you read the slide you're supposed

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,798
to one at a time

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,990
basic blah blah the only redeeming

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,700
quality of having religion in my life as

43
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,740
a child was getting an apple to Muhammad

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,509
SAW so I consciously remember like it

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,130
was today and I'm not making his up I

46
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,979
remember it like it just happened this

47
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,719
morning being 12 years old tell him I

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,000
telling my parents I wish there was a

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,600
way to connect my apple 2e to my Legos

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,899
and that was 1986 and it turned out that

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,359
year this thing came out but no one knew

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,680
about it it was only sold to schools and

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,159
so we had no way of knowing about it

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,140
however my mom was an important person

55
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,060
in the local school district so I almost

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,399
feel as if anyone should have known it

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,560
should have been me right but it was not

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,689
to be until 30 years later and I'll get

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,849
to that in a couple slides and then my

60
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:34,680
life took a different course it wasn't

61
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:37,500
interested in computers anymore okay

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,420
that's one okay so around 2002 in as a

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,719
somewhat adult started thinking about

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,738
nostalgia a little bit old computers I'm

65
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,319
an open source guy in 2004 I co-founded

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,239
a club just a club called March it was

67
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,298
mid-atlantic retrocomputing hobbyist

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,340
just like you know collector's group for

69
00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:02,609
a few states around and that was pretty

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,769
successful we closed March in 2015 form

71
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:08,010
a new group vintage computer Federation

72
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,919
which is a proper 501c3 nonprofit and

73
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,899
that's a national organization and the

74
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,340
first thing it did was form a mimetic

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,260
chapter to supersede the ol March and by

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,790
the way I seem to have lost my social

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,590
media slide we were at VC Federation as

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,198
our social media so if you want to take

79
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,720
us there anything from his talk blah

80
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,250
blah blah and I you know I remember as a

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,049
child one day I was like in second or

82
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,970
third grade and the kid down the street

83
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,139
his mom brought him over to play and my

84
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,519
mom said come out of your room you know

85
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,389
go outside I'm like but I'm playing with

86
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,759
Legos and I'm kind of still that way

87
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:47,849
some things never change

88
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,790
okay so here's how it this all started

89
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,379
legal thing so we do we have our own

90
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,798
event series called a vintage computer

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,018
festival and we do road shows events

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,400
like this and it got to be we star doing

93
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,319
too many road shows to come up with

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,549
unique ideas or all of them so we

95
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,159
started looking for ways a couple years

96
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,109
ago to sort of recycle ideas and in 2016

97
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,608
one of my colleagues Jeff said let's do

98
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:15,449
a you know robot demo vintage give you a

99
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:18,359
robot demo okay fine so we were on our

100
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,949
email list for our chapter and saying

101
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,478
hey you know anyone have a cool robot we

102
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,240
had like a Keith Kid hero and someone

103
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,469
had a arm for an M Sai and somebody said

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,510
I have this Lego kit and I'll make you

105
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:29,090
out for what

106
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,340
you know what do you mean what Lego kit

107
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,510
and he showed me and I said Oh oMFG

108
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,539
right now there's children in the

109
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,510
audience I was like this is amazing this

110
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,850
is what I wanted it for two years ago

111
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,680
and he had a new him box literally new

112
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,660
in box never opened kit and 30 years ago

113
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,980
I I got to open and unbox it it was

114
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,700
incredible I should have done a video I

115
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:54,320
didn't know that was a thing then anyway

116
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:57,080
so that same summer I run marathons so I

117
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,180
do to stress out the D stress and that

118
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,880
summer I had some knee pain from running

119
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,380
my second marathon went to the doctor

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,790
x-ray MRI they said it good news is just

121
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,219
runner's knee you get some PT you'd be

122
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,770
fine the bad news is we found a spot I

123
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,590
her femur in the x-ray and there was a

124
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,710
long history of my family of you dying

125
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,109
of cancer so when I got something at 41

126
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm like not me right

127
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,760
at this so I couldn't run for a year

128
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,229
which is horrible when you tell her

129
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,880
runner you can't run it's like even

130
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,930
worse is that what do you do to

131
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,390
de-stress that that's a thing to take

132
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,910
away right so I had to stay home

133
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,469
couldn't worked for a few months and I

134
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,480
had nothing to do have a play with this

135
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,800
thing and learn how to use any program

136
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,630
it so I was it was good medicine I was

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,360
an English major don't hold it against

138
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,840
me thank you

139
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,240
one liberal arts person in the room in

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,030
pure technical engineering IT dev

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,940
aptitude most of you probably know more

142
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,400
than I ever will but I spent the last

143
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,469
two years immersed in this thing so I'm

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,760
going to inform you about it some of the

145
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,530
code I show you may seem like

146
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,010
ridiculously simple I learned to say 8th

147
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,570
grade

148
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,490
yes well I stopped taking computers in

149
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,920
seventh grade so for me it was a new

150
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,820
thing so please understand where I'm

151
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,350
coming from if you were to google for

152
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,050
history Lego robotics you'll find no

153
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,090
love for it everything you'll find is

154
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,370
about Mindstorms like as if these set

155
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,989
don't exist I made up this word on Vic

156
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,030
with us that is something that is

157
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,980
everywhere and nowhere at once and what

158
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,630
I mean by that is you'll find individual

159
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,700
things here and there all over the

160
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,310
internet about little individual parts

161
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,780
of the kit but there's no one place and

162
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,050
I'm working on that I'll talk about that

163
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,049
a little later

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,980
the top half of this slide is from Leo

165
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,340
calm the bottom half some Wikipedia and

166
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,400
as you see the 1986 okay first KITT

167
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,590
reduce great and then we started working

168
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,280
in my team it was Mindstorms what they

169
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,640
skip over all their history and shame on

170
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,869
you leggo and of course Wikipedia it's

171
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,690
you know the old Wikipedia it must be

172
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:09,630
true great assault right okay so there

173
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:14,370
were actually five Lego robotics sets

174
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:17,219
before Mindstorms this one which is the

175
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,020
one I talked about that one that one

176
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,540
that one and that one the ones with the

177
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,909
9000 series are computer-controlled for

178
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,770
example the one in 93 there's like

179
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,890
software for Windows 95 and you know

180
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,240
it's boss you know Windows I don't own

181
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,320
that kit I never had chance to play with

182
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,010
it

183
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,190
the other ones well at the 1990 and the

184
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,870
the first 97 one they give you a little

185
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,760
interface box but you program it right

186
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,080
from the box so you literally have this

187
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,060
plastic box attached to your robot

188
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,770
there's no computer involved and you

189
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,110
just press the buttons on a box and it's

190
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,620
like macros if you press left forward

191
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,450
you know stop it goes left forward stop

192
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,640
the 97 one is this weird thing using

193
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,020
barcode scanners it's very strong I

194
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,760
haven't only one actually own is the

195
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,770
first one and that's the one that's the

196
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:09,450
cool one in my opinion because I'm a

197
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:14,969
vintage computer nerd so that's today's

198
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:17,270
focus if you google for information

199
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,000
about this one thing you might find is

200
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,609
does anyone know what Kansas festus and

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,620
we heard of Kansas vest no Kansas best

202
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,140
is an annual conference it's actually

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,910
this week or last week every year in

204
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,098
July in Kansas City it's an apple to

205
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,000
conference it's been going on for 41

206
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,830
years now and one thing you'll find to

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
Google is my talk from last year's

208
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,760
Kansas vest and you'll find article and

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,700
I Triple E spectrum that my colleague

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,200
and I wrote about this kit two years ago

211
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,790
they're kind of deprecated because we

212
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,060
now know a lot more about it than we did

213
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,250
then for example at the time we referred

214
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,319
to it as Lego

215
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,360
see logo turns out that was just the

216
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,010
name of one piece of software I miss I

217
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,530
incorrectly thought that was the kit

218
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,290
name I now know the proper kit name is

219
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,140
9700 technic Control Center so if you

220
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:11,780
cease to see a call Lego logo TC thing

221
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,699
that's deprecated information okay so

222
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,800
with the kit you get an interface box

223
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,680
that goes between your model and your

224
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,089
computer for volton orders they're

225
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,189
interesting because the modern mind

226
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,160
swims with motors are like RC car motors

227
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,770
they're fast and strong you got four

228
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,280
they said 4.5 but my assault my

229
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:34,100
multimeter also 84 volts these little

230
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,860
you get touch sensors you get to touch

231
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,510
sensors one optical sensor a couple

232
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,900
little legal LEDs and of course you get

233
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,790
Legos the Lego fan boys are militant

234
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,900
that it's full o of Legos Lego and that

235
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:50,089
unless he's filled in all uppercase

236
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:52,610
letters they're kind of nuts in fact on

237
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,280
the lego.com site there's a page about

238
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,950
fair use how you may or may not write

239
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,900
Lego it's absolutely nuts

240
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,670
and they even sent me like a season to

241
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,650
say that crazy alright so they made this

242
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,689
kit for various computers of the period

243
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,120
in Europe but there was a BBC micro

244
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,650
version and a core version in the US the

245
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,770
most popular versions for the Apple 2 in

246
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,780
the IBM PC supposedly there was a

247
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:22,460
commodore version i've never seen it in

248
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,500
person maybe an MSX version the reason I

249
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,970
put the X is there next to the computer

250
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,770
names is you can use them with anything

251
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:37,010
that's compatible so I'll talk about

252
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:40,579
that more in a minute ok a laser 128 so

253
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:43,600
his company called laser they were they

254
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,920
made illegal clones at Apple 2 computers

255
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,580
specifically they made a clone with the

256
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,620
Apple 2 C which is a small portable one

257
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,270
but a 2 seed I wanted to take a to see

258
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,980
instead of a full-size Apple 2 because

259
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,870
it's small important his disk drive

260
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,370
built in less to carry but A to C

261
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,800
doesn't have a card slot what you need

262
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,680
so the laser does so I took one of those

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,899
and it's compatible enough to do the

264
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,300
demo

265
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,269
compact portable three is a 286 computer

266
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,729
286 little suitcase computer that's an

267
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:17,279
IBM PC clone again all-in-one a lot

268
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,279
easier in schlepping a full-size IBM PC

269
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,859
that's a laser 128 so it's hard to tell

270
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,929
from the top view but on the right side

271
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,540
is a floppy like a real to see on the

272
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:31,029
left side is a card slot that's a

273
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:35,670
compact portable three not to be

274
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:43,689
confused to contact portable 386 and

275
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:46,628
yeah okay so the card on top I'm sorry

276
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:49,319
this is the Apple card so the one on top

277
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:52,179
is the original Apple card Lego provided

278
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:54,490
we for some reason my friends knew and

279
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,230
box kit had the IBM carb and not the

280
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,389
Apple one and it was sealed like in the

281
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,189
postal mail from 30 years ago so I don't

282
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:02,199
know if Apple Legos screwed up and

283
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,899
didn't put the card in Bazaar but the

284
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,189
schematics are online so systems click

285
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,740
she's part of the network crew here hope

286
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:10,059
good friend of mine he made the card for

287
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,379
me he had a port aboard he makes and

288
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,689
sells so he just made me a card it's

289
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:19,449
awesome 23 chips so if you meet glitch

290
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:22,569
this weekend thank him this is the IBM

291
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:26,050
card it's nothing to see there just a

292
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:27,399
card as you can see the IBM was a little

293
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,160
more complicated the Apple one I don't

294
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,209
know the technical specifics of why see

295
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,790
after mentioned English major somebody

296
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,899
left - thank you okay so on the laser

297
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,969
128 there is a metal enclosure to turn

298
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:47,559
the one slot on the side into two useful

299
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,959
slots and the manual says oops Roman the

300
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,089
manual says okay attach her enclosure

301
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,109
put the cards in it but that enclosure

302
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:58,269
is a unicorn no one has it so my friend

303
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,879
Michael in Australia said you know you

304
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:03,730
should just make it out of Lego like

305
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,279
yeah okay so I did a little velcro dots

306
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,839
on the side to attach it I spaced it out

307
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,509
I left little slot in the back for the

308
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,740
ribbon cable and I sloped the top like

309
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,610
Lego up but a little satellite dish on

310
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,559
it just for fun

311
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,079
and that we were at Maker Faire two

312
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,400
years ago and a little boy nine years

313
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,380
old says has his work

314
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,779
so I dutifully explain to the child if

315
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,040
the data comes out of the satellite dish

316
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,770
bounces off the ceiling and goes to the

317
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,060
robot and a little kid goes oh yeah what

318
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,290
years oh yeah

319
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,579
where's the antenna on the robot in huh

320
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:35,890
I don't like you little brat I was

321
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,390
probably that kid to fight mini-me like

322
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,880
mini-me Evan like Back to the Future he

323
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,100
had a DeLorean you know it was pretty

324
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:47,080
funny it's just decorative there's no

325
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,700
intent this is the compact portable the

326
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,930
the looks like the scaling and the

327
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,610
pictures a little messed up it's not

328
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,079
that tall and skinny definitely not it's

329
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,000
actually quite short and fat so I

330
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,910
apologize for the slide proportions

331
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,560
there the thing on the back is called a

332
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,360
backpack the whole two cards and that

333
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,550
attaches a rare accessory but luckily I

334
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,920
have that and also the the laser has a

335
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,719
joystick port built in the compact you

336
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,099
need a second card for a game port but

337
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,400
locator to card so we have that this is

338
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,779
the top view of the interface box the by

339
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,520
I know you can't see it up air but the

340
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,250
box itself will be on my demo table

341
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,110
later it's about maybe the size of like

342
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,370
you know your arm from your elbow to

343
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:33,339
your hand it's a little plastic box

344
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,720
online they go for anywhere from like 25

345
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,779
bucks untested to a couple hundred

346
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,580
dollars in boxes I got one untested no

347
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,050
power supply got a wall wart plugged it

348
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,880
in open it up tighten things I'm down

349
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,219
tell you things downside it worked fine

350
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,620
it's held together with plastic rivets

351
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,050
six plastic rivets so I just drill those

352
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,330
out popped it open and you know did some

353
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,430
maintains and it worked fine on the

354
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:58,839
right side is where the ribbon cable

355
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,120
connects in the power supply so you see

356
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,750
the red button on the right that's the

357
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,270
stop button emergency stop about that is

358
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,560
an always-on test port for things you

359
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,760
you know you're for testing or for

360
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,089
things you wanted these you know always

361
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:17,920
on like lights whatever ports zero to

362
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:20,370
five control motors and lights ports six

363
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,709
and seven receive input from sensors and

364
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,839
then you can do a B or C for example

365
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,969
port zero to five if you plug in

366
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,160
something there they can motors going on

367
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,170
one direction but if you span a

368
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,300
connector across a B or C

369
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,620
you can use software to flip a motor to

370
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,620
change directions which is very useful

371
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,170
this is the inside of the box the

372
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,000
schematics for this are not outlined but

373
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,069
I know about a hundred people who can

374
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,110
make schematics amiss

375
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,760
so I'll hopefully do that then that's a

376
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,320
couple months make schematics put them

377
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,160
online so anyone can buy one of these

378
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,300
and just make one I have a logic

379
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,889
diaphragm and almost managed diagram so

380
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,849
my friend Dan is an electrical engineer

381
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:09,610
he made this slide dan was going to make

382
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,260
schematics for me and he's he's stage 4

383
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,290
terminal kidney cancer right now he's

384
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:18,310
got a few months left so he's not in

385
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,279
position to make Romantics for me and

386
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,449
I'm very sad about that

387
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:28,540
not about the schematics about my friend

388
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:31,089
Dan okay okay so out of the box

389
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,939
your choices are IBM program and basic

390
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:39,610
which is Microsoft basic or Apple to

391
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:41,860
program and logo experiment number one

392
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,579
IBM basic so at hope here two years ago

393
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,649
I made a little game and I tried to demo

394
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,899
a game and it wasn't really working but

395
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,370
I thought it was kind of working so I

396
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,579
just brought it as is to show on the

397
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,339
demo floor the game was called smoosh

398
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:00,729
softy anyone notice soft iasts and IT

399
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,920
terms it's a Microsoft employee soft

400
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,799
these the game premise of the game I

401
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,629
made this lego streetscape at an angle

402
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,000
facing down so the premise of the game

403
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,040
is that use a software and press the

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,169
button to root opening gate to release a

405
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,599
little Lego car and the car would go

406
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:18,280
gravity down a little angle down the

407
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,409
Lego streetscape and then there's a

408
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,329
little Lego guy and I put like a big

409
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,949
giant piston mechanism under the street

410
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,480
scape so it appeared as if the man was

411
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,850
walking back and crossed across the

412
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,070
street and you had to and the guy was on

413
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,409
a hinge and if if it got if the kiddush

414
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,600
if it tilted over a hinge activate the

415
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,220
optical sensor in you score a point so

416
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,830
the idea was that you had the purpose of

417
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,929
the game was to hit the guy and knock

418
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,100
him over or else he was successfully

419
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,640
across the street into hope and put

420
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,050
Windows 10 your laptop

421
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,270
and it didn't work because the hardware

422
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,430
was fine but the software wasn't working

423
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,379
the problem was Motors was stopped

424
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,770
returning on sensors nothing was turning

425
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,570
off I didn't know why now my friend

426
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,690
glitch I mentioned he's a experienced

427
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,970
electrical engineer his theory no I know

428
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,530
the Lego side not the EE side

429
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,560
he knew the EE side not the Lego side

430
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,750
and Jon's theory was that well I was

431
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,149
using at a time a compact portable 386

432
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,330
running at I don't know four megahertz

433
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,280
whatever was 20 megahertz and the IBM PC

434
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,080
this is made for lens at 1.7 megahertz

435
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,320
so John said oh it's got to be a timing

436
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,899
issue

437
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,429
okay fine Who am I to question him right

438
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,800
we since learned the truth that I'll get

439
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:37,410
to that

440
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:40,649
so Lego provides some sample code can

441
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,230
you all see this okay great okay so this

442
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,690
is the Lego code to initialize the card

443
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,000
everypony right in basic on the IBM

444
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,440
pc/at to initialize a card first the

445
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,160
first thing you notice is they have five

446
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,300
lines of remarks I don't know why that

447
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,680
seems kind of silly robot just bugs on

448
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,780
its own okay sometimes it's possessed

449
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:07,440
the first line I'm sorry line 10,000

450
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:11,070
they're just sets the the slot like the

451
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,290
slot address I don't know what the out

452
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,030
sends data to it I don't know what 21

453
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:20,399
does you'd have to ask a legal engineer

454
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:22,770
for 30 years ago line 100 and line 10020

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,390
does error correction checks to make

456
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,050
sure this is in fact the card in the

457
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:32,090
slot and then you actually to routine

458
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:32,090
you don't really need line 10,000 20

459
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,959
this is the leo Kurd code term bits on

460
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,120
again you have five lines remarks then

461
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,290
it says eleven thousand if you're in you

462
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,540
know make sure you're in a port between

463
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,809
zero and five if you're not you

464
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:49,450
error-correction if you are then proceed

465
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:54,639
now what what eleven thousand twenty

466
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:59,680
does is it converts your port number to

467
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,660
binary to send out the Deportes the coda

468
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,570
turn bits off does the same thing just

469
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,809
just converts opposite in line twelve

470
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,580
thousand twenty this is a code to read

471
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,350
censors again dolt doing the same basic

472
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,449
thing checking the port number do we

473
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,260
know the correction from running decimal

474
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:21,700
to binary very very simple and they have

475
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:24,520
this bizarre code they put in to like a

476
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,830
delay mechanism which is kind of just

477
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:31,120
unnecessary to me there's much better

478
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,470
ways to do delays and then here's the

479
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:39,250
all the error correction error messages

480
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:42,610
and stuff here's my code for the whole

481
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:45,790
thing so you can have about forty or

482
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:51,040
fifty you can have you could have all

483
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:55,450
this on my version which do you like

484
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:58,090
better okay so what I did was first of

485
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,400
all I took out all the pointless five

486
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,159
lines remarks for each thing one line is

487
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,929
plenty and I took out all the error

488
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,020
correction because I know there's a card

489
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:10,540
in my slot and that's all you need

490
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,980
that's all you need now I understand why

491
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,690
they put in all those remarks and error

492
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,730
correction because it's meant for

493
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,550
schoolteachers in twelve volt in 1986

494
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,429
but it turns out the imagination of a 41

495
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,850
year old at a time exceeds that of a 12

496
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:31,200
year old so I said okay this I just do

497
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:33,909
it my way it didn't work it didn't work

498
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,950
the code works fine but as I mentioned

499
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,650
there was a problem with things wouldn't

500
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,290
turn off so two years ago we played ok

501
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,810
timing issue a year and a half passed by

502
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,409
and then a few months ago now that I

503
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:50,659
know much more about it than I did

504
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:52,310
I found a critical typo in Legos code do

505
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,830
an if you see it I challenge any of you

506
00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:00,190
to see the typo

507
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:00,189
shout it out give you a few minutes

508
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:10,720
where's that no no that's not it

509
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:19,129
nope I'll give you a clue it's a number

510
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,790
the the error T and the error in the

511
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,040
code is a number not a letter ah who

512
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:28,070
said that

513
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,139
225 right yes so with that it's a

514
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,540
critical error that has to be 255

515
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,910
because everything is you're 255 in

516
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:40,250
binary

517
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:42,140
there is no plotting you yes I heard you

518
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,950
applause so so yes that it's a critical

519
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,690
error and you could imagine how many

520
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,550
grade school teachers in 1986 are ready

521
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,140
to throw to sing out the window right

522
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,090
went to the principal's got budget for

523
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,910
the kit I don't what a cost for sure was

524
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,649
$700 get this thing it doesn't work you

525
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,470
have a roomful of impatient 12 year olds

526
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:03,320
doesn't work and teacher arias roasting

527
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,760
on the window because it was a typo so

528
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
it was never a timing issue it was a

529
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:11,330
typo when I corrected a typo my original

530
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,190
code for two years ago worked fine so I

531
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,139
I gave I had one of these days I got a

532
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,340
T's John a little bit because he's so

533
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,440
much more knowledgeable to me like wait

534
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:25,429
a minute dude you were wrong anyway so

535
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,560
there was that recent revolution so

536
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,570
anyway after the whole game thing didn't

537
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,950
work I didn't notice at a time so I said

538
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,129
okay forget a game I'm not game

539
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:39,040
developer I'll just make a robot that's

540
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:42,350
my robot it is ugly I am NOT a designer

541
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:46,790
it's a treaded looks like a treaded

542
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,740
forklift missing a few things that are

543
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:53,060
currently on it but it's abets adjust a

544
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:54,800
bit that's a front for you you can see I

545
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,980
wish I had a pointer or laser pointer or

546
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,149
something on the sort of the on the

547
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,320
bottom the actual forth

548
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:02,779
are in the bottom where the things are

549
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,639
sticking out toward like the back you

550
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:06,019
can see a little touch sensor and it's a

551
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:08,269
nerd tench sensor and from the driver

552
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,710
there so when a fork that goes up the

553
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:11,450
touch sensor hits the things sticking

554
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,869
out in the middle and stops it and vice

555
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:19,489
versa when it goes down that's a side

556
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:20,928
view last minute slide someone pointed

557
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:22,849
out to me that rather than to touch

558
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,259
centers and top and bottom I could have

559
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:26,119
to use a single optical sensor in the

560
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:28,190
middle it would have would have worked I

561
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,139
guess but it wouldn't really have saved

562
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,369
me anything in terms of ports because

563
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,658
they use the optical sensor out to put a

564
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,269
light in front of it which takes in a

565
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:43,129
report so it's just a different way of

566
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:45,409
doing it I was at a military vehicle

567
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:47,658
museum and they were showing me some

568
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:50,059
like a duck or a half track or something

569
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:52,070
from row or two and I said oh this house

570
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,678
must have you know big power in it cause

571
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,749
they said no it's an 80 horsepower

572
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,389
six-cylinder motor I said how does a

573
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:03,710
little tiny motor move this 10-ton beast

574
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:06,258
he said gear ratios right real forklifts

575
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,179
are slow and powerful as I mentioned if

576
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:10,129
I had the modern mindstorm stuff one

577
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,999
motor directly to the treads would have

578
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:13,849
worked fine because they're super

579
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:17,029
powerful 9 volts these are 4 volt motors

580
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,799
so magic of math and gear which is you

581
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,169
have opinion to a flywheel to opinion to

582
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:26,239
a flywheel thyra six times and you make

583
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:29,539
torque EMF ya

584
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:31,219
and it's it's fun when you run it and

585
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:32,809
pick it up look at the bottom you can

586
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:34,339
see the first flywheel spinning really

587
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:38,089
fast and each one spins a little slower

588
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:40,399
it's kind of cool Lego heads are all

589
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:44,320
yellow so I took off the head and took a

590
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,320
Sharpie to the neck so it's little steve

591
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:50,239
it's one inch tall i bet you thought he

592
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:56,089
was bigger in real life a little steve

593
00:25:50,239 --> 00:26:02,269
says ways.i ok so experiment number two

594
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:04,428
Apple 2 and logo now if you ever find

595
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,519
your plant yourself in life encounter

596
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,780
with a choice of programming and logo or

597
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,680
listening to Vogon poetry

598
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,970
I implore you choose - Vogon poetry even

599
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,360
if you have to chase it with a pen

600
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,590
classic argot bluster you'll die but

601
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,159
you'll die more pleasantly than

602
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,679
programming and logo I was not so

603
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,320
fortunate I was up to 40 m yesterday

604
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,100
programming in logo there's a reason no

605
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,370
adults ever use this language if

606
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,679
anyone's ever use RP n on a calculator

607
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,550
shout out a keynote our pianist alright

608
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,490
good good

609
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,490
so logos like operands come first it's

610
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,650
it's nutty and it's like I'm used to

611
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,920
basic so instead of subroutines you have

612
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,990
procedures and you're still I mean

613
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,060
ironically you know no languages in a

614
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,200
remind to use line numbers but basic is

615
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,460
what I know so I'm you're staying here

616
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,020
it's a ten and so it's a little bit like

617
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,450
that what is this thing

618
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,450
I lived but it wasn't Pleasant

619
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:09,929
okay this is the Lego logo disk the

620
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,350
first thing you'll notice is that the

621
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:17,130
graphical Legos is upside down I don't

622
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:19,020
know why you'd think somebody I mean

623
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,810
Lego especially eighties was well known

624
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,700
for their quality control you buy a kit

625
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,020
fancy packaging all plastic bags so

626
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,420
everything was nice and pretty inside

627
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:32,250
today not so back then now is reputation

628
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:34,500
so how did it slip I at the Legos are

629
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,370
upside down like someone's like maybe

630
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,410
you have the disk an upside down right

631
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,090
anyway that's bizarre to me I have no

632
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:46,080
explanation for wider upside down drives

633
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:48,090
me nuts space invaders yeah I one day

634
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,129
I'll have to crack it and have to work

635
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,810
with a friend to like disassemble it and

636
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:59,880
disassemble the code and try to fix it

637
00:27:53,810 --> 00:28:01,679
okay so this is the main program that

638
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,460
this is a program believe it or not in

639
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,080
logo two robot do something called

640
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,020
navigate do something called forklift

641
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,710
loop it and that is a valid program and

642
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,450
logo believe it or not navigate and the

643
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,290
forklift are procedures which all about

644
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,660
to show you so to navigate those where I

645
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,309
mentioned RPN like so it says if now

646
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,730
okay so if you ever

647
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:29,850
program an Apple 2 joystick its paddle 0

648
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,970
is the x-axis paddle 1 2 y axis 0 to 255

649
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,490
in each direction pretty simple so if

650
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,649
the if the stick is in the middle you

651
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,700
want the motors to be turned off so you

652
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:45,360
can stop the robot so I say if and these

653
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,809
four conditions then talk to t Theo is

654
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,799
talk to ports a and B and turn them off

655
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:55,918
and then it says if paddle zero is less

656
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,690
than 75 do another sub procedure call

657
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,309
turn left

658
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:05,279
etc etc etc I need a sub procedures to

659
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:06,960
go forward talk to ports a and B put

660
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,299
them in even Direction turn them on and

661
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,840
then instead of return like an basic you

662
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,840
have end back is the same thing although

663
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,759
they go back I also included a command

664
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,889
called tone which is frequency and pitch

665
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,519
because what happens when a truck or

666
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:25,559
forklift goes backward exactly so it

667
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,169
goes which is just thing is that in

668
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,940
basic there's a beep command it just

669
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,320
sounds like a beep and logo you have to

670
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,879
set the frequency in pitch and it sounds

671
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,189
horrible as close as I can get I'm not a

672
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:37,320
music person and then of course to turn

673
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,619
left turn right your turn to treads in

674
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,418
opposite directions so that's why turn

675
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:46,830
one point on even when porn on odd and

676
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,960
do the opposite to turn then there's the

677
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,689
forklift procedure

678
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,549
six and seven are the sensor ones so it

679
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:58,110
says listen to port six if else sensor

680
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,309
talk to port so it says basically it

681
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,629
says listen to the sensor attached to

682
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,549
port six which is one of the touch

683
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:07,049
centers if it's ah if the sensor is on

684
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,110
means islands pressing it then turn the

685
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:13,590
forklift motor off at the center's not

686
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,570
on then continue going down and vice

687
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,879
versa that's how the center's work and

688
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,129
then lift down lift up if you know two

689
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:22,980
buttons are joystick if button zero was

690
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:24,658
held down move the forth motor one way

691
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,499
in the opposite so that's how the

692
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,499
forklift functions

693
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,450
this code looks like it took ten minutes

694
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:38,140
to write and it would if I started

695
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,580
knowing what I know now but I started

696
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,990
from zero and logo and it took a long

697
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,820
time I wrote one of my friends on

698
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,420
Facebook last night everyone of course

699
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,770
logo is legendary for total graphics and

700
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,270
one of my friends on Facebook put a link

701
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,950
on my page last night Saint Heaven I

702
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,420
hear talking about logo here's some high

703
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,670
res total graphics it was a video of

704
00:30:52,420 --> 00:31:03,250
turtles in a zoo kilometer high-res tone

705
00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:05,110
of Rex okay so once I got the logo

706
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,270
side-eye I don't know how I don't know

707
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,169
how proud I should be that I mastered a

708
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:13,270
language made for twelve year olds

709
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:17,470
anyway so that worked fine and I will

710
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:19,000
now demo it and I'll come back to this

711
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:28,800
can I take can I take this thing off

712
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:32,590
that's that work is working okay okay

713
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,629
so all day yesterday at our demo booth

714
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,189
on a mezzanine it worked perfectly now

715
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:39,160
it's barely working but I'll try my best

716
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,330
here I know you probably can't see the

717
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:48,450
Rope off from there but I'll do my best

718
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:48,449
here's forward oh stop there's no word

719
00:31:48,480 --> 00:32:00,670
now listen carefully for backward thank

720
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:02,379
you thank you here here's right now on

721
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,510
the tablecloth it's not doing so well

722
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,180
traction issues that's all we had a

723
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,120
piece of cardboard or booth left and the

724
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:17,160
forklift isn't working so well today

725
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:19,860
there goes it's barely moving now

726
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,200
no friggin one it's going down here and

727
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:26,199
I press the touch sensor touch sensor to

728
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,110
go stop see touch centers cut it off

729
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,490
I forgot the wire for the headlights and

730
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,050
I'm sure I don't know if you could see

731
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:38,190
this or not can you guys see this at all

732
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:38,190
okay that's pretty cool in my opinion

733
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,150
so that that is the LEGO version the

734
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,500
logo version excuse me and it's funny

735
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,180
because I make her fair and stuff these

736
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,920
all these teenagers like well well you

737
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,220
know where to put your Arduino and you

738
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,010
know

739
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,990
no it's an 8-bit computer I explain the

740
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,790
kids that okay today and Mindstorms you

741
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,480
got a little box goes in your robot the

742
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:05,720
computer is serving as the little box

743
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,760
that is the box so there was a second if

744
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,420
the first version was rare the second

745
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,030
version is incredibly rare Lego came out

746
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,630
at 87 with this new software called Lego

747
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,970
lines

748
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,110
I didn't even attempt around to use it

749
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,490
it's just the worst software ever

750
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,969
written

751
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:27,770
basically it's a shell because not a GUI

752
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:31,400
but it's a shell above above basic and

753
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:34,280
logo and it's a disaster and there was a

754
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:38,720
300 page manual for Lego lines which I

755
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:40,129
just skipped and I had previously a few

756
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,800
months before that thought you know what

757
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,830
I really want to do is program the Apple

758
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,060
side in basic and my friend dan and I

759
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,409
were you know he well he's like well

760
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:53,659
just use assembly said no because first

761
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:56,150
of all first of all assembly as much

762
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,010
more complicated I want to be able to

763
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,930
explain this to a ten-year-old I want to

764
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,360
build to show ten-year-old x equals 10

765
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,860
okay I don't want to show 10 year old

766
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,340
wall taking this block of memory and I'm

767
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:09,168
putting it over here in hexadecimal

768
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,310
the joke is there are F kinds of people

769
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,389
those who understand hex and the other E

770
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:18,860
yeah you guys figure so far feed on the

771
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:19,370
binary version right anyway and plus I

772
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,610
am it

773
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:26,929
I literally a few months ago did my

774
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:30,890
first hello hauled in 6502 ASM so I do a

775
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:33,168
selfie made no sense for me and we were

776
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,879
about to give up with any hope and doing

777
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:41,929
basic on this side how am i doing time

778
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:44,300
oh oh crap okay okay

779
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,560
and so we discover at the end of this

780
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,300
realtor page manual said if you wanted

781
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,340
to basic your summer jeans get started

782
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,149
wow great I'm gonna start talking faster

783
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,970
I thought I had a lot more time

784
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:57,330
so here's the initialization code for

785
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:59,790
the Apple basic side it's it sets a slot

786
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,940
number and then your address to the card

787
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,290
is the number plus the slot I'm 16 but

788
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,260
you have to do order of operations do

789
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:12,360
the multiplication first 10 20 turns on

790
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:15,830
the three chips clear the ports go so

791
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:19,530
this is the the basic code to send data

792
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:21,960
now as you see Apple Lego gives you like

793
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:24,240
in line 12 20 and stuff they give all

794
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,560
these crazy things DB and always extra

795
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,560
variables you don't need any of that

796
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:34,890
this is again a delay I did just do a

797
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,230
for next loop right just do like if you

798
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:40,259
want a half second delay for you know

799
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:44,850
for D equals 1 to 500 next on line of

800
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:46,680
code why do you need all this that's to

801
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:50,069
read data thing again way

802
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,990
over-engineered I hate it so that's what

803
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:55,140
I mentioned a minute ago discovered and

804
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,299
that was the big Epiphany dan and I had

805
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,950
because Dan's knowledge of electronic

806
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,900
nearing is way up here mine's way down

807
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,250
here and he was telling me oh well all

808
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
this code or you don't they look at all

809
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,450
this Cody was all it really does is poke

810
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,340
the ports is it timeout can't we just

811
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,589
poke them directly he's like I guess and

812
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,210
a him was so obvious he just kept me

813
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,870
over at tamiya was just like the angels

814
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:18,300
singing so that led to this discovery

815
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:21,900
that not any great epiphany Russian

816
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,310
whatever studied like math but ports you

817
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,080
know my mind they were reports and

818
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:30,960
danced mind well they're just bits in a

819
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:32,910
byte so he said ok port 0 is 1 2 4 8 etc

820
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,780
and we said ok all you have to do is

821
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:39,660
poke L which you dress at a card comma

822
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,970
the value of the decimal ports so if you

823
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,170
want to turn on port 1 and port 3 you

824
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:49,439
poke L comma 5 1 & 4 is 5 right

825
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,780
you want to port on port to import for L

826
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,450
comma 10 cuz Aidan 2 is 10 so go wow

827
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,350
that's really awesome so we skipped all

828
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,350
the horrible EO code

829
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:05,359
and the brute-force method so this is my

830
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,529
program in basic kind of like with the

831
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,940
logo thing did right but it's just

832
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:14,029
course index the initialization that's

833
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:17,990
boring instructions that's boring oh I

834
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:20,029
name the robot in line 2020 I need the

835
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,709
robot line ad which is Daniel backward

836
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:25,670
my friend I said he's dying to cancer so

837
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,950
they need a robot for him again same as

838
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,299
the logo code except for syntax but

839
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,669
you'll see what I do here in logo you

840
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:34,670
just tell it turn things on with the

841
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,210
poking originally I had okay line 30 20

842
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,250
if front back plus 75 then poke this and

843
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,140
for each one I had a poke and it wasn't

844
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,700
working the robot would stutter and my

845
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,038
friend Paul said no no no set them to a

846
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,288
variable consider all four options and

847
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:50,900
then poked a variable instead that

848
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:53,809
worked well and 36 T and M equals 10

849
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,240
call 1 on 8 : i nee is built into apple

850
00:37:53,809 --> 00:38:00,920
soft base ik it's a you know assembly a

851
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,308
procedure for a beep so that's how that

852
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,240
works

853
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:07,640
and then in logo you just tell it

854
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,589
literally if button on do this if not

855
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,589
but and do that an apple soft read a

856
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:17,509
button you got to do Peaks which are

857
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:19,308
pain but it's necessary evil and then

858
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:20,839
this is the code for the forklift to

859
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:23,569
check all the all the limits which is

860
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:29,808
way more code than a logo but imagine

861
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:31,970
how bad it would be an assembly so I'll

862
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:34,099
show you the basic site well the basics

863
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,348
I literally functions exactly the same

864
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,279
way the same exact demo so there's no

865
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,930
point of me showing you because you

866
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:41,539
can't tell the difference

867
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:45,399
trust me it works and then it come full

868
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:48,200
circle i back ported it to the IBM side

869
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,869
which i'll I want a demo but I think I'm

870
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,279
almost out of time so I'll bring this

871
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,750
demo back downstairs to our booth on a

872
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:55,460
mezzanine you could see it there that

873
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,410
there's compact portable because I think

874
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:02,119
I'm out of time but we had to make some

875
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:06,049
changes so on the IBM basic poke becomes

876
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,759
out PDL paper paddle becomes stick Pete

877
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:10,549
becomes straight which is stick trigger

878
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:13,690
and the backup be it's a beep statement

879
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,690
or a character

880
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,180
just for fun and I did a keyboard

881
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,309
control on the IBM side instead of a

882
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,770
joystick using like you know some of the

883
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,839
keys in the middle I like you know you

884
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:32,359
h-i-m or whatever it was instead of a

885
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:35,569
joystick there is some stuff for

886
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,660
assembly as I said I talked about this

887
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:40,579
earlier this is what Lego provides for

888
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,859
assembly I don't understand any of it

889
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,740
because I don't speak assembly yet but

890
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:46,910
I'm to learn and come back one day

891
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,200
engine you know maybe a lightning talk

892
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:51,368
next to hope or something I'll show the

893
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,368
assembly version if I know it by then

894
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:58,040
logo - just pretend it doesn't exist

895
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,030
there was an application called logo

896
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,700
writer robotics

897
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,470
so when Lego made their logo they gave

898
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,868
you a proprietary stripped down version

899
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,819
of real logo logo retro robotics they

900
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,160
give you the full version but no one has

901
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:12,470
a disk image it doesn't exist if anyone

902
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,259
has it you'll make me and a bunch of

903
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,609
other people's base any language so I

904
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,109
can talk to a parallel work couldn't

905
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:21,020
theoretically control this those

906
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:24,790
websites people have done that there is

907
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:27,020
a clock on the card on the Apple card

908
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,540
you'd have to do some of something to

909
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,270
access it in basic I think it'd be fun

910
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,680
to just do some scaling and make it so

911
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,390
you drive to robot around it Rises

912
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,279
sprite around the screen I did an

913
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,379
experiment that worked okay at least an

914
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,180
apple soft basic and it will be fun to

915
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,210
try to have come up with a way to use

916
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,058
this to control Mindstorms I think

917
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,740
that'd be fun you could really push that

918
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:50,180
like you could do an Apple 2 emulator on

919
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,250
an Android phone or something and you

920
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,319
know if you had if you had a you know if

921
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,000
you had some sort of Android way to

922
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,099
control a parallel port Bluetooth the

923
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,510
parallel port and theory that could work

924
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:04,280
on the Commodore you wouldn't need a

925
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,170
card because it has a software built the

926
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,660
hardware built in the computer you would

927
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,410
just need a write cable there was a cool

928
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,359
plotter kit if you attach multiple

929
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,980
interfaces boxes a multiple cards to a

930
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,319
computer think about what you can build

931
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,369
right what if I attach the four cards

932
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,369
you can build amazing things

933
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,970
there's always websites about where you

934
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,599
can buy a kit they're hard to find are

935
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,308
expensive

936
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,739
as they said I'm working on getting

937
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:33,140
schematics this guy in Australia

938
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:35,839
Alex lucassi has this great blog post

939
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,578
about the Apple 2 side but his talks

940
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,140
about he has manuals and stuff and

941
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,269
technical stuff but it doesn't really

942
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,460
get into how to use it how to actually

943
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:45,709
use it but you don't learn English by

944
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,999
reading a dictionary right so that's

945
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,499
what I'm focusing on is how to use ok I

946
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:55,430
like to one more so I left two more

947
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:56,569
slides left ok I'll go as fast as I

948
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,160
possibly can

949
00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:00,859
I'm making a website all about this

950
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,210
mines before the storm calm please go

951
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:06,380
there and visit my fundraising link and

952
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:11,779
the last slide we make our fair bla bla

953
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:15,549
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla I wanted

954
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:18,019
your Q&A but that's not possible now so

955
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:20,420
ok yeah I'll bring this all down to my

956
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:33,200
Byzantine and please come see it ask me

957
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:40,269
questions thank you I thought I would

958
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,269
even feel my ok thank you
