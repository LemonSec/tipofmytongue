18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,500
good morning my name is Dan Bartholomew

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,070
I am the executive director for free

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
geek in Portland free geek was started

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,140
in the year 2000 so we've been around

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,260
for about 18 years

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,590
we started with four guys as an idea and

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,740
the idea was there is planned at abyssal

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,689
essence in the technology market and

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,570
every two years everybody trades out

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,758
what they have for technology and it

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,070
ends up wherever it ends up it could go

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,600
to China it could go to India it could

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,539
go to a landfill meanwhile there are 17%

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,158
of the United States that do not have a

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,490
device and are not connected to the

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,850
Internet 39% of rural America is not

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:46,048
connected to the Internet or or even

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,689
have devices that 39% even if they have

36
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,869
a device it could be a two to five hour

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,169
drive to get a new device and or get

38
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,030
their device repaired so they took those

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,579
two problems and they they faced them

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,799
off to each other and they said why

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,658
don't we take the devices that are

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,329
perfectly fine that are just a couple

43
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,509
years old refurbish them get them to be

44
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,760
nearly new again and give them to the

45
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,269
people that need them so that we can

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,410
bridge the digital divide

47
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,120
we can get those 17% of America and 39%

48
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,540
of rural America to start working on

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,480
things like curing cancer cleaning the

50
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,760
water removing the landfills that

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,010
they're filling with these 150,000

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,019
devices that we are getting rid of every

53
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:37,660
single day that was the dream so we

54
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,260
started out a free geek in Portland with

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,470
about two thousand square feet and four

56
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,700
people over the last 18 years we've

57
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:52,840
grown to be about 45 people in staff we

58
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:57,269
serve about 4,000 volunteers a year and

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,460
we have about 25,000 square feet that is

60
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,900
refurbishing about 1.5 million pounds of

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:08,830
e-waste every single year part of our

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,750
mission was to try and give birth to

63
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,550
other free geeks that are across the

64
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,830
United States there are 11 three free

65
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,330
geeks across the United States one in

66
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:23,470
Oslo Norway of all places there are

67
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,840
about 78 nonprofit refurbishers in the

68
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,730
United States we have a great

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,830
representation here of the other free

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:33,190
geeks that were started

71
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,830
we are not franchising these free geeks

72
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,740
all we do is we provide a charter we

73
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,300
give them guidance and we help them get

74
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,030
started and give them guidance along the

75
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,920
way hopefully to get things going and

76
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:52,750
keep things moving as best as we

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:56,369
possibly can I can't tell you what this

78
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:00,580
means to our community in Portland as

79
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:03,340
well as the United States what we're

80
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,000
doing is we're changing lives or

81
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,240
changing lives by doing technology

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,920
refurbishment there was a woman that

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:18,310
came in she was a teenager in in high

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,070
school kayla was her name and Kayla came

85
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,800
in and she gave 24 hours of community

86
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:27,570
service to us and as a result of that we

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,570
give her a computer we give away

88
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,730
thousands of devices every single year

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,280
we serve between six and eight

90
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,050
nonprofits every single week providing

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,750
them with all the technology that they

92
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,660
need but Kayla came in after her 24

93
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,790
hours of service and I gave her her

94
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,870
laptop she started working on it she was

95
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,590
going through her class

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,330
and she was crying and I said Kayla why

97
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,349
are you crying he's just got a laptop

98
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,419
and she said you don't understand I've

99
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,660
been doing all of my papers on my phone

100
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:04,320
and I've been standing outside of my

101
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,139
school so that I had Wi-Fi connection in

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,370
order to upload my papers when they were

103
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:14,030
done that's what free geek does what

104
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,479
free geek does is connects the world and

105
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,250
makes a difference in that way I'm

106
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,710
talking from my perspective I'd really

107
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,260
like to hear from the panel so if we

108
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,109
could start Zach maybe you could start a

109
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,889
sack and bring us across and and talk

110
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,979
about what you're doing in your

111
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,840
community so my community in

112
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,700
Fayetteville Arkansas is much smaller

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,500
than most of these other communities in

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,289
general we're about the tenth the size

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,360
that you are we'll do probably a hundred

116
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:45,240
and fifty thousand pounds of e-waste

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,820
this year and it's very much in the

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,979
similar mold lots and lots of people in

119
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,450
our community are rural you know

120
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,150
something like ninety percent of the

121
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,130
state of Arkansas is completely rural so

122
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,919
even though we live in an urban center

123
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:02,600
we service everyone throughout the state

124
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,590
we send computers to the Delta we send

125
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,840
copiers and things like that to

126
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,520
nonprofits that otherwise you know

127
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,229
couldn't have access to that tech at all

128
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,909
it's thousands of dollars for them and

129
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,639
that's usually the difference between a

130
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,530
person and a piece of technology so

131
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,289
we're really fortunate in that way to be

132
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,900
able to impact those lives we've

133
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,300
migrated a lot over the years from just

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,940
having whole desktop computers couldn't

135
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,820
find a laptop anywhere to now having

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,880
some and it's been very transformative

137
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,400
for us so we're able to connect with and

138
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,820
touch thousands of people every single

139
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,989
year and these are people that wouldn't

140
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:45,140
have any computing resources whatsoever

141
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,790
thank you job I'm no longer actively

142
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,880
involved with the free geek organization

143
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:53,450
but I did work with one and the one

144
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,219
charlie is with now free IT Athens for I

145
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,880
think it was seven years or something

146
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:03,350
like that and when I began working with

147
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,060
this group it was in this school

148
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,190
building it was basically falling apart

149
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,940
we had to put umbrellas in the ceiling

150
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,490
to keep water away from the servers and

151
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,620
we had a really good space though and I

152
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,980
saw like a lot of things that were going

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,290
on there that to me it was it was really

154
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,820
it wasn't really about technology so

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,220
much as it was about community building

156
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,440
and community organizing and getting

157
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,820
people the help and knowledge and

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,120
understanding of technology that they

159
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:35,900
need and I have so many stories to share

160
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,820
over the years with free ite Athens I

161
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,789
saw it grow from that old school

162
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,159
building to now like a shopping center

163
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,900
which was a goal that we had had

164
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,470
originally to get out of that building

165
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,000
and have like a face front facing space

166
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,890
and I think it's doing pretty well from

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,880
what I can tell on Charlie can speak

168
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:58,610
more about that I think yeah we're doing

169
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,000
really well um you know we moved to a

170
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,490
shopping center so we have walkability

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,200
people before we're in a warehouse when

172
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,240
I got involved or in a warehouse so we

173
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,460
were on the bus line which if you're

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,140
starting one of these organizations do

175
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,710
keep transportation in mind being on a

176
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,000
bus line is so so very helpful but we

177
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,130
were in a warehouse so people would take

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,570
the bus to come out to this warehouse it

179
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,270
wasn't really anything unless they were

180
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,800
earth they were recording music nothing

181
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,539
else out there and now you know there's

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,420
there's several stores and restaurants

183
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:33,590
and you know nail salon so you can come

184
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,990
out and shop and get your technology fix

185
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,310
but no we're doing fantastic it's about

186
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,969
2,000 square feet

187
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:45,140
last year we recycled 19 tons of e-waste

188
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:50,250
which is to t-rexes worth of ear eggs I

189
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:53,170
learned last year we had 126 volunteers

190
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,110
serving over 5,000 hours to our

191
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,430
community and we have 18 staff members

192
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,470
which I don't know if you knew that that

193
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,449
is tremendous

194
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,460
yeah so our stat were an entirely

195
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,410
volunteer run organization so I'm a

196
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,540
volunteer Joel was a volunteer everyone

197
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,219
in there was volunteering and having 18

198
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,900
people who are stepping up and saying

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,150
okay I'm going to take responsibility

200
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,160
and leadership in this organization is

201
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,040
just mind-blowing and I'm forever

202
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,589
grateful and so this year so far we've

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,790
distributed 200 computers so I don't

204
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,160
know if this is true of the other

205
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,719
organizations but free software isn't

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,030
our mission and that's very very

207
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,850
important to us so so as well as

208
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,240
bridging the digital divide and

209
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,780
eliminating e-waste so that's 200 people

210
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,580
who have free software in their homes

211
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:45,010
and free software alternatives yeah

212
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:46,720
so it's thank you thank you and well and

213
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,730
that's just the rush store so we have a

214
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,350
store where computers start out at $15

215
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,690
we try to keep that as affordable as

216
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,300
possible so that's not counting

217
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,950
community grant programs or we also give

218
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,740
away computers to volunteers for meeting

219
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,310
certain milestones so that's just that

220
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,720
yeah and I also have so many stories

221
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,479
that I wish I could share but I'm taking

222
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,700
too much time so I'm gonna pass it over

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,940
Thanks so I'm here from freakin Toronto

224
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,160
um pretty much everyone ever in said

225
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,870
except change pounds to kilograms you

226
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,160
know but the one big difference that

227
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,300
make that does this thing which is

228
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,430
slightly different from everyone else is

229
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,270
that we've had to shift because of the

230
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,459
way the environment in our in Ontario in

231
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,650
the province is we've even had to switch

232
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,060
to become a what's called a employment

233
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,220
social enterprise which means that our

234
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,510
focus is on having volunteers also help

235
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,920
with the refurbishment recycling but

236
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,780
it's also giving people the opportunity

237
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,640
to get jobs who face barriers to

238
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,170
employment so you get people who you

239
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,790
know I've had long absences are coming

240
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,979
in to tech for as a second career or

241
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,599
they're newcomers to the to the country

242
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,370
and they don't have the Canadian the

243
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,050
quote-unquote experience to make it in

244
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,240
in North America to get their first job

245
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,709
so they come to us and we are able to

246
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,420
kind of give them that opportunity to

247
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,450
kind of move forward you know we still

248
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,459
have like we sold I think by now this

249
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,890
time of the year about 200 computers

250
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,390
like everybody else and I can't do the

251
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,850
conversion but we're at about like about

252
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,340
a metric ton of e-waste we've done I

253
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,650
don't know what that is actually pounds

254
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,940
and it's really just kind of so we we do

255
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,829
all that stuff but it's really kind of

256
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,510
us also incorporating this thing of like

257
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,130
really helping people you know kind of

258
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,390
get back on their feet and stuff like

259
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,830
that so you know bridging the digital

260
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,020
divide in a way that also includes

261
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,670
getting people you know employment and

262
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,860
really kind of using that that

263
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,890
opportunity there further into education

264
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,670
or into other employment goals and so

265
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:39,130
yeah great thanks right I think you

266
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,229
heard a theme across the the entire

267
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,150
panelists that it's really about the

268
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,080
community it's about what we're doing in

269
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,840
the community at free geek Portland we

270
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,630
we do about 6,000 hours of education

271
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,370
every single year and it's really about

272
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,070
but it's about the face that's in front

273
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,540
of you at the time many times we're

274
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,200
working with people that are coming out

275
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,680
of challenging situations they're coming

276
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,520
out of homelessness they have no device

277
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,079
they have no way of making an impact in

278
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,210
the world that they really want to make

279
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,960
so teaching those basic job skills

280
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:19,390
teaching those basic you know show up on

281
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,670
time don't break anything listen to your

282
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,790
boss take a break when you need to take

283
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,670
a break those basic job skills is a lot

284
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,380
of what we're doing I'd like to ask the

285
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,719
panel

286
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,689
may we start at Ryan and come this way

287
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,610
this time what it what is the impact you

288
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,250
think you're making in your community

289
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,170
what kinds of things do you see on a

290
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,950
daily basis and Charlie this is a great

291
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:47,880
time to tell your stories so we have a

292
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,560
core staff of about eight people and all

293
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,960
of them except for myself face some kind

294
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,280
of barrier to employment and we have

295
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,840
people transitioning out of our

296
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,459
organization you know so we have people

297
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
like 20 people coming through because

298
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,160
they're just kind of using this as a

299
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,010
stepping stone and going through and the

300
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,230
amount of you know confidence they get

301
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,330
from just being in a workplace but being

302
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,770
very supported and learning about TUC

303
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,890
because you know these are people who

304
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,840
may you know like we have one gentleman

305
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,400
who came in who you know knew how to use

306
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,470
a computer but you know wasn't really

307
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,120
that confident and by the now he's one

308
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,100
of our best sales person salespeople

309
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,290
because when people come in he's able to

310
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,700
empathize with their lack of technology

311
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,620
and really kind of you know talk to them

312
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,830
on their level while also being very

313
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,990
honest with the what the machines have

314
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,910
to offer and so that really kind of puts

315
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,590
people who are digitally literate or you

316
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,030
know not comfortable technology in a

317
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,290
space where they or they know that they

318
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,780
can come here and really kind of learn

319
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,310
from that and you know that you can't

320
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,220
put that in a quantify how important

321
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,780
that is to to us for him but in terms of

322
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,400
what we do in our community like we

323
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,420
really try and make sure that we're

324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,699
getting out into the communities that

325
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,920
need us rather than the people who find

326
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,270
us we you know because we have a lot of

327
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,579
people come in who are you know tech

328
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,990
enthusiasts hobbyist hackers who really

329
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,610
can kind of take advantage of the tech

330
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,930
to its large degree but we have to

331
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,550
really make an effort to go out to the

332
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,620
communities where there's a little bit

333
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,959
more social isolation or there's

334
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,790
language barrier you know like like New

335
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,590
York Toronto has communities where

336
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,599
people their language is a huge barrier

337
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,550
and so we have to make a real effort to

338
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,740
kind of you know meet somebody there

339
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,939
who's an enthusiast in a certain

340
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,600
community that has the language skills

341
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,190
and then take our items to the community

342
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,410
to people who really really needed the

343
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,610
most and if they didn't have we didn't

344
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,530
have this kind of link with them

345
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,650
wouldn't even know we existed because

346
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,520
you know um because we don't all speak

347
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,709
you know

348
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,910
languages so yeah so it's really that's

349
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,860
that's really how we kind of you know

350
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,860
Broadway kind of deal we get our hands

351
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,780
thank you so our impacting the community

352
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,330
I do don't really have a metric I wish I

353
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,400
did for that but I have amazing stories

354
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,780
and yeah so employments huge I had no I

355
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,449
didn't saw it until I started

356
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,860
volunteering how big of it well of

357
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,840
course I knew employments a big deal but

358
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,580
how much a non-profit like this can make

359
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,740
a difference in someone's you know job

360
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,140
professional life and to the point where

361
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,240
recently we've had so many people go

362
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,430
from not having a job to gainfully

363
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,080
employed with full benefits they're

364
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,630
actually having trouble staying open

365
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,200
during business hours cuz I think ya

366
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:19,020
find anyone exactly exactly

367
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,190
which is an amazing problem to have you

368
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,579
know one of those problems I'm grateful

369
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,460
for but yet language is a huge huge

370
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,240
barrier that and I've definitely had to

371
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,820
wrote clients into translating for other

372
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,120
clients I've been in that position but

373
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,910
you know the little things is what warms

374
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,730
my heart so one of my favorite

375
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,860
experiences is a young family came in

376
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,330
and out of respect for her privacy I'll

377
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,950
call her D and she she came in and she

378
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,480
with her toddler and her husband and

379
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,270
they were getting Internet in their home

380
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,370
for the very first time and I got to

381
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,960
show them the shelves and answer the

382
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,050
questions we picked out their very first

383
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,480
computer and you know together we set up

384
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,030
the username password and we learned you

385
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,580
know how to use we're using Ubuntu so we

386
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,170
learned lube unto and she asked me if I

387
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,420
could help her set up her very first

388
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,130
email address and she said of her very

389
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,870
for his email address and then she asked

390
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:20,420
if we could work on writing a resume and

391
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,640
I still get emails from her about the

392
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,449
job she got from writing a resume

393
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,330
together and it's those like little you

394
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,550
know face-to-face moments that just that

395
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,980
that's the difference you're making in

396
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,680
the community and it's incredible now

397
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,660
we're at the point where we we've kind

398
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,630
of had to look inward so we're not doing

399
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,810
a lot of outreach that we should be to

400
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,300
find those communities who aren't able

401
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,339
to find us but in the past and I'm sure

402
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,279
Joel can talk about this y'all have done

403
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,750
amazing outreach and I'm almost I'm sad

404
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,920
we didn't do the slideshows we were

405
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,600
gonna do a slideshow but it'd take too

406
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,079
much time because I have pictures of

407
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:05,990
very young Joel in community outreach

408
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:10,010
things yeah there's so again I probably

409
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,260
can't pick one story and especially

410
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,619
since I stepped away and I've looked at

411
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,240
other organizations but I am a community

412
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,208
worker so I have like 10 years of

413
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,370
organizing experience in this area but I

414
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,170
always viewed the free gig model is like

415
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,540
the Food Not Bombs of computers if

416
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,429
anybody is familiar with that model as

417
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,530
you're taking discarded computers you're

418
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,150
getting them to people in need and the

419
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,950
secret recipe they're like vegan

420
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,200
vegetarian food with Food Not Bombs and

421
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,000
bird rescue food is free software that's

422
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,660
what Thai is people to each other and

423
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,720
community instead of like a corporation

424
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,000
but some outcomes I've seen from other

425
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,880
free geeks and preliminary evidence from

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,580
my dissertation work has been actually

427
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,010
strikingly similar to community gardens

428
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,020
believe it or not I've been calling them

429
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:01,010
silicon community gardens because they

430
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,510
have so many similarities there are when

431
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,340
you go into like a space and work

432
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,440
together there's a chance for like

433
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,760
racial and ethnic class consciousness

434
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,500
building with you you might interact

435
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,110
with people you had never interacted

436
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,280
with before right people that are

437
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,479
neurodivergent people that are

438
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,800
experiencing homelessness or

439
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,690
interpersonal violence or whatever is

440
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,450
going on in their lives I'm working with

441
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,230
somebody maybe that's more privileged it

442
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,240
doesn't come from that kind of

443
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,290
background so you have a class

444
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,230
consciousness sister though but of

445
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,030
course the job thing is a big thing but

446
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,260
I think not everybody is coming in there

447
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,470
obviously to translate this to

448
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,240
employment I mean

449
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,419
sometimes empowerment can translate to

450
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,549
just having a better life right you get

451
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,259
chosen to lead a project within the

452
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,700
organization and you feel empowered and

453
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,139
you were scared to talk to people you

454
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,690
were scared to stand in front of people

455
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:47,158
before and now you're doing it and you

456
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,139
can do that in other areas of your life

457
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,250
so I think that there is a lot of

458
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:56,580
individual and community empowerment

459
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:59,460
that can happen there it can bridge from

460
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,840
one space to across a large city I found

461
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,009
that in one of the places I was looking

462
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,629
at and it organizes community so that's

463
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,429
within the organization your organizing

464
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:10,408
community itself and then outside you

465
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,080
can community organize right but

466
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,610
sometimes when you are so focused inside

467
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,470
because of structural issues and will

468
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,459
probably get to that on at some point

469
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,710
you're not able to reach out but very

470
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,870
quickly free ite Athens we did a number

471
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,519
of outreach projects I tried to push for

472
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,258
that in Athens because I did see that

473
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,000
problem like a lot of people coming in

474
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,769
that were you know maybe more privileged

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,480
or we were hitting were hitting certain

476
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,899
neighborhoods or demographics that we

477
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,029
need to and as everyone probably knows

478
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:41,729
is that you know this term digital

479
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:45,419
divide which is an academic term but it

480
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,769
hits every marginalized population you

481
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,759
think of more july's population they're

482
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:54,779
likely intersected with this concept of

483
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:57,539
the digital divide yeah it's sort of a

484
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:01,110
dovetail on that Joel I you know people

485
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,610
work not just for money right people

486
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,250
work for personal fulfillment and things

487
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,199
like that and you talk about community

488
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,850
gardens as a model that's very similar

489
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,440
to freaking I find that as well as a

490
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,240
matter of fact one of our current

491
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,919
volunteers that works with this is a

492
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,110
community gardener and organizer in

493
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,090
creating one and he's fell upon an

494
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,979
unfortunate time where he can't work his

495
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,559
normal job but he can come and make an

496
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,809
impact at free geek and so he puts in

497
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,519
quite a few hours and is learning and

498
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,590
enjoying that but that's not necessarily

499
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,600
going to turn into some sort of you know

500
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,908
corporate gig or technology thing but

501
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,439
that certainly has happened for many of

502
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,360
our volunteers over the years that come

503
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,399
in knowing something looking for a

504
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,860
better life don't know how to get it and

505
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:42,719
spending enough time working learning

506
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,310
that they do have this skill or or that

507
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,440
you know the skill isn't something on it

508
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,570
aníbal right refurbishing a computer or

509
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,070
installing operating systems but anyone

510
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,990
can have it putting in the time with

511
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,090
just a little bit of guidance and so

512
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,730
having those opportunities there for

513
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,919
anybody who wants it becomes a real real

514
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,000
changer of their lives so we have all

515
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,700
those communities you talked about

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,310
homeless people those have been out of

517
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,590
work for a long time those that are just

518
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,270
tech enthusiasts and and people who want

519
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,120
to make an impact in their own community

520
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,160
they spend their time willingly with us

521
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,010
we still don't quite know why but we

522
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,020
enjoy it and so we hope that we can do a

523
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,490
whole lot more through that one of the

524
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,870
big things that we've offered throughout

525
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,610
the years that we think makes a really

526
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,070
big impact in the community is internet

527
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,659
access so from our beginning as part of

528
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,700
our mission is to guarantee that there's

529
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,770
free and open Internet access at our

530
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,430
location and anytime we're open for

531
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,650
anyone to use

532
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,720
so there's restrictions and other public

533
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,670
facilities like public libraries for

534
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,020
instance where you may be able to go in

535
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,570
and use their internet but you need a

536
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,760
device or you can go in and use their

537
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,889
devices but for limited time frames and

538
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,720
we try to open that up quite a bit we

539
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,370
have an internet cafe where there's

540
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,690
computers there and printers and things

541
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,969
like that that you can just use for free

542
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,650
as long as you need to and plenty of

543
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,870
people you know find their next cars

544
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,020
that way or their next job or their next

545
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,760
loved one you know we don't judge and

546
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,050
all of that seems to be a pretty big

547
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,240
deal thank you yeah the the the digital

548
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:13,550
divide is really a four legged stool

549
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:17,610
yeah you need a device you need access

550
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,020
you need education and you need tech

551
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,939
support yeah

552
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,550
the last one is usually the one that

553
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,220
that kind of falls away you can get a

554
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,159
device and get access you can get a

555
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,840
little bit of Education you get online

556
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,500
but that tech support is really

557
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,139
important a lot of folks don't realize

558
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,670
that especially in rural America it

559
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,500
could be a two and a half to four hour

560
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:46,860
drive to fix a mouse and this is an area

561
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,760
where Google isn't a verb you know

562
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,310
people don't Google things

563
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,840
they may they may want to understand

564
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,490
something but they can't google it

565
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,610
because they don't have access or they

566
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,080
the access is so slow that you put into

567
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,689
Google and then you can walk away make

568
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,240
dinner come back and maybe you'll have

569
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:09,700
the answer but it takes a long time to

570
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,610
get access I guess the the next question

571
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,240
I would have for the panel would be

572
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:19,990
what's the difference between what we do

573
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:24,550
as nonprofit refurbishers and the

574
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:28,270
for-profit refurbishers which is as a

575
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:30,730
whole we battle everyday against folks

576
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,360
that will give you twelve dollars for a

577
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,460
laptop and then of course once they

578
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,689
bring in the laptops and they process

579
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:44,890
them then they also bill back for that

580
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,140
which they cannot turn around so it

581
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,240
actually turns into about a zero-sum

582
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,420
game for corporations but the

583
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,660
corporation's don't really see that so I

584
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,440
really wanted to get the panel's view on

585
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,370
us versus the the for-profit

586
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,440
refurbishers and and Charlie you're

587
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,870
smiling too much for me to not start

588
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,860
with you so I'm going to start with you

589
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:16,179
okay well we're not making money so all

590
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,879
our tech support is drop in not drop off

591
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,470
a donation based tech support and that's

592
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,150
really really important so the donation

593
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,050
based of course is really important

594
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,160
because you don't know how far these

595
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:28,360
people are coming from you don't know

596
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:31,000
what they can offer so a few dollars is

597
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,129
great if you can if not that's okay but

598
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,510
I think you know out it's outside of

599
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:39,220
money um the the drop the drop in rather

600
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,620
than drop off is hugely important

601
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,740
because it becomes not only a community

602
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,679
building opportunity but an opportunity

603
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,860
for education right so we for every tech

604
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:55,120
support session we have our goal is not

605
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:58,540
only to solve the problem but hopefully

606
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,149
the the client leaves learn knowing more

607
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,430
than they

608
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,530
when they walked in and and then it

609
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:07,550
becomes an empowerment opportunity yeah

610
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:09,680
we've taken at free geek Portland we

611
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,659
started with that the model of coming in

612
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,030
and we do as much as we possibly can for

613
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,610
you but we have so many folks that come

614
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,110
in that we started struggling with you

615
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,899
know how do we take care of all these

616
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,909
folks so we went to a model where we

617
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,230
have and tech support gets a lot of

618
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,300
interns I don't know if you have the

619
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,410
same experience but it's it's it's a

620
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,970
great launching point and we have

621
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,680
organizations in Portland that are now

622
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,720
taking our graduates from our internship

623
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,180
programs that will take them directly in

624
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,290
and employ them and they sponsor us for

625
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,600
that too which is awesome but we've

626
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:48,620
taken and we put a limit on the tech

627
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,240
support window of 15 minutes if it goes

628
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,219
beyond 15 minutes then we've got

629
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,400
volunteers that will do one-on-ones

630
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,890
for up to two hours which is awesome

631
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,630
right so they so if you if you really

632
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,490
want to dig into a topic or somebody's

633
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,230
really struggling with something we take

634
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,380
them we put them in the classroom and

635
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,110
they just go at it for two hours which

636
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,230
is really great I mean they they move be

637
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:18,709
well beyond where they came in in that

638
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:22,310
model one of the problems that that we

639
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,660
have in Portland and I'm sure the I'm

640
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,000
looking forward to hearing what the

641
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,370
panel said we have spent like 15 minutes

642
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,840
together by the way so and we are just

643
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:34,209
as interested in hearing each other's

644
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,209
talks as you guys are to hear our talks

645
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,930
one of the problems we have in Portland

646
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,930
is getting corporate donations when it

647
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,760
comes to donations technology is key for

648
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:48,380
us to turn things around and get them

649
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,620
back out we we take in about like I said

650
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,070
about 1.5 1.3 to 1.5 million pounds of

651
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,139
e-waste every year but we can only turn

652
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,570
around this month we did about 30

653
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,840
percent turnaround on that we get about

654
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,939
2000 systems a month we were only able

655
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,419
to turn around about 30% of that mostly

656
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,980
because it comes from folks and so it's

657
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,230
it's been sitting in somebody's closet

658
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,669
it's been collecting dust it's

659
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:19,010
it's it's a white back Mac um around for

660
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,309
a while and we can't really turn that

661
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:25,340
around we must recycle in many many

662
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:27,049
cases but from corporations that turn

663
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,720
around their technology about every two

664
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:31,340
to three years and they're

665
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,049
well-maintained and they're sitting in

666
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,939
an office space and they're not full of

667
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:39,320
you know ten thousand years of cat hair

668
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:42,139
we can turn those things around pretty

669
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,460
quickly and pretty well but getting

670
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:46,428
those corporate donations are a

671
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,779
challenge a lot of times corporations

672
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:49,399
will say well you know you're a

673
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,529
non-profit how do I know that you're

674
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,080
professional how that you how do we know

675
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:58,429
that you're gonna you know handle our

676
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,649
data securely all of those questions and

677
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:02,059
we've done a lot in order to make sure

678
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:05,928
that that's true so we're neighed

679
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:08,269
members so we we make sure that we

680
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,769
securely handle everybody's data and

681
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,320
then that comes in with data whether

682
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:14,450
it's a Roku or it's a laptop or it's a

683
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,600
desktop we it goes directly into our

684
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,159
caged off secure area where we we clean

685
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,959
all the data if we can't clean it we

686
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,399
destroy it and we take care of all those

687
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,620
things but getting corporations to

688
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,049
believe in us and getting that trust

689
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,389
level is really difficult I'd love to

690
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:35,029
hear the experiences of the panel on

691
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:39,620
that Brian yeah

692
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:41,090
so the we've gotten into so god I love

693
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,559
bureaucracy because in Ontario there's a

694
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,549
lot of bureaucracy around electronic

695
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,320
ways because they really tried to make

696
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,389
it like a huge environmental promise up

697
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,490
there which meant that for us to become

698
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:51,490
a refurbish or recycle we had to be

699
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,500
certified by a governmental organization

700
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,510
so that builds an automatic level of

701
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,669
trust there that we probably that a lot

702
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,990
of I don't know a lot of other people

703
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:01,399
have to deal with because we can just

704
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,620
point at something saying like notice

705
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:05,268
this this body is said we're okay and

706
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,039
that we're following all these rules

707
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:08,809
were securely wiping your data we're

708
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,549
locking things up you know people are

709
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,928
handling your stuff no have a code

710
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,210
account we have a code of conduct around

711
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,769
privacy and security and stuff like that

712
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,059
so there's there's all these built-in

713
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:18,559
mechanisms that kind of come

714
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,230
from just having like a piece of paper

715
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,779
on the wall that you know some but check

716
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,279
marked a couple months ago but you know

717
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,590
it really that that that really can help

718
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,600
us and that helps us with going to IT

719
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,759
professionals in big corporations where

720
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,649
we're making you know inroads where we

721
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,110
go to we go to both the marketing and

722
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:37,908
the IT people because the marketing

723
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,620
people were the good publicity and the

724
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,820
IT people know you know they kind of

725
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,289
went a little dig into us they know we

726
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,240
know what we're talking about and so

727
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,710
those two those two branches of a within

728
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,149
a corporation really kind of if they

729
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,519
come together they really kind of help

730
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:50,689
us we have had a I can't really name

731
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,369
them here but we've had a lot of

732
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,350
corporations in Toronto who you know

733
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:55,699
they just they just come and don't dump

734
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,590
their stuff off at us and it's like

735
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,509
really quality stuff and you know

736
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,129
graphic design firms by the way are the

737
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:02,539
best because they have lots of Iraq's

738
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:05,928
they're getting rid of every year and

739
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:07,100
it's all beautiful but um but you know

740
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,269
so that's really that's kind of that's

741
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,678
kind of how we've been able to deal with

742
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:11,629
it is that we really have to kind of we

743
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,049
really try and target it and we and we

744
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:16,850
have a large group of supporters in our

745
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:18,740
customers the people come in like we

746
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,998
have you know customers from the local

747
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,019
school board or some like that who are

748
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,820
coming in and then saying like oh I'm

749
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,320
gonna turn around and go to the head of

750
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,178
my department and say you should get

751
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,029
them and now we have 100 French

752
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,869
keyboards so if anyone needs that you

753
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,799
know you know so it's things like that

754
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:35,168
it's really just kind of making those

755
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,158
connections and it's really kind of

756
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,230
telling people showing people that you

757
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,850
know this is a community this is really

758
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,369
going to good works it's not just going

759
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,779
to line some of these pockets or you

760
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,639
know the other big thing for us that

761
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:49,100
everything gets recite the focuses on so

762
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:50,959
much on recycling on just getting rid of

763
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,539
the stuff and breaking it down whereas

764
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,860
we're like no no no first thing we need

765
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:58,429
to do the most environmentally friendly

766
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,049
thing to do is to reuse and so we focus

767
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:02,360
we really focus on that messaging and

768
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:04,009
you know using the opens free and open

769
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,080
source software and the community

770
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:07,690
involvement and all those packages goes

771
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,999
right together and people just you know

772
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,700
it's it's a hard sell but you know get

773
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:16,519
the time you get some good results exact

774
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,320
you and I yeah so so we almost find that

775
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,080
they take you more serious if you charge

776
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,549
them you know if we offer to come and

777
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,189
pick it up for free and something well

778
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,179
there must be some scam going on so if

779
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,619
you're just getting started you're

780
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,980
having trouble with corporations you

781
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,139
know charge them a token

782
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,149
and that seems to open more doors that's

783
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,789
true that's amazing is it not yeah yeah

784
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:37,110
we've gone up against national contracts

785
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:38,760
and we've said well we're gonna do this

786
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,740
for free you know we'll do the pick ups

787
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,720
we'll take it in because you know if

788
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,250
they've got 500,000 people you know we

789
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,860
figure we're gonna get I don't know ten

790
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,320
thousand laptops a month and their

791
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,149
leaders don't believe us you know that

792
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:59,939
we would want to do that you know they

793
00:31:51,149 --> 00:32:02,639
would do anything for free exactly one

794
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:07,350
of the challenges that we have all of us

795
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:10,500
have is the right to repair many of

796
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:14,820
these organizations like Apple as an

797
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:18,269
example just an example our very closed

798
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:23,428
are very closed we can't get schematics

799
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:25,470
we can't get om parts we can't get they

800
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:28,610
will not they we break warranty if we

801
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,799
open up the machine there's a lot of

802
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:35,039
what we need to do in Portland is we

803
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,320
will decompose something re-engineer it

804
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,700
and bring it back out in order to learn

805
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:46,168
it and then we pass that on to our other

806
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:48,029
through iFixit or through others we we

807
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:50,399
try and pass on that knowledge so that

808
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:52,950
we can repair the stuff that we own

809
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,949
because you don't really own it unless

810
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:58,500
you can repair it so I'd love to hear

811
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,600
some of the challenges across the the

812
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,769
panel and in write to repair and what

813
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,019
you're doing within your states for

814
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:08,809
instance for instance to try and get

815
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:18,029
those those laws remade or in Canada

816
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:20,010
hate glue it's it's an interesting thing

817
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,389
because we the laws are a little bit

818
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,730
different where the right to repair

819
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:25,860
there's a lot there's a lot of movement

820
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,620
around it especially in like the larger

821
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,330
cities to kind of do it but you know the

822
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,830
focus for us like like in the States I

823
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,870
think here's more around like larger

824
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,519
equipment like

825
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,489
tractors and stuff like that and trying

826
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,320
to bring in electronics into that

827
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:42,230
sometimes you meet it's a diverging

828
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,178
needs but we yeah we partner with a lot

829
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,610
of organizations that are really kind of

830
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:47,929
advocating for the right to repair you

831
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,090
know there's an organization in Toronto

832
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:51,860
we think it's a part of the repair cafe

833
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,689
movement which goes around like you know

834
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,908
helps people repair stuff for free and

835
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,649
so we you know you know use them a lot

836
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:01,749
and you know we just try to through our

837
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:05,989
efforts do it but yeah it's it's tough

838
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:10,099
yeah yeah I recently spoke to the

839
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,020
Washington Congress Washington not the

840
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:13,849
United States government but but

841
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,509
Washington State about their right to

842
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:19,369
repair California's got a bill active

843
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,200
Washington has a bill active we're

844
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,829
working to get a bill active in Oregon

845
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,750
as well to just get right to repair

846
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:27,950
because it is it impacts our business so

847
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,339
much

848
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:34,189
Mac's are in such great demand and our

849
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:35,540
ability to get people graduated to the

850
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,649
point where they can actually repair

851
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,520
them is really difficult

852
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,290
understanding where stuff is in a

853
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,079
desktop and how to repair a desktop is

854
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,810
pretty easy move them up the laptops and

855
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,819
it's it's a step above right but you get

856
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,299
to Macs and it's like a whole different

857
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:55,040
world so and again they're in such great

858
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,659
demand that we would love to get them

859
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,310
out to our community so many people want

860
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,170
to get into graphic art so they want to

861
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,640
get into those things that the Mac's

862
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,960
really lend themselves to that we can't

863
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,390
we can't bring them out to them

864
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,430
we're common really close on time here

865
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,868
so I can't believe we only asked a

866
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,828
couple of questions and then we got this

867
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:17,450
far I guess the last question I have and

868
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:21,560
I'd really like to hear the entire panel

869
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:23,990
on this is and then I'm gonna open it up

870
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,190
to the to the audience because you may

871
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,500
not have come here to hear about

872
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,550
community and how we're working this you

873
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,740
may have come to hear about how to

874
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:35,690
actually refurbish this stuff but I'd

875
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,450
love to hear what how would you

876
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,750
challenge this or audience what what is

877
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,879
the ask you have in 30 seconds each one

878
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,200
of you what does the ask you have of

879
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,220
this audience what is it that you'd like

880
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,169
for them to take

881
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,310
with them when they go back to the real

882
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,960
world Zack you understand sure when you

883
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,299
go back out there you know feel

884
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,680
emboldened and empowered I think this is

885
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,930
probably true of most the organization's

886
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,580
we started with a hope and a dream you

887
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,440
know no idea how the next month's rent

888
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,090
would be paid or whatever but we all had

889
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,760
a conviction that this was meaningful

890
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,349
and a good thing so if you feel so

891
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,210
inclined find a few people figure out

892
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:12,950
how to pay rent find a cheap place and

893
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,660
start doing what you already do out of

894
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,730
your own closets and and grow it into

895
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,859
something a little bit bigger and if you

896
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,420
can help organizations like ours find

897
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,910
better equipment get into our hands

898
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,040
please do and we'd also love to work

899
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,259
with anybody on legislation around this

900
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,730
right to repair in Arkansas last time I

901
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,400
was shot down by Dell and Apple

902
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,790
there's nothing pending today and we

903
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,410
need some help doing that I just have

904
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,050
some recommendations if you're going to

905
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,299
start one I would highly recommend doing

906
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,940
a community analysis with people like

907
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,170
affected peoples of community Alice's

908
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,790
takes a long time to don't half-ass it

909
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:52,520
when in this process be understanding

910
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:55,720
listen and step back throughout the

911
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,430
whole process be inclusive be welcoming

912
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,319
understand this is community organizing

913
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,509
it's not a computer or tech club and

914
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,440
that this should be your ultimate goal

915
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,970
right to meet human and need never lose

916
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,089
sight of your vision mission or your

917
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,980
purpose of your project ask yourself in

918
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:13,940
every step of the way that you do made

919
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,369
your decision you make it an

920
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,920
organization how is this fitting into

921
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:21,920
what we're setting out to do how is it

922
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,390
furthering it allow as much as possible

923
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,130
service user and marginalized population

924
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,750
leadership and organizing never take

925
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,220
money from a funding source that is

926
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:37,700
going against your mission or your

927
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:40,549
vision and have fun thank you so my

928
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,020
challenge to you is so I am NOT a

929
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,619
technical person I tell people and

930
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,759
technical adjacent technical adjacent

931
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,670
I'm around it but I don't know what I'm

932
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,500
doing with it I have no experience in

933
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,030
the nonprofit sector I've only been

934
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,160
volunteering for two years and as

935
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,830
happenstance and

936
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm doing what I'm doing today so if I

937
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,990
and my fellow volunteers can make an

938
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,819
impact on our community that every

939
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,089
single person in this room is so well

940
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,730
equipped to to help their their fellow

941
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,560
you know neighbors and community members

942
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,690
so I definitely challenge you and even

943
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,180
if it's not you know starting a freak

944
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,400
like organization you know listen out

945
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,529
you know everyone needs help with fixing

946
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,230
their laptop and their devices you know

947
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,430
you can make a difference yeah so I

948
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:28,660
challenge you to look for those

949
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,950
opportunities I think the big thing to

950
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,009
take away is that if you're gonna start

951
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,290
this remember one key thing ask for help

952
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,780
yourself there are lots of things that

953
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,000
you won't know how to do and that there

954
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,760
are already people in the communities or

955
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,790
in large organizations or bureaucracies

956
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,800
who will be you know have a kind ear to

957
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,270
listen to what you want to do and what

958
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,600
you want to support and they can offer

959
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:55,000
guidance and support and intangibles

960
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,190
that are not there you never know you

961
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,650
know in what pockets of area you'll find

962
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,780
somebody who you know knows somebody who

963
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,360
knows somebody who can you know get you

964
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,970
in touch with a landlord who's you know

965
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,920
kind to what you're gonna do or knows a

966
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,450
group that you know can really get you

967
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,250
locked into an actual community that

968
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,950
really could use the services that you

969
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,890
are gonna offer and you know if you're

970
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:20,890
not open to getting help yourself it

971
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,450
will be it it's just it's too much

972
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,990
harder to do it alone you got to do it

973
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,799
with others

974
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:28,060
excellent point you know there are 78

975
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:33,510
nonprofit refurbishers in the United

976
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:36,400
States and free geek is is one of them I

977
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,350
have a call probably once a week I

978
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,900
probably spend one to two hours a week

979
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:42,910
helping other free geeks helping other

980
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,110
nonprofit refurbishers get up and

981
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:50,379
running advising on everything from

982
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:53,230
policies to procedures to you know

983
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,920
trainings to education we freely share

984
00:39:53,230 --> 00:40:00,460
our education curriculums like I said we

985
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,520
do 6,000 hours of Education we share all

986
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,740
of that curriculum we talk about how to

987
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,259
manage the teaching manage the the

988
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,750
volunteers that we have

989
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,270
as a volunteer teachers how to get

990
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:15,500
public schools involved so that you've

991
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:21,210
got places for the children you know our

992
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:25,380
children are remarkably unequipped 60%

993
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:28,350
of the Portland area schools are not

994
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,990
equipped at home in order to do school

995
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,610
work they're their parents can't check

996
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,500
their grades there they can't talk to

997
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:39,450
their teachers homework has always

998
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,610
assigned now online so we talk through

999
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:45,330
how to get involved in that and how to

1000
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,890
get get this information out so if you

1001
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,680
are interested in starting one of these

1002
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,870
up please reach out every one of us

1003
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,700
would feel the phone call every one of

1004
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,790
us would freely share information if

1005
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:59,490
that's what you're interested in doing

1006
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,460
my challenge to you is go back to your

1007
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:04,229
real world if you're working for those

1008
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,990
corporations that are out there or

1009
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:09,960
working for or have a network that

1010
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:13,290
includes that please talk to them about

1011
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,880
what we are trying to do it is a huge

1012
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:20,759
benefit for them from a social social

1013
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,550
networking perspective a corporate

1014
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,770
social responsibility perspective but

1015
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,600
it's also just the right thing to do we

1016
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,120
need to refurbish these things and get

1017
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,700
them out to people that need them so

1018
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,700
that is my challenge to you

1019
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,350
I am almost completely out of time if

1020
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,730
there are any questions from the

1021
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,730
audience please I'd love to hear them

1022
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:49,560
[Applause]

1023
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,560
hi I'm I'm the founder of a company

1024
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:56,700
called Neverwhere and we kind of set out

1025
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,250
to do something similar with with an

1026
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,939
operating system and what we found was

1027
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:07,050
that when we tried giving people linux

1028
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:09,690
there were many people who were very you

1029
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:14,040
know their eyes kind of glazed over and

1030
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:16,650
when we switched to chromium and we told

1031
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,770
people oh hey this is going to turn your

1032
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,120
10 year old computer into a Chromebook

1033
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,570
you know they suddenly connected

1034
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,250
especially in schools where you know

1035
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,450
Google is in every single school

1036
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:34,740
nowadays have you guys you know tried or

1037
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:41,129
had any success with chromium no free

1038
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:42,299
software is so so very important and it

1039
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,180
just takes time you gotta stay with

1040
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,070
people you know and and they'll adopt

1041
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,330
they will yeah yeah I think it's a

1042
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:52,680
little disingenuous to call it a

1043
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:56,670
Chromebook also just a comment we we

1044
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,370
distribute Linux on all of our computers

1045
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:02,190
that we put out we've recently become a

1046
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:05,100
Microsoft authorized refurbisher

1047
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,800
as well and the reason that we've done

1048
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,089
that is because a lot of our folks that

1049
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,680
we're helping get back into the

1050
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,300
workforce when they get back into the

1051
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:18,029
workforce they need to have at that

1052
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:21,180
Microsoft experience it causes havoc in

1053
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,830
the shop with all the drivers you've got

1054
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,660
to have and the updates we've got to

1055
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:27,090
have and the virus where you've got to

1056
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,640
have I mean but and and we try and

1057
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,120
explain Linux is on the space station I

1058
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,569
think they know what they're doing

1059
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,759
[Laughter]

1060
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:40,779
and most of our people do accept Linux

1061
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:45,339
as we put it out yeah

1062
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm sorry we do we have to every Mac we

1063
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:50,680
sell it I guess so when I was in school

1064
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,799
I volunteered at the Cincinnati computer

1065
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,470
cooperative the other CCC and we did a

1066
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:59,440
lot of e-waste recycling we had a lot of

1067
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,819
problems where we would just you know

1068
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,559
we'd get huge pallets of computers

1069
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,029
especially those macs that are

1070
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,730
impossible to take apart and get the

1071
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:08,019
hard drive out of them but a lot of the

1072
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,190
computers that we'd refurbish and we'd

1073
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,390
even put Windows on them occasionally

1074
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,819
because that's what people are used to

1075
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,980
we couldn't sell them you know it was

1076
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:17,049
things were too slow for people at what

1077
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,470
point do you determine when something

1078
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:24,400
needs to be recycled versus you know

1079
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,589
sold or given to people how do you make

1080
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,029
have the discussion also if you have

1081
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:29,170
time like what's the weirdest thing that

1082
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:32,140
you've gotten in we got a lot of weird

1083
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,999
stuff yeah that's an ongoing thing so so

1084
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,950
we've had this issue at free Gargan saw

1085
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:37,390
quite a bit we had a hard time we were

1086
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,848
early on getting things that were

1087
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,109
performant at all but we were lucky

1088
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,999
enough to have enough equipment to draw

1089
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:45,609
from now that our benchmark is if

1090
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:47,709
YouTube is not a slideshow yeah it's an

1091
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:49,210
effective machine all right if you can

1092
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,190
learn from videos on the internet

1093
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,799
publicly posted by other people that's

1094
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,970
good enough yeah we do the same thing we

1095
00:44:53,799 --> 00:45:01,299
evaluate our spec probably monthly and

1096
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:07,058
right now we're at i5 or i7 and above 8

1097
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:08,529
gigs but you know what we do with

1098
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:11,079
everything else that we get is we

1099
00:45:08,529 --> 00:45:12,279
palletize it and we put it back out ok

1100
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,799
so we're able to get it to other

1101
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:17,259
refurbishers that that are able to to

1102
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:19,269
take on that much we just get too many

1103
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:21,130
systems we can't we can't possibly push

1104
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:24,640
them around yes we're at core to our

1105
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:27,970
bust core to do is here - yeah we're

1106
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,788
just a Mac Mini that's still up and

1107
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:34,238
running today

1108
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:37,900
PPC Linux and we do get very cool stuff

1109
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:40,750
in a lot of like the read-back Macs

1110
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,120
and we get a lot of ham radio we get a

1111
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,910
lot of vintage radio we've got

1112
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,279
relationships with clubs throughout the

1113
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:51,100
United States that are vintage clubs

1114
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,320
that take on Commodores of all things

1115
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,710
yeah it's it's kind of amazing this

1116
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:01,330
stuff we get in I got a computer with

1117
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:03,070
roaches once this this woman came back

1118
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:04,360
with roaches again which I just gave her

1119
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,460
another computer it was like whatever

1120
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,070
got an extra one make sure you get it

1121
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:11,800
but this led to trying to find out like

1122
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,690
where this person was living you know

1123
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,760
and checking up on them and saying like

1124
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,760
and the place was in a really bad shape

1125
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,110
so there are avenues to that you don't

1126
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,720
even expect to to happen through just a

1127
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:28,870
computer yep yeah top to top gun'

1128
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:32,759
joystick as my coolest I got yeah we've

1129
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,759
gotten we've gotten like live beehives

1130
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:40,890
we've gotten alcohol

1131
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:45,070
we've gotten guns bullets not guns

1132
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:46,900
bullets as well not so much a question

1133
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,930
more of a comments that was recently

1134
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,210
ruling from the FTC about warranties and

1135
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,089
the warranty stickers was back in either

1136
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:56,230
April or May that the don't only the

1137
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,930
stickers meaningless but they're also

1138
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,400
illegal

1139
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:03,629
the various companies that were named in

1140
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,550
the suit were Microsoft Nintendo HTC and

1141
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:12,520
I forget what the other so I stole my

1142
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:15,160
Sony I know but Apple wasn't named in it

1143
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,450
I'm sure FTC is probably looking at them

1144
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,390
too and I know if you guys have any

1145
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:25,720
comments on that

1146
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:27,910
as far as right to repair I mean the the

1147
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,459
few Mac's that we've repaired that might

1148
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:32,950
have still had warranty status never

1149
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,360
then had their warranty exercised after

1150
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,950
the fact so we have no real direct

1151
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,930
knowledge usually by the time we see

1152
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,450
them there there's no warranty still

1153
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,210
hanging so yeah that's usually true for

1154
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,460
us too yeah we we give six months of

1155
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,590
free tech support for anything that's

1156
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,359
purchased from our store online we do

1157
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:52,930
one year of service

1158
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:57,160
for anything that we donate or grant to

1159
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:59,288
others yeah so that kind of makes that

1160
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,868
go away for us so there's often a

1161
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:04,839
trade-off between speed and old machines

1162
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:07,599
and usability and use of use you

1163
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,709
mentioned lube unto is that what most of

1164
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,450
you have come down on or is just

1165
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:14,799
wondering that what destroys you've

1166
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:16,269
picked we used it for a register for

1167
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:18,819
awhile because the slowest machine in

1168
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:20,919
the whole building but we stand on

1169
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:22,930
ubuntu we try to stay on the latest LTS

1170
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,369
as much as we can it depends on hardware

1171
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:33,759
compatibility Linux Mint because it

1172
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:35,799
looks like Windows it's like it's so

1173
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:38,229
because it does everything it looks the

1174
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,910
exact same people like the barrier to

1175
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:43,359
entry on it is they just think it's a

1176
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:45,399
green theme no no no it's actually

1177
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,650
something else but yeah so Linux Mint I

1178
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,930
think we're on we just were on 18 - we

1179
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:52,930
haven't got a 19 yet yep we're on 18 as

1180
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:55,979
well yeah Ubuntu was a free IT choice

1181
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:59,019
because the ones who started the Amazon

1182
00:48:55,979 --> 00:49:00,819
spy thing so we wanted to get away from

1183
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,558
an interface that had that as a default

1184
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:05,229
that was a decision why we use like a

1185
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:12,699
different desktop environment and it's

1186
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:15,160
lighter yeah so I guess that's a good

1187
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:18,640
segue into my question so I'm curious

1188
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,709
about how you guys balance usability

1189
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,009
with getting people into the sort of

1190
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:26,049
panopticon of Google and you know this

1191
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:27,670
sort of and how do you deal with that in

1192
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,499
terms of harm reduction like where do

1193
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,849
you draw the lines how do you struggle

1194
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:35,049
with it if you know what I mean yeah

1195
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:36,699
could you example you can help people

1196
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:38,259
get into a computer but then they can

1197
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:40,630
quickly sort of get subsumed in

1198
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:41,920
advertising and being tracked and sort

1199
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,920
of have all these other problems that

1200
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,430
are really counter to the ethos of free

1201
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,509
software and freezing Liberty just maybe

1202
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,969
you don't struggle with it at all

1203
00:49:49,509 --> 00:49:56,049
no I'll speak in Portland at first if

1204
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:58,569
you guys want we give classes on that so

1205
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:59,770
part of our when you come through and

1206
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:02,100
you you are given a

1207
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:06,009
computer or you're getting started class

1208
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:09,160
includes a whole section on security as

1209
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,300
well as how to safely navigate the

1210
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,370
Internet

1211
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,310
and that's that's the way that we try to

1212
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:16,509
do it is through education yeah yeah we

1213
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,370
try to do it through education as well

1214
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:20,800
most of ours is informal rather than

1215
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:22,150
formal but we do as much as we can with

1216
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,010
with new users getting their first

1217
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,660
computers to at least let them know that

1218
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,700
they should look further into these

1219
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,220
things and don't just click accept on

1220
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,899
Terms of Service I know they're daunting

1221
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,980
but they're at least worth a read and if

1222
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,530
it makes you want to throw up once

1223
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,720
probably say no I'm sorry you have to

1224
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,860
wrap this up but for everyone in our

1225
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,140
audience and everybody who's gonna be

1226
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,120

1227
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,310
and who's everybody's there watching the

1228
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,130
live stream now how can people get more

1229
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:50,680
