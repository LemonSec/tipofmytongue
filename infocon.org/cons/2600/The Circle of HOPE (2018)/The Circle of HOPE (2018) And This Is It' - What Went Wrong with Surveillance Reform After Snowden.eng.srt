1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
a quick show of hands about how many

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,189
people were outraged when they read

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,340
about what the intelligence community

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,750
was doing with the that we found out

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,400
about with the Snowden leaks I can't see

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,559
anybody because I am being blinded

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,100
buying light but I am seeing movement

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,289
and I feel like a Tyrannosaurus Rex now

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,390
so lots of outrage right who feels like

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,699
after five years of hard work and

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,849
millions of dollars put into the privacy

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,439
community and all of the times you have

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,970
called your members of Congress and sent

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,650
emails to them and taken to the streets

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,629
that we've we've solved it right like

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,860
we're good right

17
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:40,950
no nothing all right so in in June of

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,480
2015 which is two years after the first

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,600
of the Snowden leaks were published

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,279
former NSA director Michael Hayden

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,260
describes his reaction to changes made

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,180
to the telephone metadata dragnet

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,010
program by the recently passed USA

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,480
Freedom Act

25
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,399
Michael Hayden said and I'm quoting here

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,140
and this is it after two years cool

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
there were a lot of dramatic changes

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,840
after the Snowden leaks five years ago

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,630
which I think I don't need to reiterate

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,490
to this crowd about and and encryption

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,929
changes and behavior changes and

32
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,830
perceptions about mass surveillance and

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,900
so on and so forth

34
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,119
but what did not result from the Snowden

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,040
leaks was any meaningful limitations on

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,140
the scope or extent of mass surveillance

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,810
by the intelligence communities in the

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,150
United States exacerbating this there

39
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,640
have has not been a public let alone a

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,100
private debate as to why congressional

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,810
reform achieved since Snowden which the

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,329
short version are the USA Freedom Act

43
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,590
which revised and reauthorized parts of

44
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,589
the Patriot Act including the phone

45
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,220
metadata dragnet and the FISA Amendments

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,350
reauthorization Act of 215 of 2017 which

47
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,119
to give you an idea of the dysfunction

48
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,908
that we're facing that was passed into

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,970
that was an 18 despite having 2017 in

50
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,979
the name which reauthorized the FISA

51
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,720
Amendments Act covering the now renamed

52
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,909
prism surveillance program and other

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,979
programs these have not meaningfully

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,990
decreased either the amount of

55
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,079
surveillance that has taken place or the

56
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,339
uses that it's been put to before I

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,110
begin this panel I want to caveat

58
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,310
everything by said that I'm going to be

59
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,940
saying that the panelists here are gonna

60
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,830
be saying by by talking about the title

61
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,240
of the panel which is the phrase what

62
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,150
went wrong with surveillance reform

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,700
since Newton this is a provocative title

64
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,290
admittedly there have been changes and

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,640
we'll talk about some of them although

66
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,040
with the time limitations we won't get

67
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,320
to all of them however if your goals

68
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,640
which I think all of my panelists here

69
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,799
and myself and everybody in this room

70
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,350
shares are to one limit the amount of

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,600
surveillance conducted or its use or to

72
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,700
to position ourselves so that in the

73
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,859
near future we can limit the amount of

74
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,260
surveillance or is use its uses we've

75
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,970
not succeeded despite immense amounts of

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,320
public pressure despite millions of

77
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,510
dollars invested into the privacy

78
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,790
community in order to reform

79
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,870
surveillance at the national level so

80
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,239
our goal to start this conversation

81
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,459
about what needs to change to curtail

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,140
mass surveillance at a pace that matches

83
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,300
the frightening rise of authoritarian

84
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,070
ideologies which will foreclose on the

85
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,690
possibility of a free society if given

86
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,180
the opportunity and the tools in the

87
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,750
infrastructure with which to do so with

88
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,520
me to jumpstart that debate today are

89
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,920
Alex Marth use of restore the fourth

90
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,930
which is a 501 C 4 nonprofit dedicated

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,600
to ending unconstitutional mass

92
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,280
surveillance marcy wheeler and

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,260
independent national security and civil

94
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,380
liberties reporter whose writings can be

95
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,149
found regularly at empty wheels next and

96
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,739
all the way at the end we've got Sean

97
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,300
vitka who lobbies Congress on

98
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,190
surveillance and Internet freedom issues

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,320
for demand progress moderating the

100
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,359
panelists myself jeff land element in an

101
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,950
independent Internet freedom organizer

102
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,530
and researcher I've worked with access

103
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,380
now the New America Foundation xlab and

104
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,760
demand progress we don't have a ton of

105
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,030
time so we're gonna try to cover a

106
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,540
five-year period in 45 minutes now maybe

107
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,030
less to get some questions in so the

108
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,470
prerequisite to legislative reforms to

109
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,540
surveillance is to understand what

110
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,489
surveillance is actually occurring and

111
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,290
under what authorities and regulations

112
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,209
in order to be able to change those

113
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,890
authorities and regulations and put a

114
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,600
stop to the unconstitutional mass

115
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,429
surveillance that we've been aware of

116
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,920
for five years or if you were reading

117
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,080
about Mike mark Klein more than five

118
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,089
years or if you remember COINTELPRO for

119
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,820
many many decades so my first question

120
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,620
is to Marcy Marcy what are some of the

121
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,450
failures that you've seen in the policy

122
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,919
community to understand what

123
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,099
surveillance is actually happening

124
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,039
what's being overlooked and why aren't

125
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,990
we finding these issues um I recently

126
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,090
had a conversation with Bob litt for

127
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,919
those who don't know he's the general

128
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,099
counsel the former general counsel of

129
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,109
odni who advised James clapper back in

130
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,210
2013 it was a good idea to answer Ron

131
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,640
Weyden's question about whether the

132
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,810
government was collecting on millions of

133
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,419
Americans not wittingly so I went to Bob

134
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,760
recently and I said Bob I think you had

135
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,760
a strategy of burying the privacy

136
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,010
community and transparency and by that I

137
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,190
mean in addition to the Snowden

138
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,590
documents which few people in in the DC

139
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,800
policy community of read the the

140
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,530
government released a ton of documents

141
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,110
some of which are enormous ly helpful to

142
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,140
explain what was actually going on with

143
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:19,710
the phone dragnet and with 702 the what

144
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:24,450
you may know as prism and and nobody

145
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,700
read it and so I said to Bob did you

146
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,590
bury them on purpose and he's like well

147
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,360
it's like any analytical thing sometimes

148
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,219
it's really hard to find the diamond in

149
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,729
the rough and he kind of turtled because

150
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,810
he's like that instead of reading those

151
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:42,419
documents what the what the odni did at

152
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,729
the same time was kind of embraced the

153
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,010
privacy community and invite them to the

154
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:50,159
table and so rather than reading the

155
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,169
documents that were a response to

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,030
Snowden that and therefore were part of

157
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:58,280
what Snowden basically risked his life

158
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,119
to give us the privacy Cumaean DC

159
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,099
enthusiastically sat down at a table

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,280
with Alex Joel who's part of odni

161
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:08,130
supposingly the privacy officer and let

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,590
him tell them what was going on rather

163
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:14,580
than reading the documents Thank You

164
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:16,260
Marci a follow-up for you I think is is

165
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,450
this an issue of the quality of the

166
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,180
analysts or their structural issues why

167
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,710
where entire institutions and

168
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,099
organizations which have offices

169
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,930
dedicated to this are not able to sift

170
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,340
through the amount of information and

171
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,690
transparency that they're getting in

172
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,060
order to come to a solid understanding

173
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,180
of what's going on I think there's a

174
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,879
theory among the privacy community in DC

175
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,909
many of whom are lawyers that

176
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,520
if seven JD's sit down in a room and

177
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:46,860
read the statute they will understand

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,339
what's going on what actually needs to

179
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,619
happen at least in my experience is

180
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:55,110
people who don't need JD's I don't have

181
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:58,169
a JD I do have a PhD but I don't have a

182
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,879
JD need to sit down and read the

183
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:02,580
minimization procedures which are

184
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,110
basically where Fiske tells the

185
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,669
government what they're allowed to do

186
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,819
before an Intelligence Surveillance

187
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,139
Court yeah something like that and and

188
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,159
that never happened

189
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,929
so there are lawyers in New York the the

190
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,789
I mean there are the only other people

191
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,289
who I know of who've read all of the

192
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,709
documents that were released by OD and I

193
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,199
are some ACLU lawyers litigators here in

194
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,339
New York I know of no other people in

195
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,229
the country with the possible exception

196
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,249
well with the exception of Laura Donohue

197
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,899
who's now Fisk amicus I know of no other

198
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:37,319
people in the country who've read these

199
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,839
documents instead some lawyers sit down

200
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,669
and read the law and as a result don't

201
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,459
understand what's really going on behind

202
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,829
the law Thank You Marcy my next question

203
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,229
is to Sean we're getting legislative

204
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,249
proposals that overlook the actual

205
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,169
functioning of surveillance

206
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,939
infrastructure both legally and

207
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,188
technologically and which aren't going

208
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,699
far enough to inspire that many people

209
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:03,089
to get involved to get a bill passed

210
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:07,949
what's going on in in Congress where

211
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:11,819
we're getting bills that's a great

212
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,990
question so I'm gonna tell a story I

213
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,789
think about the FISA man ministry

214
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,199
Authorization Act if that makes sense

215
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:21,568
Jeff yep we we just lost in a major way

216
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,269
earlier this year the FISA Ministry

217
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,419
authorization after 2017 became law

218
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:29,999
there is a very complicated process that

219
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,218
goes into it and it really predates the

220
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:36,389
702 fight again this is what authorizes

221
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,099
prism and upstream it's born from the

222
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,299
USA freedom debate which if you're not

223
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,729
familiar with I would recommend checking

224
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:45,209
out Marcis readings but to abbreviate

225
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,069
this let's start at the end of it we in

226
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:49,260
the privacy community often considered

227
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,420
the us a freedom debate to be kind of

228
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,019
the precursor to 702 because

229
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:58,639
as bad as that bulk metadata dragnet was

230
00:08:54,019 --> 00:09:02,060
the use of prism and upstream was was

231
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:05,310
for me at least much more disturbing so

232
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,279
we worked really hard on this and we

233
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,199
started out very early trying to meet

234
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,060
with the intelligence community me with

235
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,599
the administration meet with every

236
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,888
member of Congress would possibly could

237
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,070
at the end of the day the people on the

238
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:22,470
hill decided that in the interest of

239
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,060
making sure that a bill that they were

240
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,699
working on theoretically to reform it

241
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,518
would get a vote in committee which is a

242
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:31,469
necessary step more or less that they

243
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
would have to work with Bob Goodlatte so

244
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,699
chairman Goodlatte is is the chairman of

245
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,350
the Judiciary Committee and under no

246
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:40,709
circumstances would he be considered in

247
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,019
how I have reformed so at the outset we

248
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:47,479
had a very difficult question and I

249
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:50,010
think we answered it wrong we had

250
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,720
somebody like Bob Goodlatte in the room

251
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,120
deciding what reform was going to go to

252
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,769
the floor now from the perspective of

253
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,620
what can we actually get and have a

254
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:00,360
debate over in committee there's some

255
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,110
sense to that he's the chairman if he's

256
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,750
on board he can push it the problem is

257
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,640
that it robs the the the grassroots it

258
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,779
robs the activists of the opportunity to

259
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,880
actually hold members accountable

260
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,279
because suddenly the only reform bill

261
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,769
that had been seriously worked on and

262
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,870
vetted ends up being the USA Liberty Act

263
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,050
which I'm gonna use parlance here

264
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,790
doesn't successfully add introduction

265
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,240
close the backdoor search loophole which

266
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,439
was the foundational the the Archstone

267
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,699
of reform for for us for a long time and

268
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,730
there was a scramble and we didn't we

269
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:42,390
were stuck with an unfortunate choice do

270
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,699
we abandon ship do we leave the only

271
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,839
bill that seems to have path forward and

272
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:50,899
if so what do we do some of us did and

273
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,350
demand progress I'm happy to say

274
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,050
absolutely said that it was an

275
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,760
unacceptable bill we end up eventually

276
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,529
getting something called the USA Rights

277
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,680
Act not introduced in committee but

278
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,130
introduced by senators Wyden and Paul

279
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,199
and

280
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,600
also in the house USA Rights Act was

281
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,010
kind of a gold standard reform bill but

282
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,240
everybody told us we could never get a

283
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,350
vote on it eventually you end up with us

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,030
a Liberty getting steamrolled by

285
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,070
leadership and said the intelligence

286
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,050
community writes a bill with the House

287
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,670
Intelligence Committee our good friend

288
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,439
Devin Nunez and they just completely

289
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,290
steamrolled the Judiciary Committee and

290
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,700
their bill goes to the floor instead so

291
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,160
you say Liberty never gets a vote it

292
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,310
does an extremely quiet death after

293
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,280
passing out of judiciary so a lot of

294
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,109
good it did us organizing and spending

295
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,760
all that time working on this bill in

296
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,910
tandem with one of our greatest

297
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:52,420
opponents which is chairman Goodlatte so

298
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,219
that ends up becoming law and that the

299
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,040
FISA Amendments reauthorization Act ends

300
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,340
up expanding the use for instance of 702

301
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,280
in court against defendants who aren't

302
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,720
you know accused of terrorism or or

303
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,030
something else you can now use it for

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,730
international narcotics it's a pretty

305
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,500
dramatic problem but we did have this

306
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,630
one glimmer of hope right before that

307
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,120
vote some of our allies on the hill

308
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,280
managed to get a promise for a vote on

309
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,350
the USA Rights Act and so suddenly this

310
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,600
bill that was the gold standard and that

311
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,380
nobody that everybody was telling us we

312
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,670
couldn't possibly get a vote for gets a

313
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,140
hundred and eighty three votes as a

314
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,040
replacement to the FISA -

315
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,960
reauthorization act you need to 18 183

316
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,800
isn't super close but that's a winnable

317
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,060
fight but we had never done we had done

318
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,620
an inadequate job of laying the

319
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,349
groundwork to get that bill passed and

320
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,410
so we went from a situation where we

321
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,990
almost had every reform we wanted to an

322
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,610
actual degradation of the status quo

323
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,920
Thank You Sean and when you say that

324
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,410
everyone was saying that the USA Rights

325
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,719
Act which came reasonably close to

326
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,100
passing couldn't pass that's including

327
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,350
members of the privacy reform community

328
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,210
correct yeah I I we we had a letter that

329
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,780
to support the USA Rights Act and some

330
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,890
organizations actually one in particular

331
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,910
explicitly said that they they wouldn't

332
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,140
sign on because

333
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,360
they just didn't think it was worth the

334
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,520
time thank you Alex

335
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,040
excuse me thank you Sean my next

336
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,480
question is to Alex Alex you spend a lot

337
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,910
of time organizing at the grassroots

338
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,240
level you are not based in DC so you're

339
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,160
not boned into some of the same

340
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,930
stringent requirements that those of us

341
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,780
there sometimes face do you do you what

342
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,459
are your thoughts on why the grassroots

343
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,170
isn't showing up in the same way that

344
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,600
perhaps it has for the sopa/pipa fight

345
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,729
or for net neutrality why aren't we

346
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,010
seeing if not people taking to the

347
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,900
streets necessarily but the same level

348
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,450
of constituent mobilization and phone

349
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,540
calls and emails being driven in support

350
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:03,100
of the bills that are being put forward

351
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:07,719
in Congress I think to me it seems a

352
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:10,180
relatively simple analysis I know why I

353
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,760
am involved in grassroots organizing and

354
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,949
I know a lot of people who are involved

355
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,050
in surveillance organizing and I have

356
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,590
some notion of why they're involved and

357
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:24,359
as you said at the top of the panel what

358
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:28,600
motivates us is trying to decrease

359
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,000
surveillance having more transparency is

360
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,570
nice it can be ins an instrument towards

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,760
that goal but what motivates us is

362
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,430
measures that will decrease surveillance

363
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:46,600
and that is why we put in the hours that

364
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:52,050
we do and it seems absurd to pursue a

365
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,450
strategy that is so much focused on what

366
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:59,650
individual gatekeepers in DC will accept

367
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:02,200
that you're implicitly promising it on

368
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,689
being able to mobilize your own members

369
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,460
and be mobile able to mobilize people to

370
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,560
call him but people won't call in if

371
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,130
they don't care and they won't care if

372
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,150
what if what they're offered is

373
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:17,770
something that is at best a maintenance

374
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,630
of the status quo with additional

375
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,530
transparency and at worse an actual

376
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:26,770
worsening of the status quo the there's

377
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,480
a lot of obfuscation in this area

378
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,189
there's a lot of complex

379
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,310
city and grassroots activists in the

380
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:39,310
Maine are wanting to have a cause for

381
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:43,630
fight to fight for and that poses a

382
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:49,060
difficulty I think that part of what we

383
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:51,939
also see is that there was an over

384
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,888
valuing of the power of this particular

385
00:15:51,940 --> 00:16:00,550
gatekeeper and an assumption that Bob

386
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:02,769
Goodlatte would be able to get not only

387
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,740
a bill discussed in committee but would

388
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,990
be able to have enough influence over

389
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,660
leadership to have it receive a vote on

390
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,300
the floor that would be a reasonable

391
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:17,709
vote and that it would have a chance of

392
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:21,969
passage and I think nobody among the

393
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:24,250
people who were focusing on Congress was

394
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,959
really thinking about how that would be

395
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,329
the case and how that would be the case

396
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,479
is through grassroots pressure it takes

397
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:33,939
thousands of course it takes tens of

398
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,589
thousands and there needs to be a

399
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,370
tapping into that energy and a

400
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:41,350
respecting of that energy thank you Alex

401
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,970
I think this is this next question as to

402
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,620
all three panelists and you can answer

403
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,529
it perhaps rapid-fire if you want to go

404
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,449
into more detail as well but how do you

405
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,459
respond to the argument that if we can't

406
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,709
even get this incremental change if we

407
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,869
can't get the u.s. saying Liberty Act

408
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:59,888
which dies in committee and never gets a

409
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,959
four vote how how are we supposed to be

410
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:06,429
able to get even bigger and bolder and

411
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:08,500
more comprehensive changes let's take a

412
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:13,240
first crack so on top of surveillance I

413
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:17,770
also handled net neutrality and it is

414
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:23,530
night and day looking at the - one is a

415
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:28,840
robust popular movement and it allows us

416
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,970
on the hill to choose our allies choose

417
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,730
who's going to lead the fight to make

418
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:37,270
demands and to force people to go on

419
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:40,000
record if you have a bill that shows up

420
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,350
in the middle you never really get to

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,240
ask the question are you Pro

422
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,270
warrantless surveillance under Donald

423
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,120
Trump or not that's the question we

424
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,460
needed to be asking I'll highlight

425
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,049
actually the the worst moment in my

426
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,690
opinion of the FISA Amendments

427
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:58,870
reauthorization fight which was during

428
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,690
the House floor debate when USA rights

429
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,949
was being voted on and Minority Leader

430
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,010
Nancy Pelosi with the strong backing of

431
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,200
ranking member Adam Schiff they took the

432
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,658
floor and urged their members to vote

433
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,070
against us a rights in other words to

434
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,470
preserve warrantless surveillance under

435
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,340
Donald Trump again we ended up with a

436
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,480
hundred eighty three votes but we had

437
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,600
representative Pelosi and representative

438
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,370
Schiff pretty much at the end dominate

439
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,100
for the last ten minutes of debate time

440
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:39,219
urging Democrats and everybody to not

441
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:41,918
pass us a rights so if we end up in that

442
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,929
situation and we've had a middling

443
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,130
debate or debate about a middling bill

444
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:50,890
like the USA Liberty Act we can't go we

445
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:54,880
don't have the the groundwork laid we

446
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,409
can't take that razor to the to the

447
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,230
fight and say which side of the star you

448
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,240
want and instead we find out at the last

449
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,860
second that somebody who should be

450
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,200
whipping very aggressively in our favor

451
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,860
is actually going to shoot us in the

452
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,659
foot you know and I'll jump in on this

453
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,520
part of the problem without about not

454
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:17,289
laying out what is actually being done

455
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,539
is that I last year in October covered

456
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,740
what I now call the Tor exception it's

457
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:27,340
it's a secret application of section 702

458
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:32,380
that accesses location obscured servers

459
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:35,020
and keeps is allowed to do that even if

460
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:39,159
US persons are using the servers like

461
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:42,639
tor so long as the NSA gets rid of the

462
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,620
US person content after the fact but

463
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,690
there are eight as Sean said there are

464
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,360
eight enumerated crimes some of them are

465
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,700
you know bad like like murder and and

466
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,990
and kidnapping and some of the in child

467
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,860
porn and

468
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,580
of them are crimes that are

469
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,320
traditionally misunder

470
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:05,189
miss broadly expanded meaning

471
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,320
trafficking which is often sex work and

472
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:12,730
CFAA Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which

473
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:17,620
is often activism and so the government

474
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:20,050
can now keep stuff from the dark web and

475
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,169
the bill actually codified it such that

476
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,280
in addition to these eight crimes

477
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,809
anything that the attorney general

478
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:31,780
meaning Jeff Sessions Dean's a national

479
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:34,090
security issue so something like say BLM

480
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,210
black lives matter they can also keep

481
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:43,090
that under the law as passed last year

482
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:45,730
now I covered that and and I it was a

483
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,500
very difficult story to write I covered

484
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,650
that the bribes give me pretty much blew

485
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,990
it off blew it off and so instead of

486
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,780
saying Nancy Pelosi is about to vote is

487
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,929
about to whip to give Jeff Sessions the

488
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,970
authority to decide to spy on black

489
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,660
lives matter in the name of foreign

490
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:07,000
surveillance instead of holding Nancy

491
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,000
Pelosi accountable for whipping for that

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,710
bill we instead were kind of wishy

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,929
washing talking about going after

494
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,880
terrorists and that's the importance of

495
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,190
being really honest about what these

496
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,010
surveillance programs do because Nancy

497
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,280
Pelosi was able to pretend that what she

498
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,570
did wasn't giving Jeff Sessions

499
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,370
unreviewable authority to use these

500
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,409
servant to use these surveillance tools

501
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,909
against Americans and the bill literally

502
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,150
says there's no judicial review of the

503
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,500
Attorney General's decision by the way

504
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,630
Marcie you've had some other experiences

505
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,710
as well with the privacy community

506
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:43,330
perhaps sidelining or actively pushing

507
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,980
you out of the conversation when you

508
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:50,500
raise criticisms of the bills that they

509
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:53,020
are rallying around yes well I mean look

510
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,510
you know I I can be a jerk I admit it

511
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,460
and and I can be strident about what I

512
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,340
believe these things to do but I now you

513
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,050
know I guessed in 2009 about the phone

514
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,149
dragnet four years before Edward Snowden

515
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,290
and started a leak investigation because

516
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,490
people thought that there was no way I

517
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,230
could just guess it

518
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,840
I have a very good track record on this

519
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:14,470
but you know I don't have a JD so I

520
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,290
think people in DC don't like girls from

521
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,640
Michigan beat stridently saying you need

522
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,059
to listen to what the surveillance is

523
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,929
actually doing because it ruffles

524
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,080
feathers I guess some of us do just just

525
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:32,380
not enough I think that's the polite

526
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:36,428
answer from Marcy this time around get

527
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,300
me drunk later enough so Alex you have

528
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:41,980
do you have any any thoughts about why

529
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,520
being able to achieve bolder and more

530
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,650
comprehensive reform may be a potential

531
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,230
route I'm definitely leading you on with

532
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:53,260
this question towards success rather

533
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,790
than middling in an incremental reform

534
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:01,660
that we've seen over the past five years

535
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:05,070
I think that to an extent the importance

536
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:10,690
is the choice set that you offer

537
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:13,689
Congress I wish that Congress were the

538
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,740
kind of deliberative body that it is in

539
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,660
the imaginations of people who work with

540
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,429
these folks day to day and who have to

541
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:28,570
assume that they are motivated by things

542
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:33,450
like rationality but Congress is a body

543
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:37,870
in deep disarray motivated by crisis

544
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:40,720
that has real difficulty in getting

545
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,909
anything done at all and when it does

546
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,190
something it does something when it is

547
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:51,730
desperate as a result the important

548
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,130
thing is not to give congressional

549
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,740
leadership stuff that they can get away

550
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,809
with it's not to come in as the

551
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,170
reasonable person in the room and to

552
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,840
come with a predigested compromise that

553
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:09,610
you think may just about be okay with

554
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:12,100
the people who like you you have to

555
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:15,459
present them with the catastrophic

556
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:18,469
alternatives in their minds of letting

557
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,769
surveillance authorities lapse entirely

558
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:25,809
or giving them deep reform giving us

559
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:28,519
deeper form and so I think that privacy

560
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:34,100
organizations need to be very skeptical

561
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:36,019
about presenting to lawmakers something

562
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,759
moderate that they have sat down with

563
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,320
the intelligence community with and the

564
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,110
intelligence community has signed off

565
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:46,009
upon that is really not our job we are

566
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:48,229
advocates we are representing people who

567
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,730
deeply care about freedom from

568
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:55,129
surveillance and the bills that we

569
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:58,659
present need to deeply care now Congress

570
00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:01,370
is more chaotic than it has been the

571
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:04,309
politics of this are more scrambled than

572
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:10,729
they have been and President chaos

573
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:16,789
monkey re scrambles the situation week

574
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:20,080
on week so we cannot as maybe we might

575
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:23,419
have been able to do 20 or 30 years ago

576
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,120
reliably point to somebody like trey

577
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,620
Gowdy and say oh we think he's going to

578
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,049
vote this way on this because they are

579
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,029
so guided by what they think will piss

580
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:35,750
off the president and what will not and

581
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:38,679
who knows week on week what will present

582
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:44,029
or not I mean nobody knows that presents

583
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:46,759
opportunities for us as a coalition to

584
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:50,529
gum things up to prevent Congress from

585
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:54,409
doing more damage than it already has

586
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:56,419
but also in the interstices where

587
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:58,070
Congress is not rationally debating

588
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:04,299
which is probably the majority of its

589
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:07,490
time to push through solutions that if

590
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,370
push comes to shove they will feel

591
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,870
desperate enough to pass this whole

592
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,799
thing about the expiration of

593
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:18,799
surveillance authorities it is not our

594
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,408
problem to solve the expiration of

595
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,679
surveillance authorities is a good thing

596
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:27,200
and if it happens then that is good for

597
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,570
us so we should not be coming to them

598
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,380
and saying we will solve this problem

599
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,080
for you let them

600
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,050
explain what they want to do and let's

601
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,710
present what should be done instead

602
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,379
thank you Alex

603
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,780
Jeff do you mind if I yeah jump in so I

604
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,550
think strongly agree with it Alex just

605
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,830
said this conversation and what Alex

606
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:53,930
just said point very specifically to to

607
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:57,840
a theory of change question and the

608
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,340
prime motivator for a member of Congress

609
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,629
for most members of Congress there are

610
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,949
definitely some principled ones

611
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,570
unfortunately there are principled ones

612
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,990
on both sides it's the common welfare

613
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,540
right that's the motive it's fear it's

614
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:12,450
fear of losing an election it's fear of

615
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,909
pissing off their constituents this is

616
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,060
why having something that mobilizes

617
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:23,910
grassroots is so critical and if we take

618
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:28,440
the principle that that's our primary

619
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:30,780
leverage and play it out then the

620
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,830
presence of immense grassroots pressure

621
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,629
is critical it's the thing it's the fuel

622
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:40,590
just the car doesn't move otherwise and

623
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:42,150
I fear again this has become for me very

624
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:52,730
night and day working between net

625
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:55,770
neutrality and surveillance if we need

626
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,690
members of Congress who will be

627
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,670
champions and will fight to the hilt and

628
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,740
to get those you have to pick the right

629
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,290
allies and you have to do the same and

630
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,510
you have to find out who's gonna go

631
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:11,040
which way you have to present them with

632
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:12,629
that binary choice that theory doesn't

633
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,730
seem to hold up in the surveillance

634
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,660
community on net neutrality I don't know

635
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,580
if anybody's following the California

636
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,460
net neutrality bill for instance but we

637
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,840
had a row with with Miguel Santiago who

638
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,320
was the the chairman of one of the

639
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,389
committees he attempted to gut what

640
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,909
seems to be on its way to becoming the

641
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:34,440
strongest net neutrality bill in the

642
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,820
country he backed off real quick once it

643
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,420
turned out somebody was thinking about

644
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,970
putting up billboards in his district we

645
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,460
need to fight like hell and I don't

646
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,620
think that's what's happening instead

647
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,940
what's happening our conversations where

648
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:52,370
we are ascending to chairman Goodlatte

649
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,149
being a necessary party to him being on

650
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,399
the bill to him signing off we are

651
00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:01,158
accepting the idea that the people who

652
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,320
do my job and I will say the people who

653
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,990
do my job are unfortunately pretty

654
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,080
strapped for time and capacity it is its

655
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,029
own issue but we're not there to

656
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,379
negotiate we're there to find the right

657
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,510
allies and to make sure they're as

658
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,490
powerful as possible when they have to

659
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,700
negotiate and that requires all of you

660
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,020
and all of our grassroots members

661
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,760
instead the conversation that seems to

662
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,590
happen is is one that accepts that we're

663
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,610
gonna play the game their way as Alex

664
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,199
just described in order to achieve

665
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,539
though this legislative reform there's

666
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,250
basic arithmetic that has to happen

667
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:40,309
though you need a majority of votes in

668
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,559
both of the both of the both the House

669
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,850
of Representatives and in the Senate and

670
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,250
one of the arguments that's often put

671
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,389
forward is that we for example for the

672
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:52,549
USA Freedom Act that was not an

673
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,289
overwhelming vote that we got there were

674
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,610
a number of votes for example in the

675
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:57,919
House of Representatives that voted

676
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,100
against that bill but I know that there

677
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,120
was perhaps run you can talk about this

678
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,799
information about why some of those

679
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,639
representatives voted against the bill

680
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:13,490
that makes the argument for needing

681
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:16,279
better legislation put forward so the

682
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:21,470
USA Freedom Act it's it's stone long

683
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:23,419
panel but the way you get to 218 is what

684
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,860
we've been describing the way you get to

685
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,230
60 votes in the Senate is the way we've

686
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,629
way we've been describing you need that

687
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,309
pressure I mean there are certain issues

688
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,539
where on occasion you can throw a couple

689
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,770
people in a room and they'll show up

690
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:37,850
with a decent bill and everybody agrees

691
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:41,480
it passes it's just not this one the way

692
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:45,289
you get to 218 is you grind you call

693
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,880
every day you you work your ass off to

694
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:50,270
meet with every member of Congress I

695
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,260
have I will I have done 200 meetings in

696
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,750
the last year

697
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,300
[Music]

698
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,670
you but those aren't though that's not

699
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,770
the power that's not what wins the fight

700
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,420
what wins the fight is people calling

701
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,129
and constituents making clear that

702
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,790
they're not going to support somebody

703
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:10,430
who again and I can't say this loudly

704
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,530
enough supports warrantless surveillance

705
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,610
under Donald Trump and they sure as

706
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,770
shouldn't accept it from a Democrat

707
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:25,189
Thank You Shawn

708
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:28,810
get some fingers happen there where the

709
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,810
 are the companies on this fight

710
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,280
when it what so I am breaking for the

711
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,110
election right before the 2016 election

712
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,290
I was actually in Brussels talking to I

713
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,629
was talking to

714
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,550
EU people who are surveillance champions

715
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,200
about what it's like to negotiate with

716
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,700
the United States on surveillance

717
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,580
knowing you're being surveilled was this

718
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,430
a discussion over drinks there was lots

719
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,780
of beer drank yes but but one of the

720
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,640
things that with you know it was

721
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,139
interesting working on surveillance in

722
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,840
Brussels as compared to DC because

723
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,430
people are like why the hell are you

724
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,300
guys partnering with Google in the

725
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,840
United States

726
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:08,480
why the hell is Google paying for the

727
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,659
privacy community in the United States

728
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,550
that doesn't make any sense and it is in

729
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,160
fact the case that Google dumps a lot of

730
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,020
money into our allies I mean in fact I

731
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,880
think I've gotten some money from Google

732
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,690
via some of my activities full

733
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,060
disclosure

734
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:29,990
but what that means is that particularly

735
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:31,040
on USA Freedom Act and the banks - did

736
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,560
you know that there's financial

737
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,830
collection under you at under Section

738
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,280
215 we didn't talk about that the banks

739
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,020
were really happy to have their role in

740
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,660
the surveillance process not discussed

741
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,139
at all and so what the what the

742
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,420
companies did on both of these was say

743
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,820
here's where we want here's where we're

744
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,650
happy to go we're happy to be prison

745
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,169
we're happy you know

746
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,780
Verizon surprisingly was actually a

747
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,230
reasonably interesting partner on USA

748
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:07,290
Freedom Act which don't quote me on that

749
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:10,490
but but but these companies want to both

750
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:14,330
be key cogs in the surveillance machine

751
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:18,090
especially Facebook but also not have

752
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,010
consumers know that and so on both of

753
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,830
these fights they came up with where

754
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:25,050
they wanted to go and they got some key

755
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,120
players even in the privacy community to

756
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:31,169
say okay this looks like surveillance so

757
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,810
we'll go chase this down and it helps I

758
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:35,520
mean I'll be honest like it helps to

759
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,320
have Google and Apple behind you when

760
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,400
you're fighting surveillance but it also

761
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,710
means also means that some of the deals

762
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,710
are being made in Silicon Valley or by

763
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,200
really well-paid lobbyists who really

764
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:52,080
just want to be able to tell consumers

765
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,870
that they're not a big part of the

766
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,870
surveillance this surveillance machine I

767
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,929
[Applause]

768
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,120
one thing that's important to keep in

769
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:09,570
mind with companies is that the the

770
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,569
leverage that activists have over them

771
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,990
is not dissimilar from the leverage you

772
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:20,669
have over members of Congress and again

773
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:23,629
if they see an easier way out of their

774
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:27,620
predicament like being known as

775
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:30,030
government proxies then they'll take it

776
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:33,719
they're happy to take a USA Freedom Act

777
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,100
and call it a day you know III have some

778
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,020
respect for some of the companies to be

779
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:41,370
clear but the point of making sure that

780
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,590
they have to decide are they pro

781
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,480
surveillance or anti surveillance is

782
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,190
really critical the way that we see

783
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,710
activism going on for instance with

784
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,080
contracts with ice

785
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:56,070
that's amazing work I don't do it so

786
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,110
kudos to whoever is but that kind of

787
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,750
pressure looks very similar to the kind

788
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:03,480
of pressure we're talking about needing

789
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:06,810
on members of Congress can they build on

790
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:11,010
that a little bit yes I think that there

791
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:15,360
are a few elements that can help to

792
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:20,460
provide positive change here I think

793
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:22,800
that we can draw lessons from

794
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,430
enormous progress that we have made as a

795
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:33,809
society on social issues such as

796
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:37,339
marijuana such as LGBT rights and we

797
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:40,559
should look at and model the role of

798
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:43,589
local organizing and local initiatives

799
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,470
at the municipal and state level to rein

800
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:50,520
in the surveillance state to gain police

801
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,578
accountability to talk about how the

802
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,750
surveillance state feeds into the ice

803
00:35:52,579 --> 00:36:02,220
deportation machine and on a macro level

804
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:05,280
race by race to be looking at which of

805
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,799
these representatives are our friends of

806
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,750
surveillance on surveillance and which

807
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,450
are not and doing the job that is very

808
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:15,270
difficult for a 501 C 3 in DC to do

809
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,339
which is identifying candidates to run

810
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:21,000
against those people and scare the

811
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,529
bejesus out of them and I'm gonna jump

812
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,329
ahead and make Jeff really pissed at me

813
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,799
but um one of the other things about the

814
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,059
companies that's really key is one of

815
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,980
the most important surveillance

816
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,630
activists in the United States is a guy

817
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,170
who's not in the United States by the

818
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:37,680
name of max REMS Max is an Austrian

819
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,849
lawyer who keeps creating havoc in the

820
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:46,348
EU for agreements that Facebook and

821
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:48,630
Google and Apple make for the privacy of

822
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:51,930
EU citizens and he is relentless and

823
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,880
successful and that has given us more

824
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,069
leverage in the United States than

825
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,799
almost anything else because Facebook

826
00:36:56,069 --> 00:37:01,200
and Google and Microsoft need to look

827
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:05,480
like they are not surveilling EU

828
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,740
citizens where privacy actually is a big

829
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,319
political issue

830
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,180
and so that's actually more a better

831
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,829
source of leverage right now than

832
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:18,660
anything in the United States which is

833
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:21,380
how pathetic we are so I want to

834
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,569
highlight something that Alex just said

835
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,670
that there is a

836
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,580
it's been a hard few years on the

837
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,910
surveillance fight to be clear as I'm

838
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,180
sure you know but what Alex just

839
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:37,430
described including finding people or

840
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:41,950
running yourself to just challenge

841
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:44,330
people there is an empowering note here

842
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,370
DC has to do a better job of giving you

843
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,680
something to fight for but at the end of

844
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,410
the day I wanted to spell a myth that I

845
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,819
sometimes that I frequently hear that it

846
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,190
doesn't matter to call a member of

847
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,780
Congress we should probably be doing

848
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,070
workshops to be honest about how to

849
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,160
effectively engage Congress but I

850
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:04,250
promise you it does matter I know I mean

851
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,370
again ask Miguel Santiago

852
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,780
though the calls the meetings showing up

853
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,650
getting politically active the key is

854
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,770
escalation

855
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,860
the key is you ask nicely and then when

856
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:20,060
they say no you ask again and then when

857
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:23,290
they say no you run against them you put

858
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,549
up a billboard you start finding votes

859
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,410
and if you can escalate that way you

860
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,030
will get their attention and you can

861
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,270
shift the debate that way and if we

862
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,070
can't win tomorrow or we didn't win last

863
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,040
year the key is to be building

864
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,510
Momentum's that we win next time I'm

865
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
going to skip the remaining few

866
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,050
questions that I've got to get to the

867
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,310
end because I'm hoping to squeeze in a

868
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,120
few questions from folks and we're

869
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:49,460
running out of time here this might be a

870
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,990
deep level of cynicism and me talking

871
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,190
but I think we face the very real

872
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:57,080
possibility that with the expiration of

873
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,360
section 215 of the Patriot Act coming up

874
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,730
we might find ourselves in the situation

875
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,730
where there's pre compromised with in

876
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,430
Washington DC and where the reform bill

877
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,140
that the privacy community that has been

878
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,680
taking the lead on this rallies around

879
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,420
is other and we need to be put into

880
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,060
a position where we can give you the

881
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,430
folks in in who are watching this and

882
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,860
everybody in your community something as

883
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:23,330
Sean said that we can rally around that

884
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,070
we can get excited about that we can

885
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,170
invest our time and energy and pay

886
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,270
attention to so I want to ask each of

887
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,120
these panelists starting with Sean at

888
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,820
the end and moving

889
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,759
what's achievable in the next two years

890
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:39,060
what can we fix within the privacy

891
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,680
community in order to be able to be in

892
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,990
the position where we can have bills

893
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,299
that are really worth fighting for and

894
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:49,229
have the infrastructure in place to be

895
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,120
able to win those fights there are a lot

896
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,870
of different fronts that would answer

897
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,609
this question I'm gonna flag a colleague

898
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,960
of mine my boss actually Daniel Schumann

899
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,140
is also at demand progress who does

900
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,270
amazing work on oversight on changing

901
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,799
the mechanics on changing who sits on

902
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,530
these committees who's running the

903
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,000
committee that we so dearly need why

904
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,190
isn't representative Amash who's

905
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,740
actually great on surveillance why isn't

906
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,990
he on House Judiciary Committee things

907
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,540
like that are critical for the long term

908
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,729
fight we can make those changes in the

909
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,560
short term there are ways to change the

910
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:25,650
rules of the house that make a big

911
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:31,529
difference for instance but in terms of

912
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:33,030
an activist a man it's which 2018 I'm

913
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,690
pretty sure it's the end of the world if

914
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:39,800
things don't change so I think you all

915
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,540
know the answer to it it's just not easy

916
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,600
we need to go we need to get out me to

917
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,170
vote we need to make it an issue in

918
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,910
terms of 215 specifically honestly make

919
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,820
sure the organizations that that you

920
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,950
support or like or work for our vocal

921
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,750
are as engaged as they can be having

922
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,609
companies call members of Congress is a

923
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,890
huge deal it makes a big difference and

924
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:06,180
if it's an organization that either you

925
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,400
work for or you support it's it's hard

926
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,140
to get to this level of detail Marci

927
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,730
does a very good job so reading empty

928
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,839
wheel net is is a pretty good option but

929
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,710
make sure that they're supporting the

930
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,090
right things make sure they're

931
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,780
supporting reforms that you believe in

932
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:24,660
make sure that they're not gonna frankly

933
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:29,750
sell you out I do not walk into meetings

934
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:33,480
expecting compromise Thank You Sean I

935
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:39,690
should say that one of the most

936
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:42,440
important things is to not

937
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:47,290
get lost excessively

938
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:52,790
in the partisan patterns of politics

939
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:55,270
because we have a situation where we

940
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,859
have a a president who I personally

941
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:02,210
despise who is doing some terrible

942
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:04,250
things but where there are significant

943
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:07,099
allies for surveillance who are

944
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:10,089
Republicans there are significant

945
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:13,970
enemies of surveillance reform who are

946
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:18,470
Democrats and it is important for us to

947
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:21,859
grasp that sometimes on this particular

948
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:24,740
issue the party label is not the most

949
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:27,619
important thing and the we need to work

950
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:32,290
with our friends on this issue wherever

951
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:36,170
we can find them its restore the fourth

952
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:39,440
for which I'm the chair is a non

953
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:42,859
partisan movement and we welcome people

954
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,470
of all peaceful political persuasions we

955
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,240
and we have anarchists and libertarians

956
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,759
and progressives and all sorts of people

957
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:56,359
we have people who voted for Trump we

958
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:59,119
have a track record in knowing that it

959
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:02,089
works to put together campaigns and to

960
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,770
have people work together across party

961
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:10,730
lines and we need that a little bit now

962
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:13,710
[Applause]

963
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,940
one thing that I think we have done

964
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:22,249
better in recent years is beginning to

965
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:27,299
reframe who surveillance is about so

966
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:31,078
every time we have these bills people

967
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:34,019
come out and say this is about al Qaeda

968
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,019
this is about Osama bin Laden and in

969
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:39,240
fact these surveillance programs that

970
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:42,089
we're talking about probably target

971
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,839
Chinese Americans more than they target

972
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:48,749
Muslims which is surprising but it's a

973
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,849
spying bill and there have been a number

974
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:52,288
of there have been some really

975
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,809
high-profile cases

976
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:57,240
one's a professor from Temple professor

977
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:00,720
Shi from temple where Chinese Americans

978
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:03,990
engaging in perfectly legal perfectly

979
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,069
safe discussions about technology have

980
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,990
been prosecuted downstream from these

981
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:11,759
surveillance programs and so one thing

982
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,288
that we've started doing is saying this

983
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:14,880
is about Chinese Americans actually

984
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:18,720
talking to Chinese people and that's

985
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,680
legal and it should not be surveilled it

986
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,200
is a very brown portfolio of people who

987
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,259
are spied on it's it's not just Muslims

988
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,149
it's not just a thieves and Arabs it's

989
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:32,339
not Chinese Americans it's like do you

990
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:35,309
knows as Sean said increasingly used

991
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,920
against narcotics it's it's but the more

992
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:40,710
that we put faces to the impact of this

993
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,630
surveillance the more we have stories to

994
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,239
tell that are going to get people out

995
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,440
too I mean Nancy Pelosi is 20% of Nancy

996
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,359
Pelosi's constituents are

997
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,849
chinese-american and they are targeted

998
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:53,279
under 702 more than probably anybody

999
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:55,079
else and that's the kind of story we I

1000
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:57,210
think have increasingly been telling and

1001
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,059
the more we can tell those stories the

1002
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,680
more successful we're going to be thank

1003
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:05,519
you all so much I think we have time for

1004
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,440
maybe one or two questions I just want

1005
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,808
to reiterate for folks questions are

1006
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,910
under 30 seconds long and end in a

1007
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:14,069
question mark often indicated by a rise

1008
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:17,038
and inflection and our request for

1009
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:18,390
information I also know that at least

1010
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,840
one of our panelists

1011
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:24,569
some release some very dramatic and

1012
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,400
life-changing news recently but

1013
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,200
congratulations Alex for your new child

1014
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,650
please only ask questions about

1015
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:36,509
surveillance reform though so first I'd

1016
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:39,900
like to say thank you for doing the talk

1017
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,670
and the work that you do so I find a

1018
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,290
problem that I have often is that I

1019
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,610
talked to a lot of my friends and they

1020
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,550
look like look at me like I have a

1021
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,170
tinfoil hat on when I try to explain

1022
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,150
like the threats involved with a lot of

1023
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:55,920
the stuff what recommendations do you

1024
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:59,670
have for conveying like the real risks

1025
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,760
that we face to common people who are

1026
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:05,400
non techies and you know maybe not as

1027
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,980
interested as they should be I think one

1028
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,680
way to convey it to them is a lot of the

1029
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,140
descriptions of what Facebook collects

1030
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,120
on you I mean here's the rule right if

1031
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,569
Facebook collects it the government is

1032
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,160
going to get it and so a lot of the

1033
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,780
discussion of say Cambridge in analytic

1034
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,569
oh or the psychographics or what have

1035
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,930
you all of that stuff that Facebook or

1036
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,910
Google or whoever is doing that's

1037
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,950
precisely the kind of the spying that

1038
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,359
the government is doing but the

1039
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,560
government can put you in prison

1040
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,240
they're not trying to sell you

1041
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,759
toothpaste they're trying to put you in

1042
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,919
prison and so I think if you use those

1043
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,560
descriptions of surveillance and frankly

1044
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,240
the the the really ominous cases if you

1045
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,400
look at some of this stuff China's doing

1046
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,370
on the same kinds of surveillance

1047
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,450
particularly targeting certain

1048
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,720
communities in China

1049
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:58,259
that's the technologies all they're here

1050
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,770
and we now have a leader who is an

1051
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,680
authoritarian at least intent and so I

1052
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:06,750
think if you say you take Facebook you

1053
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,359
take the kinds of applications the China

1054
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,190
is doing on spying like all day on

1055
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,590
people who are viewed as dissidents and

1056
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,360
that's where we could be in the very

1057
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:18,180
very new future with with the

1058
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,070
surveillance infrastructure in place we

1059
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,609
have another question

1060
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:25,080
so to Sean's point about you know the

1061
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,470
comparison of SOPA and the net

1062
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:32,770
neutrality battle my thought is that

1063
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:34,720
in that case it's about stuff people if

1064
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,820
you threaten to take away people's stuff

1065
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,490
they go crazy

1066
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,260
and you know they perceive that you know

1067
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,990
if they're gonna imagine they're gonna

1068
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,850
lose their Netflix or they're not going

1069
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,020
to be able to have read it as we know it

1070
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:53,650
then people were react to Jeff's point

1071
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,750
about the companies I feel nothing gets

1072
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:59,860
done in this country unless it cuts into

1073
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:03,940
somebody's ledger somehow and manin x'

1074
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:07,120
that we partner with google or we find

1075
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:10,570
more honorable partners like let's say

1076
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,400
co who is isn't a business of privacy as

1077
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,880
and put it in an ornament amount of

1078
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:19,030
money into privacy activism already my

1079
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,550
question for you is how do we get people

1080
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:25,420
pissed off to the point that you said

1081
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:27,280
that you know if if politicians actually

1082
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:33,340
start to feel threatened how do we get

1083
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:35,710
people feeling like that one I think

1084
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:40,200
we're out of time but Alex do you want

1085
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:43,390
to go first by chance I think that

1086
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:46,990
people really I don't think people are

1087
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,549
simply motivated by what is on that edge

1088
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,970
or what's in their pocketbook though

1089
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:54,220
that does matter very much I think

1090
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:57,640
people do not want to see their

1091
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:01,060
communities torn apart and we see that

1092
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:04,450
around ice activism right now they do

1093
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:10,120
not want to see kids suffer they do not

1094
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:12,310
want to see one ethnicity or one set of

1095
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,069
people in life set against another and

1096
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,990
treating each other like enemies and I

1097
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:20,050
think that there is great scope in

1098
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:25,060
focusing on the inherently dehumanizing

1099
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:30,130
nature of surveillance and the ways in

1100
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:33,090
which it is creating a nation of petty

1101
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:36,370
informants with us even unintentionally

1102
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:39,580
conveying data about each other to the

1103
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:42,290
more of the surveillance state this is

1104
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,690
not a future that people want

1105
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:47,210
we talked to people and this is not a

1106
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,490
future that anybody wants it's a matter

1107
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,710
of personalizing it down to people's

1108
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:55,299
communities and making it matter in that

1109
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:57,940
sense to the people they see every day

1110
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:00,260
thank you I believe we are out of time

1111
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,670
there's another panel coming up after us

1112
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,410
so a big THANK YOU and a round of

1113
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,690
applause for our panelists here thank

1114
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:12,908
you all so much for coming

1115
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:12,909
[Applause]

1116
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,910
you
