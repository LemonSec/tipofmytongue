1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
tried to get more radio content this

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,650
year at hope because there's a lot of

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,720
crossover between folks that like to

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,220
hack radio and hack computers and hack

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:15,540
other phones and other things like that

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:17,150
so I'm I'm part of that scene and I met

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,000
to petri dish

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,880
what like 20 years ago or more than 20

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,948
years ago back in Philadelphia radio

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,750
mutiny had this radius this pirate

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,119
station on the air I heard I'm like this

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,969
is interesting I gotta get involved so

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,710
we we work together on this and you know

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,219
they'll he'll tell you the whole long

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:44,129
story of how radio mutiny played a key

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:46,079
part in a community radio movement that

17
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,410
led to where we are today where a hacker

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,129
space was able to start a legal FM

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,099
broadcast station so we have st. and

20
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,089
petri dish and this is gonna be a really

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,489
interesting talk thanks for coming ah

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,379
thanks so much thanks so much Bernie so

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,289
I'm gonna just start with a little bit

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,729
of background on FM just so that we can

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,140
you know just catch up make sure

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,560
everyone in the rooms in the same place

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,280
about the history of it all so the FM

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,170
band was allocated in the late 40s you

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,100
know the first radio was am broadcasting

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,200
in the in the in the mid 1920s and and

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,110
FM came along there were three big

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,009
differences with FM one was that it it

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,220
had better sound it just sounded a whole

34
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,409
lot better another was that it it really

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,908
was much less susceptible to

36
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,409
interference than a.m. was another big

37
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,149
difference was that it had only a line

38
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,250
of sight range so there's no such thing

39
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,850
as an FM station that really goes more

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,920
than 40 50 60 miles basically out to the

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,869
horizon occasionally they'll be like

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,420
weird atmospherics but but basically

43
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,520
it's a it's a local medium and the third

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,770
thing was that there was a band set

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,048
aside called the non-commercial band

46
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,720
between 88 and 92 because most of radio

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,250
had become so commercialized that people

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,459
felt the need for there to be like a

49
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,830
public park

50
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,720
on the FM band like a place where it

51
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,640
wasn't just about making the most profit

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,609
and that was where a lot of colleges a

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,738
lot of nonprofit organizations sort of

54
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,819
stepped in and started making making

55
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,470
radio o at first they didn't really know

56
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,268
what to do with FM and in fact some

57
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,700
stations have to give away FM radios in

58
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,379
order to get people to listen to it and

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,000
a lot of a.m. stations would just

60
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:43,690
simulcast over over FM but by the 70s

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,220
80s it became a very powerful and and

62
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,950
predominant medium and so and it started

63
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,079
running out of space and so it became

64
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,089
more there became more and more conflict

65
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,829
when it came to trying to get a radio

66
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,230
station in fact in the non-commercial

67
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,500
part of the band the conflict became so

68
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,078
bitter and and legalistic that they

69
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,799
start that all the processes were broken

70
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:12,250
and it became impossible to get an FM

71
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,409
non-commercial license around late 1980s

72
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,889
or so and in fact there was no way to

73
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:24,910
get one between about 1987 1988 and 2007

74
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:27,579
so in the context of this and of course

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,739
in the beginning in that time nobody

76
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,090
wanted to have small radio stations you

77
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,980
know most people that want to get into

78
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,599
radio want to build a giant empire and

79
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,690
have like the entire world listening to

80
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,198
them but there there came to be a group

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,910
of people that started thinking you know

82
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,290
just like you don't have like a single

83
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,668
national government there's like more

84
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,230
than just the president there's like the

85
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,049
state level there's the local level

86
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,310
there's city government there's PTAs

87
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,260
wouldn't it make some sense to have like

88
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,780
radio that is devoted to these like

89
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,739
local things because your your citywide

90
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,410
New York NPR affiliate cannot cover like

91
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,989
your local PTA board election or who's

92
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,549
running for dog catcher but but a like a

93
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,989
smaller neighborhood radio station

94
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,489
really could do that and there were a

95
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,500
lot of spaces on the dial that we're

96
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,269
left that we're really being not used

97
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,699
because no one thought of them as

98
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,269
profitable enough and so into this gap

99
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:23,190
stepped a pirate radio movement in the

100
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,220
early 90s I won't go too far into that

101
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:30,440
except to say that

102
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:33,680
there was a kind of a an amazingly crazy

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,680
and audacious anti-war activist named

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
Steven Donna fir who was an electrical

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,760
engineer and he he built himself a

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,890
pirate radio station and a backpack and

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,280
was was broadcasting without a license

108
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,719
and when he got caught the National

109
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,510
Lawyers Guild command Democratic

110
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,380
communications made a pretty amazing

111
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,280
argument that yes the FCC can limit the

112
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,650
First Amendment rights of of who has

113
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,270
radio broadcast licenses but it has to

114
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,229
do it in the way that's the least

115
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,539
harmful to the First Amendment and so

116
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,070
the judge in the case was like whoa I

117
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,270
hadn't really thought about it

118
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,310
yeah mister Donna fer can keep on

119
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,969
broadcasting so there was this really

120
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,919
crazy time between about 93 and 98 where

121
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,570
like the FCC was pretty much unable to

122
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,729
enforce its rules against pirate radio

123
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,530
and into that gap stepped about a

124
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,000
thousand pirate radio stations that

125
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,090
started operating around the country

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,470
because we all knew that if anyone was

127
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,820
going to go to jail would be Stephen

128
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,590
first and and that that made us all

129
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,200
bolder than we would have ordinarily

130
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:47,690
been so that case was also in the case

131
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,300
in in the context of a major shift in

132
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,990
how the media was owned and operated and

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,490
controlled

134
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,060
there was the Telecommunications Act of

135
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,880
1996 which got rid of almost all the

136
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,790
limitations on ownership of radio

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,800
stations and so you ended up you know

138
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,510
back in back in the old days you know no

139
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,660
one could own more than 20 radio

140
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,700
stations and really to like to most

141
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,160
people that sounds like plenty but to

142
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,870
Clear Channel that sounded like a

143
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,370
drastic limitation on their freedom of

144
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,260
speech they didn't have the freedom to

145
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:23,660
repeat themselves on a thousand channels

146
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:25,340
across the country so what they what the

147
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,560
telecom act did was it got rid of all

148
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,169
those a lot of those limitations and you

149
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,380
saw local diversity in media go down

150
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,060
local ownership go down dramatically

151
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,460
minority ownership go from the whopping

152
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,660
3% that it was down to about one and a

153
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,190
half percent

154
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,550
the course of just a couple years and

155
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,130
that really sort of turned some heads at

156
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,220
the FCC and they started looking at the

157
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,590
Pirates not only as as a pretty severe

158
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,210
legal problem for them but also in some

159
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,700
ways as part of the solution and they

160
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,620
started saying gosh well maybe we

161
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,180
actually should license some of these

162
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,100
small frequencies that we otherwise

163
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,480
thought were kind of garbage frequencies

164
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,250
that no one else would want in the first

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,260
place and so around that time was when

166
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:14,960
my station was busted the station that

167
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:17,659
that that Bernie and I worked on and at

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,180
that point a group of us started a group

169
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,010
called prometheus wave project which we

170
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,360
were kind of dealt a weird hand you know

171
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,550
a lot of us probably would have

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,840
preferred to stay pirates forever but on

173
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,760
the other hand we started realizing that

174
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,320
actually almost no matter what we did

175
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,230
there would be there would be a

176
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,550
legalization and these frequencies that

177
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,160
we were using we're going to be given

178
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,710
out and so if we did not prepare social

179
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,480
justice movements workers movements

180
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,890
immigrants rights groups the kinds of

181
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,050
groups that we wanted to see on the air

182
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,900
all these stations would get scooped up

183
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,860
by religious fundamentalists and and

184
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,560
translators so that was the moment where

185
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,310
my own personal life got a lot more

186
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,040
boring they went from you know pirate

187
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,110
radio and swords and parrots and eye

188
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,710
patches to teaching people how to fill

189
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,480
out a lot of forms and and put you know

190
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,760
put these stations on the air illegally

191
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,900
so we spent a couple years in Washington

192
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,050
trying to sort out how the rules were

193
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,060
gonna work and in 2000 they passed a new

194
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,040
set of rules called the low-power FM

195
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,500
rules and initially they were going to

196
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,410
give out a lot of frequencies around the

197
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,200
country but the broadcasting industry

198
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,940
got so furious that they were beaten by

199
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,400
you know radio pirates and anarchists

200
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,740
and and whoever that they went to

201
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,740
Congress and they said Congress the FCC

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,419
has they're smoking crack they have made

203
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,250
a terrible terrible mistake and they

204
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,280
gave out all these licenses to all these

205
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,030
flake azides you know like what on earth

206
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,649
were they thinking so within about six

207
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,610
months of us winning and the

208
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,209
see see starting to give out these

209
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,389
licenses Congress passed a bill as part

210
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:02,420
of an appropriations rider a sneaky like

211
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,490
sort of eleventh-hour thing where they

212
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,290
took away all of the radio stations that

213
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,699
would be given out in urban areas in the

214
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,069
United States and so there were all

215
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,809
those low power FM went forward there

216
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:15,290
were no channels that were allowed in

217
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:17,389
the top fifty Oban markets and there was

218
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,969
you know most small towns that might

219
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,949
have had six seven channels available

220
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,319
they had maybe one and so it would

221
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:27,349
become a fight between the civil rights

222
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:28,878
group and Evangelic old church even

223
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,050
though that there there were like plenty

224
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,679
of frequencies that were perfectly

225
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,079
usable so I what I didn't know at the

226
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,899
time which I later learned on average it

227
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,309
takes industry trade group about six to

228
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,439
nine months to get something that it

229
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:43,910
really wants from Congress and on

230
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,800
average it takes a citizen's

231
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,209
organization working with grassroots

232
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,740
mobilization and you know direct you

233
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,209
know constituent meetings and all that

234
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,220
sort of thing it takes about ten years

235
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:58,939
to pass so one thing if you're ever

236
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,670
thinking about you know regulations and

237
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:03,349
technology and legislation is that's

238
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,709
kind of how it works that's how they win

239
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,179
is whatever your demand is make sure

240
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,609
it's going to still be worthwhile ten

241
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:15,199
years later and it's still going to make

242
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,639
a difference so so what we ended up

243
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,170
doing was we spent the next ten years

244
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,480
building a whole lot of radio stations

245
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,449
in very small towns not in New Orleans

246
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,040
but in Opelousas Louisiana not in

247
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:27,439
Portland Oregon but in Woodburn Oregon

248
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,748
and working with a lot of small groups

249
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:34,040
and and building enough of a movement

250
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:36,529
and a like enough of a group to pass the

251
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,079
legislation to allow low-power FM into

252
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:44,689
into larger urban areas we did that in

253
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:47,029
2011 and it took the FCC about two years

254
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:48,980
to really go through the law and take

255
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,100
notice and comment and implement the new

256
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,199
regulations and so in 2013 there was a

257
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,649
filing window for more of a power FM

258
00:10:54,199 --> 00:11:00,620
stations and this time it did include

259
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,449
the cities now the FM band is is limited

260
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,259
there was never any question about that

261
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,779
there's never room from

262
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,970
more than 40 50 depending how big the

263
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,970
metropolitan area is there's never

264
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,319
really more room for more than 40 50 60

265
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,540
radio stations without causing

266
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:18,599
interference to each other and in some

267
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,299
places that's plenty

268
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,209
but in some places like like New York or

269
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,978
or Miami or Los Angeles or some of those

270
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,929
places there they're never going to be

271
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,639
as many FM channels as there are people

272
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,279
that you know that could do a good job

273
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:37,009
of doing something with them

274
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:39,299
so what we managed to win was a set of

275
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,979
technical rules where there were about

276
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,929
two to four channels in most major

277
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:45,479
cities New York was the exception there

278
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:48,228
only I think one or two channels that

279
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:53,999
were made available in New York City and

280
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:57,359
Los Angeles there were 35 applicants no

281
00:11:53,999 --> 00:12:01,350
32 applicants for just one channel in

282
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:04,439
Los Angeles and so it was a giant giant

283
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,029
mess a giant competition between all

284
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:07,799
these different groups that wanted to be

285
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,509
on the air a couple of them managed to

286
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,699
find a second channel in a different

287
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,859
part of the city but still there were

288
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,358
all these groups that really should have

289
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,220
been collaborating and should have been

290
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:20,669
partners but instead at this point are

291
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,470
all you know well a coalition emerged up

292
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,970
a bunch of them that that all decided

293
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,379
that they were only going to be nice to

294
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,569
each other and share the airwaves but

295
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,189
they were also a bunch of others that

296
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,339
were like more like bad actors that just

297
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:35,819
tried to like tattle on the FCC to each

298
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:42,209
other and and and and try to try to take

299
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:44,429
each other down um so at this point with

300
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:48,029
the current FCC there's almost no

301
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:51,149
interest in low-power FM the Cremona

302
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:54,269
current FCC Chairman G PI who most of

303
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:58,109
you have heard is trying to take away

304
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,669
net neutrality he has really never

305
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:02,999
really talked about this no no real

306
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:04,499
interest he and the only thing he does

307
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:07,799
want to do is he wants to give a bunch

308
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:10,159
of channels away to AM stations that

309
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:17,189
that are trying to get onto the FM band

310
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:20,709
so at this point there's no LPFM

311
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:24,160
window in the works probably won't be

312
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:27,099
for who knows three years five years

313
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,360
eight years ten years and also the fact

314
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,670
of the matter is if you're in any urban

315
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,120
area the best channels have already been

316
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,250
given away so there they're not a lot

317
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,209
more opportunities what there are though

318
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:43,540
is there's about 2,200 low-power films

319
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:46,869
on the air around the United States just

320
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:50,589
about every state has at least 50 60 70

321
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,529
100 of them and you know of the FM's

322
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:55,870
that exist probably about 40% or

323
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,339
religious that you know they are

324
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,709
involved with like these satellite

325
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:02,440
networks that are sort of like this like

326
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,089
you know give me your money or you're

327
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,510
going to burn in hell sort of

328
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,970
programming but a lot of the rest of

329
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:13,330
them are amazing organizations groups

330
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:17,170
that I'm really thrilled to work with

331
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,730
and a lot of groups for recent

332
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,880
immigrants a fair number of colleges

333
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,770
have them a lot of social justice

334
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,740
organizations environmental groups and

335
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:30,819
so that's the kinds of groups that that

336
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,470
we do our work with so I'll just say you

337
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,630
know if you're interested in getting

338
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,540
involved with low-power FM the moment

339
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,000
has passed to start your own but if you

340
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,819
want to participate in one there's a

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,490
zillion and there's a zillion that would

342
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,220
probably love to have you involved have

343
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,589
you you know create programming have you

344
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,230
you know create technical solutions for

345
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,660
all kinds of the like really interesting

346
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,540
technical problems that that radio

347
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,399
stations have in order to make them work

348
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,620
better make them go farther you know

349
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,529
bring them onto into podcasting and into

350
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:09,220
the internet so there's a there's a lot

351
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:11,350
to do so um that won't all right yeah

352
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,930
that sounds good and I'd love to help

353
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,480
out and take whatever content you have

354
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,180
and put it on the air and of course the

355
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,750
Internet when I first when I first got

356
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,520
the opportunity from Todd Urich to

357
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,950
create an LP FM for the hacker space I'm

358
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:32,079
like oh sweet does anyone

359
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:34,660
- FM anymore like is that a thing of all

360
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:41,020
my friends we all stream our music we

361
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:44,860
don't use that much FM radio I mean okay

362
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,350
all I'll do that kind of as a lark and

363
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,950
then I got into it you know wow these

364
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:56,430
people are very serious about what might

365
00:15:50,950 --> 00:16:03,220
be a dead whale carcass of FM radio I'm

366
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:06,189
serious about it okay so yeah yeah I

367
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,000
might take a really long time for you to

368
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,030
get an opportunity to get into making

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,670
your own LPFM for your hack space or for

370
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:23,860
your community but instead of going into

371
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:26,560
things entirely blind as I did I I wish

372
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,070
I had actually gone around to some of my

373
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,229
existing LP FM's like the college and

374
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:35,920
just volunteered as a DJ just learned

375
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:42,880
how their tech stack works just didn't

376
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:47,819
jump in entirely naive to feet-first you

377
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:53,230
know I'm about as naive as Petry is

378
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:56,080
experienced it's not good Prometheus is

379
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,260
a great place to start you can talk to

380
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,290
us

381
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:04,329
I've been there I can tell you what I've

382
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:06,909
done and not to do that at least not to

383
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,560
do some of it and he can you can give

384
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,510
you a much more in-depth thing common

385
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,639
frequency is a great place to get an LP

386
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,940
FM I don't know that they've done much

387
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,730
since 2013 they're very active oh they

388
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,610
are okay alright I'm completely mistaken

389
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,000
but they they will help you get an LP FM

390
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,619
when that window opens again you can see

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,660
your local LP M's

392
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:39,459
LP FM's at this link and Petrie's site

393
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,390
is I am a radio HTTP I am a radio so you

394
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,730
can check that out

395
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:47,770
all right so this is what we did you

396
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:55,620
have time for this okay yes awesome I do

397
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:55,620
let's let's blunder forth so I know

398
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,629
let's just go to this one I actually

399
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,880
used to have this up in a tab and then I

400
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,760
let my thing die

401
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:16,890
so um cuz I'm smart like that so heck if

402
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:21,160
I can do it you can I mean yeah for sure

403
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,929
right okay so here's kind of the project

404
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,299
log of how we went through and I'm just

405
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,960
gonna spend maybe not even five minutes

406
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:32,918
on this but this is the trials and

407
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:37,900
tribulations of starting up an FM radio

408
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:41,830
station relatively uninformed okay

409
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,650
entirely uninformed so my moniker is st.

410
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,840
but on I used to be nearly militant

411
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,030
atheist now I'm just I'm not

412
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,070
particularly religious one way or the

413
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:56,139
other so no worries

414
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,600
III don't have a problem with religion

415
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,390
really as long as it's always I'm

416
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,889
getting off track so okay we got a 107.9

417
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:10,360
approved by the FCC in October 1st of

418
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:12,940
2013 it took us until February of this

419
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,928
year to get it up and we did that

420
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,290
through extensions

421
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:19,440
it was difficult we were gonna put it on

422
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:29,940
the US bank we weren't allowed to oh

423
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:29,940
bugger let's see yeah we'll do it live

424
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:43,840
let me just jump back here and represent

425
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,340
what is going on with you you confused

426
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,020
little you want me take it for a minute

427
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,760
while you get that please no no no no

428
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,350
you keep the computer all right so I'm

429
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,179
hopeless with that alright I just talked

430
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,949
for a minute while you

431
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:59,729
do that I think you know one real

432
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:03,989
interesting thing is you know in terms

433
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:07,289
of the dying whale carcass about them I

434
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:10,379
am completely blown away that people are

435
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,450
still listening to help to FM at this

436
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,070
time you know we were just taking a look

437
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,129
at some of the statistics around it and

438
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,539
while the people that I know are

439
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:21,658
overwhelmingly not listening to FM at

440
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:25,019
this point you know my housemates are a

441
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:27,229
lot of people that that I work with you

442
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:31,070
know the latest numbers that we found

443
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:34,109
93% of Americans listen to FM every week

444
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:39,389
and in terms of the time spent with

445
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:41,549
audio 54% of Americans know 54 percent

446
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:44,820
of the time that people spend with audio

447
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:47,249
is with AM and FM radio as opposed to

448
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,589
about 16 percent of people's time they

449
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:52,320
spend with their own tapes and records

450
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:54,960
and CDs and mp3s and that sort of thing

451
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,799
right about 15 percent listen to

452
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,289
streaming some form of live streaming

453
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,599
either on YouTube or on Pandora and

454
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:06,408
about two percent of time spent

455
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:10,200
listening is spent with with podcasts so

456
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:12,059
why on earth are still are people still

457
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,940
listening to FM when there are all these

458
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,219
you know technical possibilities that

459
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,529
are you know in lots of ways way

460
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:21,599
superior to FM in terms of like some of

461
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,489
their capabilities and I'll leave the

462
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,859
answer to that until cuz you got jurors

463
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:27,419
working all right

464
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:31,349
yeah so that I was just gonna go through

465
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:34,320
the Hackett heck heck of a i io logs and

466
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:36,889
show you I figured that'd be the easiest

467
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,379
and quickest that was a mistake

468
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:45,539
so essentially all someone up in 30

469
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:51,089
seconds we moved four times were evicted

470
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:53,669
once it was it was exciting we had to

471
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:56,070
get is actually relatively easy to get

472
00:21:53,669 --> 00:22:00,139
the federal paperwork done but the city

473
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:03,139
paperwork was extraordinarily difficult

474
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:03,139
we

475
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:11,860
I had fun and we eventually ended up

476
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:13,990
using our friends to take care of the

477
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,149
hackerspace when we got kicked out for a

478
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,420
full year until we could buy our own

479
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,280
place and then we rented a tower instead

480
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,309
of put the tower on our building because

481
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,129
we're downtown but that also means down

482
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:32,860
in that gully in town and that's not a

483
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:35,500
great spot for a transmitter so we

484
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,600
bought an $8,000 transmitter there are

485
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,640
two thousand dollar transmitters on eBay

486
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,770
they're apparently illegal because they

487
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,169
don't have a magic stamp that says that

488
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:50,830
they're legitimate they're from China

489
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:53,169
and their tolerances are fantastic but

490
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,668
we we can't use them they need a magic

491
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,740
stamp we we got a fairly nice EAS

492
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:03,640
emergency alert system an end deck I

493
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:06,190
should say an end deck - and we sprung

494
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,540
for a decent cable but we stuck with it

495
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:15,580
and we then started into the technical

496
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,830
areas of creating the radio room now we

497
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,370
are all absolutely brilliant people and

498
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:26,830
we're always entirely on task ahead of

499
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:29,709
time and under budget yeah so we created

500
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:35,428
the super advanced radio control and

501
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,429
storage mix room also known as sarcasm

502
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:44,559
in my radio room with my like two month

503
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,970
old daughter at the time and I'm using

504
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,070
mix which is all I know it's for mixing

505
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,660
DJ you're mixing parties you know and

506
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,570
I'm playing that out over the airwaves

507
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,299
and it's it's really smooth and it's

508
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,520
really fantastic but it has limited

509
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:04,389
scheduling ability which is what you

510
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:08,530
really want oh but I'm so happy and

511
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:14,380
naive just like now this reminds me of

512
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:16,899
now there's a here's a glimpse of our

513
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,410
master schedule I just thought you might

514
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:23,050
be vaguely interested in seeing kind of

515
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:25,570
the content we put up we got permission

516
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:28,000
from stank dog to broadcast hacker

517
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:32,409
public radio which is filled with swear

518
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,790
words and awesome so after hours were

519
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:39,700
heavily edited we have no news which

520
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:42,159
it's kind of fun Tech Talk I think is

521
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,140
actually copyrighted so I can't do that

522
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,720
I can't do Tech Talk I think it's

523
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,970
copyrighted so we're probably going to

524
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,440
do tik-tok Tech Talks maybe that's more

525
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,690
different maybe that's different enough

526
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,730
and they'll just be faster versions of

527
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,150
Tech Talks there's just more information

528
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:01,270
dense we play a lot of EDM in classical

529
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:06,280
because that's just you know obviously

530
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:08,918
goes hand in hand we found our lawyer

531
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,730
who supposedly had the complaint to kick

532
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:16,720
us out he didn't he has been creating

533
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:23,890
laws online so he's been translating the

534
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:29,500
laws it takes into account with the new

535
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:31,630
age of computers now how the law ties

536
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,280
into computers all right so how do you

537
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,620
connect all these things you have a ten

538
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,690
you have your antenna and cable and ES

539
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,280
and transmitter and they all seem to

540
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:45,280
plug together at weight no they don't

541
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:47,200
it's this isn't Legos oh so I'm I'm of

542
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,240
the generation when building a computer

543
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,179
meant essentially you can put Legos

544
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,710
together good job and you can read like

545
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:58,450
basic bus speeds good job here's here's

546
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:07,840
how we did it so we had our antenna up

547
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:11,559
on top of roan 25g guide tower and it

548
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,320
just had some fancy helix helix helix

549
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,649
iliacs cable heliox equivalent cable

550
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,270
that went to our transmitter I've never

551
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,110
seen the cable before in my life it's

552
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:25,490
it's like half

553
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:34,939
an inch thick and it's just has

554
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:39,990
fantastic sigh moving on to the index

555
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,380
the index is going to give out those

556
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,270
[Music]

557
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,770
messages you get on the FM radio telling

558
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:50,299
you that you're about to be crushed by a

559
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:52,490
tornado or something right so it gives

560
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:55,660
you those emergency broadcast systems it

561
00:26:52,490 --> 00:27:01,640
hooks to the internet and it hooks to

562
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:03,140
our laptop our server which is just a

563
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,760
laptop that we set on top of the

564
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:10,370
transmitter because it's I mean you

565
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:17,200
don't need much we ended up using ice

566
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:21,320
cast that took a long drawn-out panicked

567
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,790
month to figure out because we didn't

568
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,840
start with it we started using Google

569
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:29,000
Hangouts and a virtual audio cable which

570
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,000
essentially it's like if you plugged in

571
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,580
your microphone in or your speaker into

572
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,260
your line in you know with a audio jack

573
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,620
only it does it virtually so you don't

574
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,390
have to waste physical ports so then

575
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,040
anything we played out ended up being

576
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,280
recorded and sent through Google

577
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,570
Hangouts to our server problem with that

578
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,790
Google Hangouts isn't meant to run 24/7

579
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:56,450
so just just in case you you're

580
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:59,899
wondering we tried the same thing with

581
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,820
Skype it would work out but it drop out

582
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,910
periodically in the middle of the night

583
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:10,159
and we'd have dead air so we eventually

584
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:14,630
switched to but which is the client to

585
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,850
send to ice cast and the advantage about

586
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,770
ice cast is it's really easy to create a

587
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,129
rate internet radio station with ice

588
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:24,110
cast so the fact that we haven't done it

589
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,570
is only due to our brilliance and our

590
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,899
ability to stay on time and

591
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:32,840
budget so and then we switched a radio

592
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:36,709
DJ instead of mix mix is really awesome

593
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,799
but it it can't schedule very well to my

594
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:44,720
knowledge and of course we SSH into our

595
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:45,799
system um yeah that's yeah I'm gonna go

596
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,059
over this really quick because it

597
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,350
doesn't really matter too much this I'm

598
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,500
just going to go over some screenshots

599
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,039
of how I had to file you'll notice that

600
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:03,110
I had to file a couple amendments here

601
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:11,120
and this is just an example of section

602
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:12,949
one on the form 318 319 permission I'm

603
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,600
just going through these so you can look

604
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,850
at them on a YouTube later and have them

605
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,809
for reference what I'll just mention the

606
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:23,449
the guy that designed the FCC's website

607
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:26,210
I saw him talk recently and he was like

608
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:30,259
I designed an awesome website for the

609
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:34,850
FCC in 1998 and it's still the same one

610
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:37,909
yeah yeah you might look do I have the

611
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,939
URL it's like WS dot exe yeah there we

612
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,940
go

613
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:49,340
the URL just winning but you know it is

614
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,740
it is a very functional web site and

615
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,199
it's still running fine today so kudos

616
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:58,629
to him I guess I mean yeah that's that's

617
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,669
pretty impressive I haven't done that I

618
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:04,939
don't know anyone else who has either so

619
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:09,110
um the forms are kind of long on get

620
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,950
help get lots of help there's lots of

621
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,049
people to help you

622
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,580
I mean figuring out a 26-page

623
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,559
application can be kind of tricky

624
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:20,629
especially when they use jargon that

625
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:23,720
they make up on the spot and something

626
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:27,219
that is apparently it do I not have a

627
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,110
questions I thought I had a questions

628
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,289
yeah you know no here no that's it I

629
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:36,949
must have oh the laptop died right okay

630
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:39,980
well that is it for the presentation I

631
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,679
have one glorious little thing too

632
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,679
leave you with this is an example of

633
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,910
some of our content we're trying to

634
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,850
satirize bullying so this false

635
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:55,220
advertising segment brought to you by

636
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,379
satire now the use of humor irony

637
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,230
exaggeration or ridicule to expose and

638
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,760
criticize people's stupidity or vices

639
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,370
used with permission the Oxford

640
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,990
Dictionary not Waterloo are you

641
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,000
listening to this station as the only

642
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,250
sound wafting through empty hallways of

643
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,809
a forsaken high school are you still

644
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,270
trapped in your locker as your fellow

645
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:17,360
academic peers enjoy advanced biology

646
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,770
then you need walk early apply a thin

647
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,299
coat of locker loop to the inside of

648
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,650
your steel or plastic Locker every

649
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,168
Sunday night and a liberal amount to

650
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,330
your arms each school morning remember

651
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,330
being bullied is your fault

652
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:37,250
so yeah you know just you know common a

653
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:43,629
wholesome family entertainment yeah

654
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:46,520
questions is the pain of my cousin Cole

655
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,010
back on the actual piracy side of things

656
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,710
I it's so nice that all this is legal no

657
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,240
but um a couple years ago there was a

658
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,309
government shutdown because there was

659
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,900
some bickering about budgets and I

660
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:59,149
happen to be looking for some

661
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,830
information about like radio licensing

662
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,200
at that time I went to the FCC website

663
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,939
and in place of the normal FCC website

664
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,000
there was just this letter from the

665
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,770
director of the FCC to all the employees

666
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,179
basically saying don't come to work we

667
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,040
can't pay you you're not allowed to work

668
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,210
mm-hmm

669
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,340
doing those couple of days of a

670
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,380
government shutdown is it

671
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:22,000
free-for-all piracy again

672
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,420
well you know I mean it's a funny thing

673
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,410
I mean you know having having done radio

674
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,670
piracy and having done the power found

675
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:33,520
having worked with a lot of a lot of

676
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,740
radio stations I mean there there is an

677
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,170
amazing free-for-all of piracy in in a

678
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,900
couple cities right now I mean in New

679
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,810
York you know we just saw David Korins

680
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,340
great presentation yesterday you know

681
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,159
there's close to a hundred pirates

682
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,020
around New York right now that you could

683
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,450
listen to you know a lot of them from

684
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,700
immigrant communities a lot of them in

685
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,930
different languages and you know

686
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,790
truthfully our family is no solution for

687
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,020
them and what they're trying to do you

688
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,230
know there were never going to be enough

689
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:09,520
frequencies for all that to be going on

690
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:13,900
and you know what it comes down to with

691
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:16,360
piracy is is a question of like who is

692
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,520
the FCC does not have the resources to

693
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,310
go around chasing down pirates you know

694
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,050
they don't have listening-posts

695
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,330
24/7 on every frequency all across the

696
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:29,470
country so they rely on complaints and

697
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:31,240
so really with a lot of pirates if no

698
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,790
one ever complains they will never get

699
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,700
caught because that's it's just sort of

700
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:39,430
how it works you know there are there

701
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,650
are certain even if people do complain

702
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,310
you know there's the limited resources

703
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:48,550
to actually go and catch them all for me

704
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:52,480
personally the reason that I moved first

705
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,310
of all I saw the way that that was going

706
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,730
to go and that like a lot of the best

707
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,560
frequencies the most truly viable ones

708
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,290
were going to be taken up and start

709
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,629
being used by by legitimate low-power FM

710
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:08,020
radio stations and I thought that and

711
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:10,419
and I also had a lot of experience while

712
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,040
running the pirate station of people

713
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,899
that I really wanted to be on the air

714
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,100
people that I thought had like really

715
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:18,159
important things to say really

716
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,719
interesting voices you know they would

717
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,950
come they would train with our station

718
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,839
they would start like learning how to

719
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:25,540
use all the equipment and then like the

720
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,770
day before it was time for them to start

721
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,120
on the air they were they're kind of

722
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,500
like chickened out they would be like oh

723
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,569
man like I

724
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,280
you know my DS is kind of screwed up by

725
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,990
like I can't be here when they kick down

726
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
the door and start like running around

727
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,138
now that's not everyone that's certainly

728
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,360
not the hundred Brooklyn pirates that

729
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,919
are out there right now but that was my

730
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,480
experience of like dealing with a lot of

731
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,299
really pretty cool people that I I

732
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,560
really thought should have a voice and

733
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,720
that this is the sort of thing that you

734
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,090
know if we could win a reform that would

735
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,399
actually like make people able to be on

736
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:57,820
the air it was it was super worthwhile

737
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,680
to do it so you know there's always

738
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,260
these kinds of there are these moments

739
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,419
and you know that's one thing you know

740
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,860
for you know from what I was talking

741
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,990
about before that's something that

742
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,780
lawyers can do an incredible job of is

743
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,120
like sort of creating these moments when

744
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,090
it's not really clear what the law is

745
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,630
and whether the law as it stands is is

746
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,130
constitutional as is is can be enforced

747
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,650
the way it is and that's what created

748
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,800
the one pirate boom that I was really

749
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:30,100
part of so yeah there there are always

750
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,080
these kind of moments when when piracy

751
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,029
does work you know and when it's the

752
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:40,120
best option it's the best it's the best

753
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:41,820
thing to do very cool so so speaking of

754
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,990
things that may have just become legal

755
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:49,060
or maybe not so helical HD radio was

756
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,700
this whole patent and intellectual

757
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,310
property encumbered mess that they

758
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,740
managed to get on the air and then just

759
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,930
real two years ago a couple of like

760
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,689
cyber security companies decided they

761
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,509
were going to re-implement this open

762
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,730
source so that they could generate like

763
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,910
malformed HD radio payloads and try to

764
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,190
audit the software in receivers but what

765
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:15,580
this means is that there's no HD radio

766
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:17,140
encoders sitting on github and I'm

767
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,930
thinking you're saying you know so

768
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,759
there's like 40 50 60 usable frequencies

769
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,919
in a market and maybe a hundred pirates

770
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,500
out there and so if you were to have you

771
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,850
know two or three HD channels tacked

772
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,400
onto each one of those there'd be room

773
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,080
for everyone that's so cool that's like

774
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,980
that's a really great idea I mean when

775
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,590
HD radio came out it was this stupid

776
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,640
mess it was it was the worst idea that

777
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,530
you possibly could have come up with

778
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,720
because basically there was a digital

779
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,870
audio in

780
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,629
in Europe that made a whole lot more

781
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,620
sense it was called dr baby yeah there

782
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,880
were a couple of different ones of

783
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,980
digital radio mondiale and whichever and

784
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,530
like the idea was like when you digitize

785
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,650
like a formerly analog medium you can

786
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:03,270
get about five times more content into

787
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,920
the same amount of bandwidth because the

788
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:09,390
inherent and bishan efficiencies of

789
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,760
digital but when they told that to the

790
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,379
American broadcasters they like wait no

791
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,800
that's a terrible idea

792
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:20,100
what how are we gonna fill that all up

793
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,770
and and what their problem was and one

794
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,120
of the things about it was that it was

795
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,430
broadcast in these pods of like five

796
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,410
stations and all the stations would end

797
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,359
up being equal well American

798
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,279
broadcasters like wait a second are you

799
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,440
telling me I spent fifteen million

800
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,390
dollars for my station and like you know

801
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,130
three million dollars for my four

802
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,220
hundred foot Tower and then I'm gonna be

803
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,290
put next to like some dinky hundred watt

804
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,919
low-power FM and we're gonna have equal

805
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:50,070
coverage no way that's not gonna happen

806
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,790
and and so what they did was we need a

807
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,980
digitization that maintains the existing

808
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,259
property relations between the haves and

809
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,210
the have-nots on the FM s and for sure

810
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,950
we don't want any new entrants to get

811
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:06,260
into it so they came up with this crazy

812
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:08,790
system called Eibach in-band on-channel

813
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,140
sort of create like putting gears within

814
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:15,270
gears of trying to like to shoehorn

815
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,790
digital signals in but with really

816
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,980
almost no benefit whatsoever to the

817
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,330
consumer because your average radio

818
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,220
consumer they're they're listening in

819
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,470
their car so they can't actually hear

820
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,080
the difference between FM quality sound

821
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,120
and what they claim to be CD quality

822
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,470
sound you just like over the noisy

823
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,490
engine you you wouldn't hear that

824
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,500
difference and and they made one or

825
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:40,620
possibly two extra channels available

826
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,620
but only to the existing broadcaster the

827
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,270
one that's already on the air they would

828
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,710
get a second channel that most of the

829
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,990
time they didn't know what to do with I

830
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:52,290
think the cleverest idea I heard was

831
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,479
that NPR was going to start doing like a

832
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:57,480
pledge drive free version of their

833
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,020
Montana and so I think they've done that

834
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,369
in a couple places but but the other

835
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,230
thing about it was it was entirely

836
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:06,420
proprietary software so no one could

837
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:12,260
look in and that was adopted as the

838
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:14,670
official you know as as the official FM

839
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,230
implementation of digital radio in the

840
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,880
United States something that no one

841
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,119
could even look inside and figure out

842
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:24,540
how it worked and not only not you had

843
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,490
to pay licensing fees to use the

844
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,070
software not only for the transmitters

845
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,040
but even for the receivers so the whole

846
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,660
thing was was a stupid mess and most

847
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,080
people have never heard of it because

848
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,390
who wants to spend you know $200 on a

849
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,160
radio that's already that doesn't really

850
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,980
do anything that your old radio didn't

851
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,509
already do has basically all the same

852
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,190
stations and doesn't really sound any

853
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:52,410
better so I wasn't aware of that crack

854
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,750
and that's super cool that someone did

855
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:58,350
it because you know so that people can

856
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:00,630
play around with it and you know I mean

857
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:03,420
the problem remains that you're still I

858
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:07,859
Bach is dependent on being inside the

859
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,570
main signal of of an existing FM station

860
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:11,520
so I'm not exactly sure how you would

861
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,609
implement it to get it into the hands of

862
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,470
all the Haitians but it's a great step

863
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:19,470
that someone figured out the technology

864
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,970
part of it so that was I'm sorry I'm

865
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,640
monopolizing the mic there's nobody else

866
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,368
in line here but so I've done a fair bit

867
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,960
of like scanning around the HD channels

868
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:29,820
on the dial back in Detroit where I live

869
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,680
and there's a couple of stations that

870
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,570
have like you know the HD one is a

871
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,149
mirror of the analog soon while the HD 2

872
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:38,550
is typically like an intern in a studio

873
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,530
like practicing and then if they have

874
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,630
three they're like they're taking any

875
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,880
random thing they can find and putting

876
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,100
it on the air and and it's it's great

877
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,040
it's like psychic talk radio shows and

878
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:53,240
all weird but but what I was

879
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,800
thinking is if you've got you know 30

880
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,979
community groups that are vying for one

881
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:03,630
or two LPFM stations it seems like the

882
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:06,510
the time is ripe for LPFM HD to give

883
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,670
three or four of them streams and I

884
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,359
guess that means nobody's

885
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:17,660
yet so somebody in this room step up

886
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:23,359
very cool hi

887
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:25,848
so I guess I have the I was starting as

888
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,190
a computer hacker and in college I ended

889
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:32,150
up just falling into the role of

890
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:36,920
engineer at the radio station and fell

891
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:41,440
in love with it a very big radio station

892
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:44,420
like 3400 watts covers a whole big area

893
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:49,670
my question is about I heard you mention

894
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:55,099
HD radio encoders on github integrating

895
00:41:49,670 --> 00:42:01,309
those with a very old and log broadcast

896
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:05,690
chain has anyone I mean has anyone done

897
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:09,589
this like are there restrictions on are

898
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:12,200
there technical restrictions on I mean

899
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:16,009
because when we lift into HD radio like

900
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,439
and yes what a mess but there was very

901
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:21,079
cost prohibitive to for a small a

902
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,359
shoestring budget College Station right

903
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,380
so I'm just wondering if like the

904
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,598
station could like the college stations

905
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,099
would love to use those a Beach annals

906
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,109
and fill them up there's more than

907
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:37,329
enough demand from like students and

908
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:40,220
community members to run their own shows

909
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:45,049
so just be amazing if there was a more

910
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:46,459
affordable way to you know get them into

911
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:49,700
the 21st century

912
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,380
yeah well that's really cool the I only

913
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,020
know of one low-power FM station that's

914
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,000
actually done HD and unfortunately like

915
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,720
with LPFM you're only starting with 100

916
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,480
watts and so what HD does is that it

917
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,419
puts like either 1% or it's coming soon

918
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,270
I guess it's 10% so you're allowed to do

919
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:10,369
a 10 percent or 10 watt signal which

920
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,579
doesn't get you much you know with LP

921
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:15,859
FM's but to the extent that there are

922
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:17,569
coal stations like existing stations

923
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,470
that are looking for stuff to do with

924
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:20,570
their content

925
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:24,020
I think it's a great idea to use

926
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:30,200
something like the github version the

927
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:31,730
the HD company hi bik wa t they'll

928
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,618
charge you a lot of money for it and so

929
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,090
I generally thought of it as like really

930
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,099
not worth the trouble also there's a

931
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,869
problem of receiver penetration I mean

932
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:42,050
there's just you know one of the reasons

933
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:43,550
I alluded to this before like why is it

934
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,140
that people are still listening to FM

935
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,030
when they have so many choices I mean

936
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,799
with internet radio you can listen to

937
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:52,490
something from any range anywhere around

938
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,660
the world with podcasting you can you

939
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,029
know you can listen to your favorite

940
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,790
program at any time so you're not

941
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:01,490
limited so and you know all these great

942
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,550
innovations but still 53% of listening

943
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:09,140
time is spent with FM and I do think um

944
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:10,220
there's a couple reasons for it some of

945
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,640
them good reasons some of them bad

946
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,649
reasons you know but one big one is that

947
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,240
a lot of the FM listening is shifting

948
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,340
into people's car people are spending

949
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,569
more and more time in their commutes and

950
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,540
so they're spending a lot of time in

951
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:25,730
their cars and a lot of people like me

952
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,460
have old cars you know if you have a

953
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,770
newer car it's like it's more connected

954
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,240
with you know bluetooth and can connect

955
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,700
up to your phone and all kinds of things

956
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,750
but because of the recession of 2007 a

957
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:41,660
lot of people have we bought new cars

958
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:44,390
and so like the you know I do think it's

959
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,660
it's not going to be forever that FM is

960
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,819
retaining this level of irrelevance but

961
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,410
it just keeps on going the longer we

962
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,240
have an economy where like the

963
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,710
super-rich are making all the money and

964
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,770
the rest of us are just making little

965
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:00,050
bits and pieces I think it's going to

966
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:03,140
continue to be surprisingly pervasive

967
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:06,530
another thing is in terms of user

968
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,629
interface when you compare something

969
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,780
like streaming or podcasting or whatever

970
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,940
them I mean FM was kind of genius I mean

971
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,970
there are two dials you know there's a

972
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,640
volume and there's channel and that's it

973
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,160
and like everybody there's like no

974
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,310
learning curve to it also there was an

975
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,870
incredibly pervasive set of receivers at

976
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,090
one time there were nine

977
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,920
FM receivers in the average American

978
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,260
household I mean just think about there

979
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,990
was like one in the shower shower radio

980
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,640
there was like you know Walkman there's

981
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,439
like a boombox there's like you're gonna

982
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,920
wind up there's the one in the car

983
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,720
people you know alarm clocks there's

984
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,760
there's so many of them I think now the

985
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,250
static the statistics gone down to about

986
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,960
five radios are in the in the average

987
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:54,050
household and I know in the average

988
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,600
college dorm there's like zero right but

989
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:00,590
it's it's this enormous bass I forget

990
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,110
how many billion it is of FM radios are

991
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:05,480
just sort of floating around the other

992
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,860
thing about them is they never break so

993
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,020
like if you go into a thrift store

994
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,850
you'll find like an old boom box and the

995
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,860
CD players broken the cassette decks

996
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,540
broke and you know all the other parts

997
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,310
are broken but the FM tuner is still

998
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,410
working so it's just there's like no

999
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:21,080
moving parts really and it just just

1000
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,640
keeps on working so in terms of like

1001
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,170
lessons for design if you're thinking

1002
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,670
about like whether whatever medium

1003
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,560
you're you're doing is going to be

1004
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,050
around in ten years or 20 years or 30

1005
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,880
years that thumbs pretty interesting

1006
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:36,260
that way in how it just keeps on hanging

1007
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,480
on way beyond anyone's real thought that

1008
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,080
it would still be useful I would say one

1009
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,780
more question

1010
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,670
uh-huh so remember in back in pre

1011
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,590
digital TV in the United States there

1012
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,300
was a channel channel six was eighty

1013
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,070
seven point eight megahertz and on the

1014
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,340
analog FM radios you could turn your

1015
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:54,260
dial away the left yeah and and pick up

1016
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,010
a TV station because the standards were

1017
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,650
compatible enough

1018
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,930
hence the band name TV on the radio and

1019
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,720
I remember there was a low-power FM

1020
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,339
station either was a low-power TV

1021
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,980
station or a little power FM station

1022
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,510
that got a license for one and tried to

1023
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,560
broadcast as the other because they

1024
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,270
thought that was more commercially

1025
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,440
viable

1026
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,580
that's all doesn't mean any more now

1027
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,290
that that channels got my mornings

1028
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,090
eighty seven point eight still is it

1029
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,920
been repurposed or is it's still

1030
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,710
available for pirates or people who can

1031
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,810
try and get the FM capture effect to

1032
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,730
pick up a channel there yeah eighty

1033
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,680
seven point seven five I think people

1034
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,960
are still using it in a couple of places

1035
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,339
it's kind of crazy I think with a

1036
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,710
digital transition most of them went

1037
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,200
away but there are still a few

1038
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,750
and they're they're called Franken FM's

1039
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,960
like Frankenstein and I actually know

1040
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:44,089
the guy that did the first one a famous

1041
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,380
community radio guy Jeremy Landsman in

1042
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:51,770
Alaska who actually did it at first as a

1043
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,420
test of whether low-power FM stations

1044
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,520
would cause interference and it worked

1045
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,650
so well that he just he happened to have

1046
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,570
a channel 6 TV license that he wasn't

1047
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,690
using and he just put it on the air and

1048
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:04,190
and then he ended up like running a

1049
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,430
classic rock format on it it was kind of

1050
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:09,859
hilarious so I do think there might

1051
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,470
still be a couple of them around but

1052
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:15,400
with the digitisation of TV and of the

1053
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:19,129
eventual sunset of even LPFM TV

1054
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:24,050
broadcasters LP TV broadcasters they'll

1055
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:28,670
probably eventually go away so I just

1056
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:31,700
wanted to sorry yeah even in 2007 I was

1057
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:34,700
wondering who was listening to FM radio

1058
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:38,750
and so at the college station we really

1059
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,580
tried to branch out by simultaneously

1060
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:45,260
streaming on the Internet and also

1061
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:47,660
recording setting up like every show was

1062
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,369
archived into an mp3 and then used to

1063
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:52,640
slap the feed on to that and then every

1064
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:55,040
show was a podcast we also like

1065
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,080
connected to the campus TV networks

1066
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,990
though there was a TV channel in every

1067
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,650
dorm they could turn to and listen to

1068
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,410
the radio

1069
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:07,940
but I really think that you know

1070
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:11,629
diversifying the ways people who can

1071
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:14,690
listen is great I you have the studio

1072
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:18,470
you're creating the content just whether

1073
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:21,050
it's FM or streaming there's always

1074
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,540
going to be the demand for the actual

1075
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,700
content absolutely it's it's it's really

1076
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,410
crucial and I I tell that to all the

1077
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,020
groups that I work with like FM is great

1078
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:31,279
right now and of course you've got to be

1079
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,259
thinking about what's happening right

1080
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,520
now but

1081
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,440
you know you got to be thinking about

1082
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,360
like how this content can have more legs

1083
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,000
and how it can like how it can go into

1084
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,710
the future and where people are going to

1085
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,560
be listening to it and the important

1086
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:50,410
thing isn't really you know the the

1087
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:53,710
transmission medium it is just a funny

1088
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,379
thing the way that that it's hanging on

1089
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:59,110
because certain very smart things were

1090
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,490
done in its in its early design that you

1091
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:02,860
know that are that are making it still

1092
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,839
really pretty worthwhile I'll tell you

1093
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,280
there there are two projects that I've

1094
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,660
been working on the past couple weeks

1095
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,340
I'm thinking of and one is grouping

1096
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,029
Santa Anna it's a Mexican cultural

1097
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:19,630
center that has just an amazing

1098
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:22,690
constituency of people that are that all

1099
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:26,700
come together for this sort of Mexican

1100
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:30,700
folk music school called the centro

1101
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:33,009
cultural de mexico in santana and so

1102
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,720
they have this incredibly like loyal and

1103
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,300
connected audience so immigrant groups

1104
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,480
are still using the hell out of the FM

1105
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:43,000
band another one that i'm actually going

1106
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:47,020
to work on after this is in Hudson

1107
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,300
Mohawke and in that group you know is

1108
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,130
it's an independent it's an offshoot of

1109
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,300
the old independent media center and

1110
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,610
it's called the sanctuary for

1111
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:57,310
independent media - it's a media arts

1112
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:00,460
center that hosted in in formerly

1113
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,920
abandoned church in Troy New York and

1114
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,390
they do this incredible work they've

1115
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,460
kind of gone away from the old community

1116
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:08,529
radio model of having a different hour

1117
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,740
like the Persian hour and the Latino

1118
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:13,690
hour and whatever instead you know they

1119
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,169
have some music the rest of the day but

1120
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:20,920
but they focus a lot of effort into

1121
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:23,380
every night at six o'clock they have an

1122
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,660
hour of locally produced news and public

1123
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,510
affairs and content and so they have a

1124
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:31,140
team of about forty people that all they

1125
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:34,180
work on is making that Drivetime radio

1126
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,890
incredibly incredibly good no mic going

1127
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,520
head to head with like the local public

1128
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:41,589
radio and the news affiliates and like

1129
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,960
if you listen to it like the the level

1130
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:45,910
of participation and the

1131
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,770
news gathering they're doing I'm just

1132
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,690
incredibly impressed with with what

1133
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,670
they're doing and what they're doing is

1134
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,170
yeah they put in all these different

1135
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,750
mediums but they're making use of that

1136
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:58,390
still incredibly powerful Drivetime have

1137
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:04,210
found listenership to like really do

1138
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:06,970
