1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,350
my name is Amy Stepanovitch I am US

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,040
policy manager and global policy counsel

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,960
at access now which is an international

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,698
organization working at the intersection

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,160
of human rights in tech my friend over

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,109
here will introduce himself I'm Harley

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,769
Geiger and I'm director of public policy

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:29,460
at rapid7 rapid7 is a cybersecurity firm

9
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,709
based in Boston we have offices all over

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,190
and we work on among other things

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,020
IOT security we also have a very active

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,079
research arm which is dedicated to

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,820
finding flaws in software IT and

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,649
otherwise and bringing them to light I

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,670
run our public policy and government

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,460
affairs activities so we're here today

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,760
to talk to you a bit about the Internet

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,399
of Things and the legal statutory

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,870
regulatory environment in that space

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,079
right now and talk to you about what's

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,559
happening in DC and at the state level

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,720
just a little bit the reason that DC

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,729
finally I think started paying attention

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,729
to the Internet of Things has a lot to

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,070
do with this statistic from Intel which

26
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:16,710
law makers have seen of a lot and that's

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,939
that there will be 200 billion Internet

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,869
of Things devices in the world by 2020

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,449
to give you a little bit of math that's

30
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:30,869
200 billion divided by the expected

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,259
population in 2020 is about twenty five

32
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,790
point six devices per person and it's

33
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,950
probably a lot higher than that given

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,570
that only about 50% of the world is

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,210
connected to the Internet so it's it

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,520
will be very connected according to

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,770
people in DC we'll be having a lot of

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
our activities tracked a lot of our

39
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,380
devices in our home are going to have

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:00,270
some sort of connectivity functionality

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:02,520
and so they weren't really sure what

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,649
they could expect people in Congress if

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,450
you if you haven't heard don't always

44
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,449
some of them do but don't always have a

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,459
ton of technical expertise and so they

46
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,170
were trying to figure out in this new

47
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,170
world what needs to be done

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,780
so there are a lot of unanswered

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,319
questions in the IOT space who owns the

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,410
device who owns the data who can collect

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,060
data about me for what reasons can we

52
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,600
protect it all these are questions that

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,480
I think people in DC are really starting

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,780
to figure out and delve into and the

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,679
answers are going to guide any

56
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,340
additional regulation or legislation

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:51,660
that we see however we want these

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:54,920
answers to turn out so to start the

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,690
actual educational portion of the talk

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,298
we wanted to take a step back and say

61
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,109
what is the Internet of Things we've

62
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:06,690
seen a progression of computing devices

63
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,630
over the last few decades moving from

64
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,630
very large computers through to

65
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,579
smartphones that we carry on our bodies

66
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:17,600
all the time essentially sleep next to

67
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,850
all the way down to our smartwatches

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,980
smart toasters toasters are a really big

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,000
thing that we talked about in DC every

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,170
time you talk about the Internet of

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Things it's a toaster

72
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,220
we're gonna use that a lot I'm really

73
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,030
sorry uh-huh

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,799
so why do we think of Internet of Things

75
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,730
items differently than computers charlie

76
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,430
why we think of them as different than

77
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,380
computers I would say that we don't know

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,250
how to classify them very well yet there

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,730
is a great deal of inconsistency in

80
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,370
defining IOT and one of the problems is

81
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,429
if you try to define it it you end up

82
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,670
sweeping in a ton of devices that people

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,829
don't necessarily think of as IOT at

84
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,078
rapid7 we take a pretty broad view in

85
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,450
just define IIT the three general

86
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,819
characteristics it's a physical object

87
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,459
that has some sort of embedded

88
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,170
technology like CPU memory software it's

89
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,540
got Internet connectivity number two and

90
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,149
number three some sort of external

91
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,728
command and control application like a

92
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,289
mobile app or a human machine interface

93
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,770
and so forth and that actually covers a

94
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,380
giant range of devices everything from

95
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,630
small

96
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,170
fitbit's or something like that to a a

97
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,090
battleship and are actually our IOT

98
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,620
research director has come to hate the

99
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,690
term internet of things because it's not

100
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,500
specific enough but it's in his title so

101
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,690
it haunts him forever and for policy

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,330
makers this definitional problem this

103
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,000
definitional problem of IOT is a real

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,590
issue for them because in policy with

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,660
legislation or regulation everything

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,849
will end up getting litigated companies

107
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,680
want to know exactly what is required of

108
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,320
them and for a definition that ends up

109
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,540
encompassing everything from you know

110
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,599
your mobile phone to a you know a

111
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,250
connected car it is it is viewed as too

112
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,800
broad and it lends itself to a lack of

113
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,380
clarity we find this lack of clarity

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,060
among consumers and businesses as well I

115
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,590
mean if your printer is connected to

116
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,650
Wi-Fi well guess what it is

117
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,659
in fact IOT so the definitional issue is

118
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,320
a really difficult one and we have found

119
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,970
that one reason that people don't tend

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,380
to think of it as a traditional computer

121
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,850
is because he doesn't have a keyboard

122
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,150
and a screen it's just it's a different

123
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:35,590
form factor from what we are used to but

124
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,840
IOT it's a encompasses this giant range

125
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,369
of devices so one way that you will see

126
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,739
policy makers and we'll talk about this

127
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,180
a little bit more later start to look at

128
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,530
how IOT should be protected regulated or

129
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,940
voluntarily is pretty sector specific

130
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,890
you know so it'll be medical devices and

131
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,900
just IOT as it relates to medical

132
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,110
devices or just connected cars and so

133
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,169
forth and so from our perspective we

134
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,560
think and from our I mean access now not

135
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,330
our from access now is perspective we

136
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,500
think that ultimately some of these

137
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:13,960
differentiations inform may not be as

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,530
meaningful in the long run and when we

139
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,650
talk about protections looking at

140
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:22,390
necessary security protocols or

141
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,030
processes necessary protections for the

142
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,340
collection of data that should be tech

143
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,309
agnostic and not necessarily delve into

144
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:35,640
which of these devices is collecting the

145
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:38,710
information so what does all this mean

146
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,180
we talk about Internet of Things as

147
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:45,219
hardly said because it brings

148
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:47,620
a lot of new things but these are rules

149
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,180
when we really the the Internet of

150
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,970
Things in the conversations that they

151
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,260
that that is bringing up that that

152
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,370
increase in the Internet of Things

153
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,750
products is bringing out those

154
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,260
conversations should have been had a

155
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,760
really really long time ago and the

156
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,030
reason that we didn't is because they

157
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,620
thought that they could people in DC

158
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,619
thought that they could just ignore the

159
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,030
problem and it would go away they

160
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,020
treated it like they treat a lot of

161
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:17,260
other things where it will all be sorted

162
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,900
out and there won't be serious problems

163
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,159
with security or privacy and there

164
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,330
hasn't been a major catastrophic

165
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,730
security incident necessarily and so

166
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,469
that means that we're doing okay so

167
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,460
we've let it go and let it go and now as

168
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,080
things have gotten more and more

169
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,270
connected we're reaching this kind of

170
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,620
critical turning point where if we don't

171
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,909
do something we could see massive

172
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,980
repercussions and I think we already

173
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,680
have and we'll talk about that a little

174
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,870
bit later when we talk about harm so

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,090
we're going to talk today about common

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,150
vulnerabilities federal law and

177
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,729
legislation state data security and

178
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,090
breach notification laws and federal

179
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,560
agency action and this is a warning that

180
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,299
there's gonna be a lot of text on the

181
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,670
slides ahead I know people have really

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,380
really cute images and I love slides

183
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,600
that are really good we want to make

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,170
sure you have the information available

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,850
on different citations to laws that you

186
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,170
might want to take so we're gonna put

187
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,700
that on the slides and we apologize

188
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:24,310
three major areas in the internet things

189
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:26,800
field privacy security and connectivity

190
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,360
and these are three issues we're not

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,970
going to touch upon all of them actually

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,740
we're only going to look at the security

193
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,040
aspects here today but we wanted to flag

194
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,190
that those two other areas bring a whole

195
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,319
new realm of issues with them we're also

196
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,260
not covering issues about liability

197
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,780
criminal law law enforcement access to

198
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:51,180
data or data protection which are

199
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,180
separate gigantic issues as well

200
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,130
when we talk about security data that is

201
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,600
or can be collected control of the

202
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,790
device itself there are two different

203
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,140
things that you want to secure you want

204
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:14,730
to secure the data you want to secure

205
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:18,270
the device sure sorry so we think of

206
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,280
security as a unauthorized system

207
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,720
actions right as opposed to sometimes

208
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,079
privacy what we're talking about there

209
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,140
are authorized system actions and you we

210
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,660
can we look at IOT harms the harms that

211
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,520
can result from lack of security on a

212
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,439
spectrum so so from greatest to to least

213
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,449
mass injury or loss of life individual

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,250
injury or loss of life damage to

215
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,900
critical infrastructure damage to

216
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,270
property in breach of sensitive

217
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,550
information that spectrum is sort of

218
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,680
where we what we view is at stake with

219
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:55,890
Internet of Things security depending on

220
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:58,260
the situation and the device ends next

221
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:03,150
please keep going we're going to common

222
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,100
vulnerabilities right

223
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,850
so here are some of the common

224
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,790
vulnerabilities that our team finds with

225
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,500
Internet of Things devices so one

226
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,839
insufficient update practices so IOT

227
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,150
devices unlike a lot of traditional

228
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,520
computers will often lack an update or

229
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,740
upgrade path once the device leaves the

230
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,480
manufacturers warehouse and without a

231
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,640
patching capability it then becomes

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,490
difficult to correct the devices known

233
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,640
vulnerabilities especially at a large

234
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,340
scale and so we are facing this wave

235
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,520
right now of devices especially smaller

236
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,520
devices that are unpatch about but also

237
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,400
unsecure and although we have some

238
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,980
confidence that IOT devices will build

239
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,260
in an update capability more commonly in

240
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,150
the future we still will have this wave

241
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,550
of legacy devices installed that we will

242
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,590
have to deal with second lack of

243
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,050
transport security so in our experience

244
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,560
a IOT devices will often fail to use

245
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,920
modern cryptographic standards for data

246
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,800
in transit and that risks expose

247
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,290
user data as it goes through the public

248
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,380
internet or local area networks third

249
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,959
unencrypted storage so IOT devices and

250
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:19,610
related services will often store data

251
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:22,699
in unencrypted formats and so that is

252
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,130
that is if both if it is both stored on

253
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,949
the device but also in the cloud and

254
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,260
third mobile application access a fourth

255
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,329
it's not on there sorry about that but

256
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,209
mobile application access so mobile

257
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,310
applications are often used to control

258
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,989
consumer IOT devices and what we have

259
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,810
found is that those mobile applications

260
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,139
will frequently give greater access and

261
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,359
control greater access to the to the

262
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,690
mobile device than is necessary to

263
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,060
control the IOT device and then UART

264
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,790
access UART as universal asynchronous

265
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,680
receiver transmitter interfaces these

266
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,349
will often enable a physically close

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,930
attacker these lights are really bright

268
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,750
in case you guys can't tell it will

269
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,719
enable a physically close attacker using

270
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,360
a serial cable connection to access the

271
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,880
device and in ways that will bypass

272
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,500
normal user authentication and one of

273
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,110
the things about UART access is that it

274
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,060
typically enables root-level permission

275
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,540
which far exceeds what a normal user

276
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,219
would need backdoor accounts some

277
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,010
manufacturers will occasionally include

278
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,290
a service or default account which is

279
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,230
difficult or impossible to remove under

280
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,910
normal usage especially for your average

281
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,459
consumer and these accounts will

282
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,410
frequently use a default password or an

283
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,510
easily guessable password not just for

284
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,120
one device but for a whole class of the

285
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,390
manufacturers devices and then lastly

286
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,620
lack of segmentation and so this is when

287
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,930
different components of the of a device

288
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,850
share the same memory or circuitry and

289
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,160
so that a flaw and one component will

290
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,640
affect another component so a great

291
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,260
example our cars if you are able to get

292
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,480
into the infotainment system of a car

293
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,339
you should not be able to get into the

294
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,639
mechanical functions of that car it's

295
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,260
it's break and speed but unfortunately

296
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,180
lack of segmentation does make that

297
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,379
possible in many circumstances so that

298
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,758
is a short list of

299
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:21,720
common vulnerabilities that we see in

300
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:24,329
IOT so what exists now to deal with

301
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,619
those at the federal level there are a

302
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:30,539
few different laws that are called data

303
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:31,829
security laws and you'll hear people

304
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,659
talk about them things like

305
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,569
gramm-leach-bliley the Fair Credit

306
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:39,149
Reporting Act the FTC Act these don't

307
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:40,919
actually say much about security other

308
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,819
than requiring some sort of reasonable

309
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:47,069
security for sensitive information which

310
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:49,498
has been interpreted in different ways

311
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:52,079
particularly in the FTC Act which we'll

312
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:54,720
talk about a little bit later there are

313
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,378
some state laws on security the primary

314
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,899
pieces of security that are security

315
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,309
regulation that we see in state laws

316
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:05,459
data breach notification which we'll

317
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,839
also talk about in a little bit the

318
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,248
Federal Trade Commission trying to

319
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,499
respond to what the Federal Trade

320
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:15,089
Commission can and cannot do and there

321
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:16,949
are pieces of the I'm really bad at

322
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,979
these slides advancing things guys I'm

323
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:22,758
really sorry it has two things here and

324
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:25,249
I'm a oneclick above where you guys are

325
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,559
so the Federal Trade Commission's

326
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:30,449
authority or lack thereof and then the

327
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,478
regulations on the ground at the state

328
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:36,149
level so where they can provide some

329
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:38,429
guidance to state regulatory agencies in

330
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,199
order to have things done not at the

331
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:44,549
statutory level but down at the agency

332
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,699
level so I'm gonna talk a second about

333
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:51,389
data state data security and data breach

334
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:53,608
notification law so as of now all 50

335
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:56,850
states actually have a data breach

336
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:58,409
notification law the last being Alabama

337
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,809
most recently Alabama and South this

338
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:03,419
year that's right this year so we have

339
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,219
reached patchwork supreme all 50 states

340
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,289
and the District of Columbia and some of

341
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,649
the territories so Puerto Rico has a

342
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:13,109
data breach notification law also and

343
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,419
these laws I think part of the part of

344
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:17,749
the the calculus is that breach

345
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:21,119
notification is more politically

346
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:22,350
expedient than directly regulating data

347
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:24,059
security and I think that the idea

348
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,130
originally was in part not just

349
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:29,939
transparency for consumers but also

350
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,160
that I the the cost and hassle of

351
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,670
notifying consumers in the event of a

352
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,490
breach would then inspire holders of

353
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,990
personal data to build in security at

354
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,780
the front end so that the breach doesn't

355
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,940
happen and that calculus is not really

356
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,670
working right the the steady drumbeat of

357
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,350
breaches is is showing that it's too

358
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,229
complicated and so states are actually

359
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,000
now starting to move in the direction of

360
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,300
directly regulating personal data

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,060
security there are 17 states as of my

362
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,000
last count that have data security

363
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,560
regulations in place usually they share

364
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,180
some definitions with breach

365
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,760
notifications so the definition of

366
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,979
personal information is usually the same

367
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,319
and there are differences among the

368
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,560
states there's no consistent standard

369
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,540
and so consumers will receive uneven

370
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,310
levels of protection based on where the

371
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,620
data is being held you know or where the

372
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,510
consumer is geographically and this

373
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,200
uneven level of protection also makes it

374
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,350
difficult for businesses of all sizes to

375
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,420
comply with and so that in our view

376
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,240
hampers good security

377
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:39,469
now those differences aside the laws do

378
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,130
follow some consistent patterns also so

379
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,740
for speaking just for data security laws

380
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,060
usually the requirement is a reasonable

381
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,700
level of security and that's the word

382
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,050
that these reasonable level of security

383
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,880
depending on the size and scope of the

384
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,770
business and the sensitivity of the data

385
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,439
we think that that is a good thing

386
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,760
actually that we think you know a

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
gigantic corporation should be held to a

388
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,740
different standard than a small pizza

389
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,689
shop it enables companies and other

390
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,520
holders of data to act based on the

391
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,689
risks you know based on the sensitivity

392
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,639
of the information and so forth but

393
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,670
where it starts to fall down and where

394
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,310
it becomes a bit less useful for

395
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,770
consumers and for IOT will often be in

396
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,859
the definition of personal information

397
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:25,379
so personal information for most of

398
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,770
these laws is stuff like your government

399
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,810
ID numbers so social security numbers

400
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,030
account credentials your address

401
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,649
sometimes biometrics sometimes health

402
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,639
information that's not already covered

403
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,150
by HIPAA

404
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,880
but also this anachronistic name

405
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,250
requirements many of the states require

406
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,420
that your name your actual name your

407
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,100
first and last name or your first

408
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,200
initial and last name be attached to the

409
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,270
data otherwise it does not actually

410
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,390
qualify as personal data so what that

411
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,790
means is a company could have your

412
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,100
social security number your account

413
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,350
credentials you know possibly even your

414
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,230
biometrics but unless unless your name

415
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,250
is also in there then it's it doesn't

416
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,510
meet the definition of personal

417
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,370
information and it's exempt from the

418
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,920
regulation that requires reasonable

419
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,719
security a second thing about this that

420
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,450
is anachronistic is when I talk about

421
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,990
account credentials many but not all

422
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,440
states are limiting that account

423
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,640
credential requirement to accounts for

424
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,980
financial transactions so here we're

425
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,020
talking about your bank login right or

426
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,370
you know your PayPal logged in so it's

427
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,900
accounts necessary to complete a

428
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,239
financial transaction that is different

429
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,620
from your personal media accounts it's

430
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,990
different from your online dating

431
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,729
profile it's different from the account

432
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,880
that may be embedded inside your IOT

433
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,520
device and so so you can see how this

434
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,080
starts to become far and far far further

435
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,240
and further removed from consumers

436
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,500
expectations for security with their

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,560
devices and with their personal

438
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,870
information I think that this is an

439
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,550
example of the law sort of fighting the

440
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,189
battles of the last century really

441
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,139
they're fighting against identity theft

442
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:04,740
when companies and consumers are now

443
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,320
facing a lot more greater diversity of

444
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,390
risks and harms based on cyber security

445
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,280
I will call out four states briefly as

446
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,950
being exceptional in avoiding both of

447
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,590
these problems and that is California

448
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,330
Florida Maryland and Minnesota they do

449
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,129
not have the real name requirement and

450
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,220
they do not limit the account

451
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:31,170
credentials merely to financial accounts

452
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:33,210
and I just want to quickly provide a way

453
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,620
to think about what Harleys saying about

454
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,450
personal data and definitions of

455
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,610
sensitive data

456
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,840
I assume that everybody I cannot see you

457
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,340
if you raise your hand so I'm not going

458
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,310
to ask you to raise your hand because I

459
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,620
can't see any of you but how I assume

460
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,230
that most of you have a credit card or

461
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,949
some sort of bank account number

462
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,740
if that number got lost or breached and

463
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,160
revealed to the public think about just

464
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,500
for a second if you would know how to

465
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,600
respond if you kind of have in your mind

466
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,549
a thought about how to cancel your

467
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,620
credit card number it cancel any you

468
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,270
know recurring payments to that card get

469
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,360
a new credit card and you know how to

470
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,070
mitigate the harm coming off of that now

471
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,418
if you think about the types of

472
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,139
information that Internet of Things

473
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,970
devices are going to collect about you

474
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,150
things like the number of commands that

475
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,910
you give to an Alexa your physical

476
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,280
activity your location and where you are

477
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,049
at any given time I would imagine that

478
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,370
the same number of you who know how to

479
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,590
mitigate the loss of a credit card

480
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,149
number don't necessarily know how to

481
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,149
mitigate the loss of other more

482
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,650
sensitive information that could be

483
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,049
revealed into a database and we haven't

484
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,600
done a lot of research into how to

485
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:47,690
mitigate that type of sensitive personal

486
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,100
information which means that if we were

487
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,390
to create a system that somehow

488
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,189
incentivize companies to do some of that

489
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,559
research because they were going to have

490
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,360
to notify people on the backend we might

491
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,330
be able to walk down a path where we

492
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,860
were looking into that type those type

493
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,799
of harm's those type of non-financial

494
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,870
harms and mitigating those for people in

495
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:14,690
a way that we can't even imagine that

496
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:16,280
they can be mitigated today so I want to

497
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,490
talk a bit about the Federal Trade

498
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,230
Commission the FTC DC really really

499
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,900
loves acronyms this is one of them that

500
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,250
we use all the time nobody says Federal

501
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Trade Commission out loud there's a lot

502
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:32,720
of syllables there the FTC has the

503
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,820
authority to go after companies who

504
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,730
engage in two different types of trade

505
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,629
practices trade practices that are

506
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,549
deceptive that's pretty clear on its

507
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,080
face if you say something and you do

508
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:49,040
something else you have engaged in a

509
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:53,689
deceptive trade practice and easily the

510
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,760
bulk of the FTC's actions in the privacy

511
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,880
and security space were based on this

512
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,200
deceptive prong of their jurisdiction

513
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,410
but they have a second prong and that's

514
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,030
fairness unfairness it means that it's

515
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,840
likely to cause substantial injury to

516
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,360
consumers

517
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,689
that's not reasonably invited and not

518
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,129
outweighed by countervailing benefits

519
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,230
additionally there was a case that was

520
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:21,600
decided in the Eleventh Circuit this

521
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:25,500
year that adds a form of requirement but

522
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,189
kind of reinter causing injury the Act

523
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,530
has to offend public policy as set out

524
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:36,290
in some sort of statute or judicial

525
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:39,990
decision or the Constitution this is a

526
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,670
additional element that people don't

527
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,430
necessarily know how they're going to

528
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:47,070
grapple with just yet because when you

529
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:52,050
look back at reasonable security

530
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:55,200
practices there's not a clear statute to

531
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,149
set out what that means and there's not

532
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,670
a clear judicial decision that says what

533
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,230
is a reasonable security practice and so

534
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,370
there's a little bit of uncertainty

535
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:08,580
right now about how elevating that prong

536
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:11,879
and do a necessary prerequisite for the

537
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,800
FTC to go after companies is going to

538
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,140
play out in the long run and I'm going

539
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,780
to talk about that case and why some of

540
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,280
that it's uncertainty exists but there

541
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:27,600
are four main cases in the in the

542
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,060
unfairness world so the FTC has kind of

543
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,530
started feeling out its ability to go

544
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,100
after companies for bad security

545
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:37,920
practices under it's unfair jurisdiction

546
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,449
starting in 2005 BJ's Wholesale Club has

547
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,090
anybody ever shopped at BJ's Wholesale

548
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,580
Club do you know it no yeah like I've

549
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,159
heard it yet thank you for verbally

550
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,100
affirming what I'm saying

551
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,200
so the FTC here they began to argue that

552
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,480
unreasonable data security measures are

553
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,070
unfair regardless of any public

554
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,590
representation about a company's

555
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,470
security practices so they were they

556
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,159
were leaving behind their deceptive

557
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,720
jurisdiction they were saying you don't

558
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,360
have to say what you have done and then

559
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,670
lied if you do something that offends

560
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,800
basic data security we're going to call

561
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,220
that an unfair trade practice and we're

562
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,830
going to be able to

563
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,909
I started an investigation and and

564
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,100
potentially lead to a consent decree

565
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:23,960
skipping ahead 2014 you know during that

566
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,240
time they they continued to feel out

567
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,770
their ability to use this in the

568
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,340
TRENDnet case this is a case that

569
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,440
involved in secure home security cameras

570
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,408
and baby monitors the company

571
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,909
transmitted user login credentials in

572
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:43,789
clear-text on users mobile devices and

573
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:45,140
they failed to test so the FTC found

574
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,390
that they failed to test consumers

575
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,789
privacy settings to ensure that the

576
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,830
video feeds marked as private would

577
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,379
actually be private because these

578
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,689
credentials were out in the open the

579
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,740
company and the FTC ended up consenting

580
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,770
to that the company had to implement a

581
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,750
comprehensive data security program for

582
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,020
at least 20 years this is a requirement

583
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,820
that the FTC puts upon companies

584
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,110
frequently in the privacy space you see

585
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,059
it often you have to enter in a

586
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,949
comprehensive privacy program for 20

587
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,539
years Facebook is under a consent decree

588
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,309
like that Google is under a consent

589
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,289
decree like that so you see them

590
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,809
starting in the concert in the security

591
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,730
space to say ok what happened in the

592
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,168
privacy space we're going to transfer

593
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,020
over to security and require these

594
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:32,210
comprehensive data security programs for

595
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,799
20 years the company can figure out what

596
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,240
that means but they're going to have to

597
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,889
enter into one and this has been a key

598
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,669
reason why some of the FTC's

599
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:45,799
jurisdiction is called into question

600
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:49,460
2015 we saw the resolution of the

601
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:51,650
Wyndham case Wyndham the hotel chain had

602
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,190
three intrusions into its networks

603
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:58,640
between 2008 and 2010 the FTC said this

604
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,320
was also that their failure to protect

605
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,900
their networks meant that they were

606
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,439
engaging in an unfair trade practice in

607
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,120
regard to security and Wyndham challenge

608
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,169
that Wyndham said they did not have the

609
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,530
authority to go after the company for

610
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:18,080
these sorts of lack security measures

611
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,200
and the FTC won so Wyndham lost that

612
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,168
case the FTC's authority to use its

613
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,760
secure or use its unfair thora t to go

614
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,390
after bad security was preserved

615
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,629
until this year and now we have some

616
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:36,150
interesting questions so the lab MD case

617
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:39,870
lab MD does not exist as a company

618
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:43,440
anymore it was a company that screened

619
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:46,709
people for cancer and at some point he

620
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,850
faxed the case a company employee at lab

621
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,710
MD downloaded LimeWire onto their

622
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:58,139
computer

623
00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:00,960
the LimeWire the files that LimeWire was

624
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,750
able to access included a file that had

625
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,600
sensitive personal information for lab

626
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,980
MDS consumer base and so it uploaded it

627
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,439
into this peer-to-peer serving and

628
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,170
allowed it to be downloaded by anybody

629
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:18,990
who was linking over to that users

630
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:20,310
computer the FTC lab MD notified people

631
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,350
when they found out a security

632
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,020
researcher luckily found the file and

633
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,540
sent it back and said fYI your user

634
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,510
information is all on the internet they

635
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:34,409
notified the FTC and the FTC said this

636
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:36,990
is an unfair trade practice and entered

637
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,300
into one of these are put forth one of

638
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,270
these consent decrees with them and now

639
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,040
I've MD talyn's dit em lab MD continued

640
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,620
to challenge it after the company no

641
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,840
longer existed they found the ability of

642
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,879
the FTC to go after the company very

643
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,730
offensive and so they kept on

644
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,590
challenging on the FTC's authority here

645
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,660
and they challenged it straight up to

646
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,129
the Eleventh Circuit and the Eleventh

647
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,770
Circuit just released its a penny in

648
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,560
this case two months ago I want to say a

649
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,450
month and a half ago and what the

650
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:11,490
Eleventh Circuit said is really

651
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:14,280
interesting here they said that yes lab

652
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,080
MD engaged in an unfair trade practice

653
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,320
and they kind of said this without

654
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,570
really deciding and so this goes back to

655
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,800
the need to tie it to a public policy or

656
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,510
statutory requirement rather than really

657
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,210
delving in and saying that that

658
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,930
statutory or that policy requirement

659
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:36,030
existed they just assumed it did and

660
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,779
this was the court saying we don't need

661
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,700
to make this determination right now

662
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,320
now because you're gonna fail on the

663
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,429
next part of this test that we throw at

664
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,019
you and they thought that they were

665
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:48,549
really holding on a very narrow ground

666
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:51,759
but the ground that they held on was

667
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:56,139
that requiring a information security

668
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:58,450
program was too ambiguous of a

669
00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:01,508
requirement it didn't provide an exact

670
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,580
thing that lab MD had to do and so it

671
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,489
wasn't acceptable it couldn't stand as a

672
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,279
remedy because it didn't necessarily

673
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:10,779
specifically remedy the problem at fault

674
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,849
which the court said could have been

675
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,830
something like don't allow people to

676
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:18,369
download white line wire on their

677
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:22,809
computers anymore so what inadvertently

678
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:26,049
the curt was Court did in trying to have

679
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,820
a narrow holding is really push the FTC

680
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,739
into this world where now when they

681
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,408
enter in these consent decrees rather

682
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:36,849
than having a requirement that could be

683
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:38,769
evaluated determined based on the

684
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:41,320
secured the sensitivity of the data that

685
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:43,690
the company could really figure out now

686
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,089
the FCC has to be super prescriptive and

687
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,879
has to make very specific requirements

688
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:50,559
for companies that may be too arduous in

689
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:53,228
some cases that may be too bureaucratic

690
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,849
that might not actually solve any of the

691
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:58,359
problems but it's going to require the

692
00:29:54,849 --> 00:30:00,849
FTC to have a lot more detail in any

693
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,039
future consent decrees with companies

694
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:05,710
who engage in bad trade practices so

695
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,919
this is a really a live issue right now

696
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,089
I imagine that that is going to they're

697
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,339
still deciding if they're going to

698
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:14,279
challenge it up or if they're going to

699
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:18,158
try to seek further review of this case

700
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,539
but it's actively changing area where

701
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,539
the FTC is allowed to act

702
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:31,419
oh so we're gonna talk a little bit

703
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,110
about why why do we even care about all

704
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,360
of this why does it matter

705
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:39,639
bad security in the IOT world can can

706
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,820
wreak havoc all over the world and in

707
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,040
fact it it has the Mirai botnet which

708
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,530
used to kick the most visited websites

709
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,889
offline around the u.s. and encourage

710
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:53,530
super high costs for a lot of people was

711
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:58,270
made up of a botnet of infected IOT

712
00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:00,460
devices the impact can be heavily felt

713
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,580
in areas like children's toys this is

714
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,110
the Kayla doll that Germany banned

715
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,370
because it was collecting it said too

716
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:11,679
much sensitive information about

717
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:14,260
children to sex toys access now actually

718
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,480
filed an FTC complaint against the sex

719
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,120
toy manufacturer last year because it

720
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,480
was collecting information and

721
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,550
transmitting it in securely the

722
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,440
manufacturer of the sex toy you see on

723
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,740
your screen was fined four million

724
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,420
dollars for collecting way too much data

725
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,640
and they said that they were collecting

726
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,560
more data than they needed to and the

727
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,890
possibility for these type of devices to

728
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,510
be hacked and controlled remotely

729
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,920
outside you know we said arms are

730
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,570
threats to the data threats to the

731
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,300
device hacked and controlled remotely

732
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:52,090
implicates an entirely different problem

733
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:57,639
with security we're already seeing IOT

734
00:31:52,090 --> 00:32:00,100
devices hacked cars guns planes as

735
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,380
things get device connected they're

736
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,530
having real world impact with their

737
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,230
insecurities and essentially this is a

738
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,820
market failure this is with that you

739
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,880
would you say that Harley market failure

740
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,879
I think that there is a wide recognition

741
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,460
that market incentives are not aligned

742
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:23,410
to actually promote IOT security

743
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:26,040
especially in low low-grade products

744
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,630
that have a very small profit margin

745
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,220
security is difficult to build in and

746
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,390
maintain over time it's not something

747
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,040
that you can just do once and then

748
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,170
ignore and and it

749
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,270
it is increasingly apparent to

750
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,300
regulators as well as folks that are

751
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,680
watching this space that the amount of

752
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,530
devices that are coming through that are

753
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,120
not secured are not commensurate with

754
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,000
the market forces that are pushing them

755
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,040
to be secured I'm not sure that we're at

756
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,920
the point where we know exactly what to

757
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,030
do about yet about that yet that is part

758
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,670
of the discussion that we're talking

759
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:02,000
about here this it's a very live and

760
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,800
ongoing conversation but there I think

761
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,170
we're reaching a point where folks are

762
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,310
questioning whether the voluntary nature

763
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:12,200
of many efforts to try to get I o T

764
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,110
secure whether or not that is actually

765
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,590
working and whether consumers are not

766
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,590
too exposed

767
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,640
so in Congress there are we'll talk

768
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,020
about two different laws just briefly um

769
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,770
one is the Internet of Things cyber

770
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:30,500
security Improvement Act this is a

771
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:33,710
requirement for certification on some

772
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,350
level of security and update ability for

773
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,920
devices contracted for by the US

774
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,399
government

775
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:44,090
so devices that the US government

776
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:46,760
procures or rents in some way have to

777
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:51,020
meet some basic level of security and

778
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,440
update ability it also has provisions to

779
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:58,250
protect security researchers who act in

780
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,500
quote-unquote in good faith that would

781
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,800
do a lot in the security researcher

782
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:07,130
space in relation to IOT but we think

783
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:10,009
probably not enough it's definitely not

784
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,380
a perfect proposal but it goes a lot

785
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,120
further than what we have today some of

786
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,540
the vague definitions though I think it

787
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,810
fails we're hardly talked about earlier

788
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,730
where it applies to everything

789
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:25,179
everything from like the teeny tiniest

790
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:29,300
connected device all the way through

791
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:32,510
your gigantic desktop computer that sits

792
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,250
on your on your desk at home we we think

793
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,440
that this is actually the the concept

794
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,870
behind this bill is a very good one I'm

795
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,340
focusing on federal procurement focusing

796
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,049
on the government's own purchasing

797
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,540
dollars is one way to sort of

798
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,149
short-circuit the traditional opposition

799
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,639
that

800
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:50,129
comes when government tries to directly

801
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,809
directly regulate the private sector we

802
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,098
hear very often that it's well

803
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,750
government should clean its own house

804
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,579
before telling the private sector what

805
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,039
to do and that's what this bill would be

806
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,900
aimed at doing but as Amy said it did

807
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,000
run into a media trouble with the

808
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,950
definition of IOT because the definition

809
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,529
that they used which is actually an

810
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,939
accurate definition but it's you know

811
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,680
it's a physical object with Internet

812
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,869
connectivity but that encompasses every

813
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,020
phone every laptop every battleship you

814
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:17,910
know ever every every tank now and and

815
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,890
it became too unwieldy and so the

816
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,160
conversation became how do they scale

817
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:25,558
back that that that broadness so that it

818
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,460
actually becomes practicable but that's

819
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:31,490
that's sort of where the bill is now a

820
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,740
second proposal is the cyber shield Act

821
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,740
this has been in part proposed by

822
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,990
representative Liu and it creates a new

823
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,680
body in the government that will

824
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:46,288
implement or decide on minimum security

825
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,970
standards and if companies IOT companies

826
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:49,950
meet those minimum security standards

827
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,689
they'll get some sort of seal that they

828
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:55,200
can put on their packaging or on their

829
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:57,750
product or whatever they box they're you

830
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,939
know connected car comes in and say that

831
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,710
they have met the requirements on

832
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,670
security and so that is another proposal

833
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:08,010
in Congress right now neither of them

834
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:11,069
have gotten very far is that safe to say

835
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,900
it is the the cyber shields sort of

836
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:16,349
envisions like an energy star style

837
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,880
scheme for for security and although

838
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:21,599
there are other certifications and

839
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,220
standards that are that are out there

840
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,500
there's actually a ton of standards that

841
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,009
are out there for for security this

842
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,380
would be the first one that that is run

843
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,349
or at least facilitated by the federal

844
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,460
government and the way that they had set

845
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:36,869
it up it's not the federal government

846
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,839
sort of deciding the standards it'd be

847
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:42,140
an open process with in collaboration

848
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,490
with experts and the private industry

849
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,750
and on balance we think that it's

850
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,220
actually it's a good idea it's

851
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,069
worthwhile having the Energy Star

852
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,799
program is a big success but that too as

853
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:58,820
Jamie said has has run into into

854
00:36:52,799 --> 00:37:00,990
opposition so Amy covered

855
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,150
the Federal Trade Commission and sort of

856
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,370
what's happening there in courts right

857
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,490
so litigation we talked about some of

858
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:12,420
the state laws and they me just covered

859
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,339
Congress so a federal legislation but

860
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,380
there is this other giant part of

861
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,980
governments which is executive agencies

862
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,350
and so it's a is is worth looking at

863
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,890
what these executive agencies are doing

864
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:28,230
about IOT security and so behold this is

865
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,810
this is the Great Wheel a federal agency

866
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,420
action the great we love acronyms and so

867
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,390
NIST the National Institute for

868
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,070
Standards and technology's right in the

869
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,410
Department of Commerce so this is

870
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:44,820
possibly the most important though least

871
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:47,609
exciting of agencies when it comes to

872
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,710
this issue NIST has is actually very

873
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,140
focused on IOT security they have an IT

874
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,200
security program they have 30-plus work

875
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,450
streams that have some relation to IOT

876
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,310
security many of these work streams are

877
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,450
standards of various kinds technical

878
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,130
standards which is sort of their bread

879
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,160
and butter but they're very in-depth

880
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,860
comprehensive very technical but they

881
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,180
are also pursuing additional initiatives

882
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,190
and I'll just talk about two of those

883
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,890
but remember there are you know some

884
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,150
some thirty of them one of them which

885
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,220
was just recently announced just in the

886
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,040
past couple months is an initiative on

887
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,350
lightweight cryptography the idea is to

888
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,029
have a decently strong cryptography that

889
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,200
can be used in devices that don't

890
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,570
necessarily have a great deal of

891
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,410
processing power so that initiative is

892
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:33,870
kicking off shortly there's also a an

893
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,810
initiative on managing IOT privacy and

894
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,400
security risks which is very fresh they

895
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:42,299
actually just recently had a workshop on

896
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,370
it this is this is last week and it is

897
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,050
right now directed towards federal

898
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,160
agencies so it'd be how federal agencies

899
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,870
managed IOT security and privacy but in

900
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,910
our experience in the past many of these

901
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,100
many of these types of documents that

902
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,379
are aimed at federal agencies can easily

903
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,150
be applied to the private sector as well

904
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,780
and sometimes they become popular enough

905
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,560
with the private sector that they

906
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,960
effectively even though it's supposed to

907
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,450
be for federal agencies it ends up being

908
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,390
for both federal and private sector

909
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,069
but the this this document in managing

910
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,660
IOT privacy and security risks includes

911
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,339
a lot of the stuff that you would want

912
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,089
to see it's talked about supply chain

913
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:23,130
updates device identification

914
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:25,230
organizational and device mitigations so

915
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,970
it is it is relatively comprehensive and

916
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,109
it's in draft form so it's ongoing right

917
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,790
now and there's an opportunity to

918
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:32,040
participate in that is so you if you

919
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:34,160
should so choose next acronym please so

920
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,750
the Food and Drug Administration FDA

921
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,950
have actually been somewhat pioneers in

922
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:43,170
this in this space they some time ago

923
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:46,020
had said that they wanted to see their

924
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,400
medical devices safe that's that's their

925
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,570
original mandate and that safety

926
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,240
includes cybersecurity and as so that

927
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,359
that part is mandatory the devices must

928
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,770
be secure but they've also released

929
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,930
post-market guidance for medical device

930
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,570
cybersecurity which is not mandatory

931
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:07,020
it's quasi mandatory but it says to

932
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:09,119
reach that mandatory goal of security

933
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,359
cybersecurity here is what we recommend

934
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,069
here is what we would do and as with the

935
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,630
the NIST documents I referenced it's

936
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:18,599
relatively comprehensive and one of the

937
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:23,099
things that it says for example is it

938
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:26,550
has a a graph of risks that are severe

939
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,829
and likely likelihood of exploitation

940
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,170
and if you reach a certain points in

941
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:34,020
that in that matrix then you must issue

942
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,950
a recall or issue an update it also has

943
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,920
refreshingly a coordinated vulnerability

944
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:42,750
process requirements so that if if

945
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,490
researchers come to a company with a

946
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,680
vulnerability the company's supposed to

947
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,930
act on it and so forth so that is that

948
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,450
is already out there next please

949
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,368
so this is the National Highway Traffic

950
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,430
Safety Administration's it's my favorite

951
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:57,810
acronym in DC is it and it's a I my

952
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,029
personal favorite is probably still

953
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,549
Patriot probably still Patriot because I

954
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,050
just thought that was wow what a took

955
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:08,250
some creativity there's there are some

956
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:10,109
very skilled acronym makers in DC so

957
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,150
Nitsa so this is part of the Department

958
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:16,049
of Transportation and unsurprisingly

959
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,030
they run traffic safety and they have

960
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,190
made clear that their existing

961
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,160
authorities in terms of the safety of

962
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,869
vehicles also encompasses Cypress

963
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,049
and they have exercised that authority

964
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:31,080
so for example they were behind a recall

965
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:33,930
of 1.5 million Jeep and chrysler

966
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:38,730
vehicles after the infamous Charlie

967
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:40,500
Miller Chris valasek hack of a Jeep so

968
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,290
they didn't need new authority to do

969
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,930
that and and they were recalled over a

970
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:48,150
cybersecurity safety issue in addition

971
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,580
to them exploring what their existing

972
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,250
authorities enable them to do they have

973
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,410
also issued voluntary guidance for car

974
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,920
manufacturers that goes into some depth

975
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:01,279
about car security as a defense in depth

976
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,240
you know a risk assessment pentest

977
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,660
segmentation core Native ulnar ability

978
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,129
disclosure etc this as with FDA and

979
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,379
you'll find this as a pretty common

980
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,510
theme is focused really just on safety

981
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,280
on physical safety next please

982
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:16,950
so the Consumer Product Safety

983
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,220
Commission they recently held a hearing

984
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:24,149
exploring how their existing authority

985
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,180
covers consumer IOT that too limited

986
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,680
just to safety and they actually stated

987
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,480
in submitting comments and as part of

988
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,379
their hearing you know please just focus

989
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,300
on on the hazards physical hazards that

990
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,640
these devices can pose and Amy actually

991
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,890
you had submitted comments to that

992
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,379
hearing we did we will ask them to focus

993
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:47,098
on the criminal aspects on criminal law

994
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,089
specifically at the state level but also

995
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,960
at the federal level does not

996
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:55,140
necessarily anticipate in a lot of cases

997
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,750
crimes that happen because of technology

998
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,580
and so we know arson is a thing and if

999
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:03,810
you set something on fire it's arson if

1000
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:05,580
you caused a toaster toasters to turn on

1001
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,440
and overheat and you set a house on fire

1002
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,720
criminal laws don't necessarily

1003
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,420
anticipate that as being arson and what

1004
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,450
we don't want to happen is for laws that

1005
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:20,310
are already over broadly interpreted and

1006
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:22,439
used to target computer researchers like

1007
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,900
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to be

1008
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,180
expanded unnecessarily in order to take

1009
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,580
care of crimes that should be dealt with

1010
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,440
by traditional criminal law and so we've

1011
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:34,470
asked them to do a survey of criminal

1012
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,900
laws across the country and to see how

1013
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,808
criminal law needs to be adapt

1014
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,369
for crimes that can happen through IOT

1015
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:45,170
devices I think that is an excellent

1016
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:47,930
point or just note though that the okay

1017
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,359
all right that the the Consumer Product

1018
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:53,750
Safety Commission is looking also at the

1019
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:56,180
the straight regulation of the design

1020
00:43:53,750 --> 00:44:00,619
and manufacture of these devices as they

1021
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,609
relate to hazards next so the National

1022
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,819
Telecommunications and Information

1023
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:07,160
Administration they came out with an IOT

1024
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:09,440
green paper it does cover IOT security

1025
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,299
and privacy although not in tremendous

1026
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,859
depth but it talks about the same

1027
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:16,190
familiar things risk management security

1028
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:18,740
by design etc next please the Department

1029
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,799
of Energy FERC actually the Federal

1030
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,959
Energy Regulatory Commission is taking a

1031
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:26,690
more active look at how cyber security

1032
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,000
relates to electrical equipment this is

1033
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,740
IOT in a broad sense so you know

1034
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,910
large-scale electrical equipments that

1035
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,750
you would normally find in things like

1036
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:37,759
power plants next the Department of

1037
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,380
Homeland Security they release strategic

1038
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,220
principles for securing the Internet of

1039
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,799
Things there they talked about you know

1040
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,649
basic security steps that have been

1041
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:50,839
covered in the in the other reports but

1042
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,460
also a call to action for policy makers

1043
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,099
and legislators to use their existing

1044
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,480
authority to look at tort liability and

1045
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:59,990
to look at the possibility of new

1046
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,849
regulation and then lastly the White

1047
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,308
House working with NIST and the

1048
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,869
Department of Homeland Security on

1049
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:07,940
automated attacks and botnets now this

1050
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:10,160
is from an executive order interestingly

1051
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,230
the executive order focused on automated

1052
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,960
attacks and botnets but a great deal of

1053
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,240
the resulting report and work are

1054
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,940
actually focused on IOT no doubt this is

1055
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,250
inspired by the Mirai botnet and there

1056
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,049
it talks also about calling on agencies

1057
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,700
to enforce their existing Authority and

1058
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:28,490
calls in the community to disrupt

1059
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:31,250
attacks and it calls on manufacturers to

1060
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:33,799
make IOT easier for consumers to use

1061
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,510
more securely and calls on manufacturers

1062
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:36,549
to adopt all these voluntary standards

1063
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:40,580
that are out there

1064
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:43,910
next please so

1065
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:46,759
there's a big question in place about

1066
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:49,190
whether IOT manufacturers and operators

1067
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,990
will actually abide by will actually

1068
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,790
adopt all of these standards and all of

1069
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,410
these voluntary documents that are out

1070
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,980
there there are many many of them as I

1071
00:45:54,410 --> 00:46:00,109
hope that run through just demonstrated

1072
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,220
so if and if they don't then what

1073
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,570
happens are we looking at the

1074
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,029
possibility of new regulation which

1075
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,830
itself is an arduous process but will

1076
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,170
will buyers require adherence to these

1077
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,370
standards and will users demand these

1078
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,350
are things that we should be really

1079
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:15,290
vigilant about so we should be watching

1080
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:18,710
these voluntary programs and and be very

1081
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,930
skeptical of calls for new voluntary

1082
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,040
programs or new voluntary standards and

1083
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,379
at the moment that you hear somebody say

1084
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,150
well there should be an IOT security

1085
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,980
standard out there there are there

1086
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,800
there's there's at least a dozen you

1087
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:33,170
know thirty of them or so in addition

1088
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,020
there are ways that we as consumers and

1089
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,640
we as tech-savvy people or we as

1090
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,830
security researchers are able to help

1091
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,779
many of these standards are developed

1092
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:44,240
through an open process where anybody

1093
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,160
can show up and contribute even some of

1094
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,049
the some of the reports that are not

1095
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,589
necessarily standards you can contribute

1096
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:52,850
to them and offer your input there are

1097
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,750
also ways you can vote with your wallet

1098
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:58,750
ul and Consumer Reports are at various

1099
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:02,420
stages of maturity and developing

1100
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:04,460
certifications for IOT to give consumers

1101
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,040
better information about the security

1102
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,600
level of the of a given device the

1103
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,160
Consumer Reports one actually is also

1104
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,420
open so that people from the community

1105
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,200
can come and contribute and give their

1106
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,760
feedback and then lastly if you have the

1107
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,160
the skills to do it

1108
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,080
there are legal ways perfectly legal

1109
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,080
ways to actually examine the security of

1110
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,250
IOT the that last logo there is the

1111
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,020
Copyright Office the Copyright Office

1112
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:30,530
has actually issued some pretty

1113
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:34,610
forward-looking regulations scaling back

1114
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:38,300
the section 1201 of the DMCA prohibition

1115
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,590
on on circumventing technological

1116
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,450
protection measures this is this is

1117
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,910
actually one major way that security

1118
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,379
researchers found themselves in legal

1119
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,330
trouble and they there are there they've

1120
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,950
actually put forth a means for

1121
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,500
researchers to conduct that kind of

1122
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,210
research while avoiding that liability

1123
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,590
as long as you're not

1124
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,570
making other laws and as long as you're

1125
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:59,270
doing it responsibly and solely for

1126
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:02,570
security as opposed to money then you

1127
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:04,009
you are able to look at the security of

1128
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,960
IOT devices and bring it to the

1129
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,940
manufacturer with the goal hopefully of

1130
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,810
a positive resolution like a patch and

1131
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,900
greater public transparency and that is

1132
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:16,940
all that we've got in terms of time I

1133
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,580
think we thought that we had an extra 12

1134
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,590
minutes but apparently we don't - if

1135
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,970
anybody has a burning question or we can

1136
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:26,500
answer them please remember that we

1137
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,500
cannot see your hands if you raise it

1138
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,550
I understand that there's a microphone

1139
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,359
and that's what we should be listening

1140
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:52,400
to Mike I understand this is not exactly

1141
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,990
your problem but I just wanted to ask

1142
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,170
this because of the title of the talk

1143
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,669
and so on so you have a large large

1144
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,420
networks like this with nodes that

1145
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:04,070
operate with varying rules and so on

1146
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,360
emergent behavior that can emerge in any

1147
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,090
kind of system like that

1148
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,100
at what point what number of Internet of

1149
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,360
divided Internet of Things devices does

1150
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,830
it take before you start seeing

1151
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:17,000
nonlinear non mechanistic behavior

1152
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:20,299
consciousness you know self-awareness

1153
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and do those kind of phenomenon that

1154
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,300
could start rippling around could that

1155
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,040
be an issue as well I will meditate upon

1156
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,840
that on my plane ride home I don't know

1157
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,340
the answer I'm sorry but I think it I

1158
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,700
think it probably depends a great deal

1159
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,540
on on the type of devices right I mean

1160
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,520
if they're all if they're all the same

1161
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,860
device that consciousness is extremely

1162
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,970
limited if you have devices that focus

1163
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,160
on a bunch of different aspects of

1164
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,470
reality then you start to approach the

1165
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,620
singularity maybe you know in a you know

1166
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:53,870
by a small degree next question so I was

1167
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:56,359
thinking about the statement of how do

1168
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,670
we get people to care about the security

1169
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,770
of all these IOT devices and you

1170
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:04,250
mentioned consumer reports and like

1171
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,810
their rating system and I wondered how

1172
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,110
could we get people to care about that

1173
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:11,110
like the IHS did in the 90s with car

1174
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,940
safety because I feel like that wasn't

1175
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:16,490
as much in the public eye they really

1176
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,410
made a big deal of it and then now it I

1177
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:20,240
thought it seemed through manufacturers

1178
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,569
responded that oh we have to do good on

1179
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,120
this test a little bit of this I think

1180
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:29,390
is and this will be the last question is

1181
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,569
going to be protecting vulnerable

1182
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,890
populations when you had car safety

1183
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:37,040
regulations put into place things like

1184
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:39,140
seatbelts they were to make sure that

1185
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,670
even like the cheapest vehicles that

1186
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,819
were out there we're providing a level

1187
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,860
of security that was necessary in the

1188
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,450
IOT space a lot of times when you talk

1189
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,620
about regulation you hear innovation

1190
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,540
you're gonna kill innovation with

1191
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,640
regulation what we really want to do is

1192
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,529
make sure that even the products that

1193
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,629
are being purchased by the lower

1194
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,970
socioeconomic classes

1195
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:02,060
are providing a baseline minimum of

1196
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,919
security that other people are going to

1197
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,259
be able to afford by virtue of being

1198
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,940
able to afford things and that is that

1199
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,350
one of the big things to get to and I

1200
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,720
would just very quickly point out I

1201
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,910
think we had automobiles for 750 years

1202
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,709
before we had seatbelts and we are still

1203
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,770
at the very very much at the knee of the

1204
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:21,620
curve of what IOT is is going to do and

1205
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:23,210
but we had horrible car accidents for a

1206
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,980
very very long time before safety

1207
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,040
standards were really put into place and

1208
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:30,340
save so many lives thank you ever thank

1209
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,340
you everybody

1210
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,280
[Applause]
