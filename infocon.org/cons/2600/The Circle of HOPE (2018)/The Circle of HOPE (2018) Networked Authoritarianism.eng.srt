1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Oh data money and repression are turning

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,410
the world upside down and how we can

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,320
fight back so guys we have an actual

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:15,690
fascists in the White House

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,850
this shit's up right and I don't

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,948
know about you guys but it's been over a

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,500
year and a half and I still wake up most

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,029
most mornings faintly hoping that it was

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,640
all some really weird trippy nightmare

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,509
but then I look at my phone and I'm like

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,570
oh right right but even then it still

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,340
seems too crazy to be true like this is

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,710
a thing that happened yesterday

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,600
the president's lawyer secretly taped

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,410
him discussing a payment to a playboy

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,180
model like and that's before the Justice

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,029
Department released the Carter page FISA

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,530
warrant application yesterday and if you

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,020
guys need some more evidence that things

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,760
are deeply deeply messed up you might

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,199
want to give Amy siskins weekly list of

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,899
things that are subtly changing around

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760
you and many of them suddenly about as

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,410
subtle as a ton of bricks but they're

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,899
coming so fast that we barely have time

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,908
to process one thing before the next one

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,740
happens anyway I want you to ask

28
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,450
yourselves when did you first realize

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,449
we'd slipped into an alternate timeline

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,549
this was mine

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,479
I'm an optimist by nature and I've

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,548
really really held on to the belief that

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,649
Trump couldn't possibly win for as long

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,380
as I could but when the Cubs won the

35
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,610
World Series even I had to admit that

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,179
the world no longer worked the way I

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,179
thought it did

38
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,350
get warts it's good it gets much worse

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,119
than baseball of course so here are just

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,689
a few examples of scary things that have

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,090
happened recently Palantir secretly

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,589
using new orleans to test a predictive

43
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,630
policing technology without the

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,670
knowledge of the City Council movie past

45
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,408
CEO bragging like this is a good thing

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,329
about how his app tracks your location

47
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,209
before and after movies this is from a

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,859
local Fox affiliate in Memphis I'm sure

49
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,410
you've all heard of this about the those

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,480
Amazon Alexa machines recording a

51
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,579
private conversation that a couple was

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,920
having about hardwood floors sending it

53
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:23,690
to a random contact who was one of the

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,708
one of the two people's coworker and

55
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,299
Amazon would just come like oh yeah

56
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,970
that's a bug we should probably work on

57
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:34,590
that no biggie Alexa again Marriott

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,549
going to start putting them in hotel

59
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,850
rooms are you comfortable with that yeah

60
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,850
me neither

61
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,859
venmo people use venmo here I know a lot

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,859
of people do I'm resisting very strongly

63
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:52,470
I like my checkbook I like cash

64
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:55,470
nevertheless really really weird stuff

65
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,299
about how if you do use it the default

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,739
setting is that all your friends can see

67
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,430
who you're sending money to and what

68
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,819
that's for

69
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,769
like why like I don't understand why

70
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,078
people like who wants that seriously and

71
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,170
that's before you get into how all that

72
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:12,810
data is used in the backend to create a

73
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,700
social net to develop the network map of

74
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,440
who hangs out with who who sends who

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,959
money in what way is what all those

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,940
relationships are like this is data that

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,579
is really of revealing at an individual

78
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,630
level but it is massively revealing

79
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,650
almost unimaginably so at a mass level

80
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,220
here's another one anyone from

81
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,220
California

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,110
yeah so digital license plates rolling

83
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,540
out some of you may have caught the talk

84
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,760
earlier today that went into a little

85
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,880
bit of license plates and how they can

86
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,299
be used to track you know where people

87
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,340
are up to the up-to-the-minute

88
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,650
california's looking at some even

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,880
weirder stuff that up to and including

90
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,220
having ads play on the bat on your rear

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,209
license plate to target the person who's

92
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:08,320
sitting behind you on the five like

93
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:11,590
traffic's not bad enough right facebook

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,570
our favorite people giving device makers

95
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,810
deep access to data on their user on

96
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,358
users and on their users friends all of

97
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,760
this stuff for those of you who were who

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,200
are here for the previous hour my friend

99
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,960
and colleague Laura Reed was talking

100
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,120
about how ranking digital rights is

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,580
pushing tech companies to be more

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,590
forthcoming about the kinds of data that

103
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,270
they collect on users and on non users

104
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,460
for that matter and what they do with

105
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,109
that this is not something that they

106
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,039
ever disclosed before journalists start

107
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,960
digging and it's not just the tech

108
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,190
companies the telcos and companies and

109
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
all kinds of other industries are

110
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,250
getting into it too so AT&T and Verizon

111
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,140
are really really horny to start running

112
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,210
massive ad tracking ret networks to

113
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,060
rival Facebook this is something that

114
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,020
the AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the

115
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,120
code conference not long ago AT&T has an

116
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,190
amazing amount of data customer data for

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,350
40 million paid TV subscribers in North

118
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,080
and South America a hundred and thirty

119
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,300
million mobile subscribers 16 million

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,919
broadband subscribers we have really

121
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,479
great customer insight on what kind of

122
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,849
shows and media content they're viewing

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,120
where they are all kinds of information

124
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,400
on the consumer can you pad can you pair

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,140
a very formidable ad inventory with a

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
very formidable amount of data and

127
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,490
information on the customer viewership

128
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,800
data and all kinds of other information

129
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,510
and can you create something unique

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,860
just from a straight advertising

131
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,050
platform and change how you're

132
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,700
monetizing content this guys excited

133
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,950
about this I'm not and this is before we

134
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,390
even get into the super super scary

135
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,610
stuff that's going on in China

136
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,229
example which is something that gyruss

137
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,150
Kahn talked about on Friday during his

138
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,130
talk on the internet Health Report

139
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,929
if you didn't catch that talk I really

140
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,219
recommend you look it up when the videos

141
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,660
go live in the coming weeks so there's a

142
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,280
third that ties all of these different

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,530
things together and that's what I'm here

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,179
to talk about today all of these

145
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,700
headlines all of these data points and

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,070
many many more are evidence that we here

147
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,170
in the US and globally are slipping into

148
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,340
something that I call and that other

149
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,350
people are calling networked

150
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,549
authoritarianism so what is that as

151
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,760
Bernie mentioned I'm a newly recovering

152
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,860
academic so bear with me here

153
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,140
so networked authoritarianism is a term

154
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,340
coined by Rebecca MacKinnon who you may

155
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,860
know from the book consent of the

156
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,090
networked from Global Voices ranking

157
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,400
digital rights and a bunch of other

158
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,030
really cool projects and her article

159
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,979
which came out in 2011 focused on China

160
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,429
in the Chinese context but the

161
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,400
phenomenon is much much bigger than that

162
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,770
so networked authoritarianism involves a

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,299
single ruling party remaining in control

164
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,240
while a wide range of conversations

165
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,860
about the country's problems still occur

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,410
on websites and social networking

167
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,180
services the government follows this

168
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,220
online chatter and sometimes people are

169
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,200
even able to use the internet to call

170
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,270
attention to problems or in justices and

171
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,880
even manage to have an impact on policy

172
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,919
as a result the average person has a

173
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,020
much greater sense of freedom and may

174
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,910
feel that he or she has the ability to

175
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,270
speak and be heard in ways that were not

176
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,710
possible under classic authoritarianism

177
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,930
at the same time and the networked

178
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,479
authoritarian state there's no guarantee

179
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,100
of individual rights and freedoms those

180
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,370
from the rulers see as threats are

181
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,890
jailed truly competitive free and fair

182
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,960
elections are not held and the courts

183
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,479
and the legal system are tools of the

184
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,340
ruling party some familiar to anyone a

185
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,290
couple of years ago I started to study

186
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,719
on networked authoritarianism in Russia

187
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,410
and I'd had to change my study pretty

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,120
pretty quickly when the the the 2016

189
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,550
election hit and and so I focused my

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,560
study on how the theory of networked

191
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,039
authoritarianism helps explain Russian

192
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,830
foreign

193
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,998
see under Vladimir Putin and

194
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,710
specifically the extraordinary influence

195
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,869
operations that started in Eastern

196
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,149
Europe and gradually extended to Western

197
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:12,430
Europe the UK and of course the United

198
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:14,379
States I won't go into the full article

199
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,629
here it's open access you can find it

200
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,430
online pretty easily or you can scroll

201
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,149
up and down my Twitter feed I am pretty

202
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,619
good at self-promotion shamelessly but

203
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,539
the TLDR is that Russian political

204
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:28,029
elites from Putin on down see

205
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,800
information not as a human right but as

206
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:33,189
a threat to their kleptocratic hold on

207
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,409
power the color revolutions of earlier

208
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,169
in this century the Arab Spring and the

209
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,909
mass protests in Russia around 2011-2012

210
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,010
in particular really really freaked out

211
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,958
the Kremlin so they started to crackdown

212
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,430
in the internet using some of the same

213
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,529
tactics that they used to control

214
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,439
broadcasting and print media as well as

215
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,480
some new tactics that we'll talk about

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
at the same time countries in Eastern

217
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,319
Europe and the former Soviet Union that

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Russia traditionally sees as part of its

219
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,920
rightful sphere of influence we're

220
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,440
moving closer to the US and to the EU

221
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,899
both economically and in terms of values

222
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,329
and politics so Russia started launching

223
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,290
cyberattacks the Estonia one is perhaps

224
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:12,819
the most well known earliest example as

225
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,120
well as interfering and public discourse

226
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:18,849
and elections to stop this trend it

227
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,519
works so well look at Hungary and Poland

228
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,069
for example that they set an even higher

229
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,529
goal dismantling the current world order

230
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:31,389
by taking aim at the EU and the US and

231
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,870
here we are and it's not just Russia far

232
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,730
from it

233
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,010
just this week the Oxford internet

234
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,690
Institute released an empirical fact

235
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,430
based study documenting the spread of

236
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,000
computational propaganda around the

237
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:46,300
world so if you look at you probably

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,920
can't see this too well and I can't

239
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,920
either because I need new glasses

240
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,490
no it's not that it was my poor eyesight

241
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,380
but thank you for your concern oh oh you

242
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,329
can't see so if I'm sorry don't worry

243
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,269
about me but if they can't see because

244
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:05,949
of the lights anyway so they found

245
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,620
evidence that this year in 48 different

246
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:10,510
countries up from 28 the previous year

247
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,490
at least one political party or

248
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,569
government agency was using using social

249
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,600
media to manipulate

250
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,860
public opinion domestically most of this

251
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,149
growth came from countries where

252
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,370
political parties were spreading

253
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,019
disinformation during elections or in

254
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,550
countries where government agencies feel

255
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:26,079
threatened by junk news and foreign

256
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,699
interference and are responding by

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,670
developing their own computational

258
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,589
propaganda campaigns in response in a

259
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,670
fifth of these countries the researchers

260
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,440
found evidence of disinformation

261
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,329
campaigns operating over chat

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,810
applications like whatsapp telegram and

263
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,089
WeChat computational propaganda is

264
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,219
increasingly using paid advertisements

265
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,920
and search engine optimization on a wide

266
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,529
array of Internet platforms and this is

267
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,389
a really big business since 2010

268
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,040
political parties and governments have

269
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:55,720
spent more than half a billion dollars

270
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,939
on the research development and

271
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,610
implementation of Sai cops and public

272
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,560
opinion manipulation over social media

273
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,990
in a few countries this includes efforts

274
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,279
to counter extremism but in most

275
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,839
countries this involves the spread of

276
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,509
junk news and misinformation during

277
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,050
elections military crises and complex

278
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:17,410
humanitarian operations so how did we

279
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:20,370
get here exactly so let's go back in

280
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,500
time to the early 90s late 80s early 90s

281
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,000
and because I'm a recovering academic

282
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,819
and I feel the need to compulsively add

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,500
citations to everything I'm dealing with

284
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:33,729
that by having screenshots of articles

285
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,360
that I read so that's you know my name

286
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:40,810
is Natalie I'm a recovering academic

287
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,610
thanks guys so if you were so if you

288
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,219
remember the late 80s and early 90s

289
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:49,209
which frankly I don't but I've read a

290
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,490
lot about it there were a lot of people

291
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,310
who are really optimistic that with with

292
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,220
the fall of the Soviet Union and a wave

293
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,680
of democratization across not only the

294
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,339
former Soviet Union but also parts of

295
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,279
Africa parts of Latin America various

296
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,110
places all over the world that we were

297
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,300
arriving at this end of history

298
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,310
right thanks heard right there that

299
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,529
electoral democracy and liberal humanist

300
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,119
values and free-market economics had won

301
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,889
the day and that history was going to

302
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,389
keep marching in this direction towards

303
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,689
greater serendipity at happiness and

304
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,010
wonderfulness for everyone so that

305
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:29,469
didn't really work out

306
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,839
obviously but at the same time a lot of

307
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,480
people were thinking about in about it

308
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,570
in terms of convergence rather than one

309
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,540
one socio-political economic system

310
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,850
winning over another that the old the

311
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,599
old communism and the old capitalism of

312
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,010
of the 20th century we're gonna converge

313
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,940
into something that would kind of look

314
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,829
like Sweden or the Nordic other Nordic

315
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,630
havens that are not quite nearly as

316
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:57,040
perfect as we like to think that they

317
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,750
are but they're fun you know it's a nice

318
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,750
utopia that we have in mind about like

319
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:05,829
you know the Sweden inside my head right

320
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,079
as opposed to the real Sweden but of

321
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:11,229
course that's not really what happened

322
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,729
what actually happened is that the

323
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,529
international community is now facing

324
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,329
and unhoped and this article was that

325
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,870
I'm quoting from it was written in 2015

326
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,670
so this was before anyone before hardly

327
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,810
anyone was taking Trump seriously as a

328
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,699
political force the that instead of the

329
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,069
best of all possible worlds the

330
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,779
international community was dealing with

331
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,120
and I'm not in unholy trinity of

332
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,660
authoritarian politics cutthroat

333
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,040
economics and Big Brother surveillance

334
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,319
even though we might not all be eating

335
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,029
off even though we might all be eating

336
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:45,310
off IKEA table we're listening to

337
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:47,290
Spotify and reading the latest Girl with

338
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,899
the Dragon Tattoo knockoff we are not

339
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,990
living in a giant Sweden our world is

340
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,339
converging in a far more dystopian way

341
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,199
after two successive conservative

342
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,970
governments and with a surging far-right

343
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,459
party pounding its anti-immigrant

344
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,899
drumbeat even Sweden seems to be heading

345
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,329
in the same dismal direction the US has

346
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:12,670
been slouching toward liberalism for

347
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:15,250
some time now and the authors worried at

348
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,979
the time that while America had not yet

349
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,620
descended into despotism the convergence

350
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,589
was hardly complete and it might be only

351
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,240
be one we might only be one right-wing

352
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:28,899
populist leader away from that

353
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,100
worst-case scenario the call is coming

354
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,100
from inside the White House

355
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,940
so how do data and money play into this

356
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,920
there's the Citizens United decision and

357
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,510
partisan gerrymandering of course which

358
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,729
give the Republican Party a structural

359
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,230
advantage and that's very very important

360
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,940
but I'm here to talk about the role of

361
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:55,380
technology and specifically of data

362
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:56,640
flows back to nerd story time I'm sure a

363
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,860
lot of you are familiar with the phrase

364
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,960
liberation technology but I bet a

365
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,000
smaller a somewhat smaller number of you

366
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,370
have read Larry diamonds article about

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,280
liberation technology and there's a lot

368
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,740
of good reasons to critique the phrase

369
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,780
but I do think that the article has some

370
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,720
really important lessons for us they're

371
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,910
in large part because the article

372
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,920
contrary to what some people think when

373
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,839
they hear liberation technology did not

374
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,449
say the technology was inherently

375
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,850
Liberatore quite to the contrary it said

376
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:31,260
that while at that time so in 2010 while

377
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,730
information communication technology and

378
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:37,069
in particular the internet and social

379
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:40,140
media we're being used for a number of

380
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:44,640
positive pro-social pro-democratic Pro

381
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:47,760
Human Rights Pro good stuff ways that

382
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,680
this was far from the only means for

383
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,340
that the only impact that technology

384
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,770
could have on human societies and it

385
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,390
also pointed out very importantly that

386
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,610
it's not like the Internet is the first

387
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,300
technology to have altered human

388
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,880
societies in such a way in the 15th

389
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,079
century the printing press dramatically

390
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,210
changed the accumulation and

391
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,590
dissemination of information which led

392
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,410
to the Renaissance the Protestant

393
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:16,320
Reformation the Scientific Revolution

394
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,560
etc and on these four foundations modern

395
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,210
democracy emerged but the printing press

396
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,949
also facilitated the rise of the

397
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,980
centralized state and prompted the

398
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,990
movement towards cents toward censorship

399
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,640
similarly a century and a half ago the

400
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,610
Telegraph was supposed to promote peace

401
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,830
and understanding as the news traveled

402
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,680
faster than ever before this led to the

403
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,260
very first intergovernmental and

404
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,550
international bodies to regulate the

405
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,050
flow of information and to make sure

406
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,430
that technologies could talk to each

407
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,000
other that when you're you're telling

408
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,160
that you're tell

409
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,170
that actually didn't need to be printed

410
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,000
out at the French border copied out into

411
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,500
paper walked over to Germany and then

412
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,630
retyped back into Morse code but what

413
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,970
followed in spite of the Telegraph in

414
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,470
spite of radio was not peace and freedom

415
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,790
but the bloodiest century in human

416
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,170
history and so what what diamond wrote

417
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,000
was that today's enthusiasts of

418
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,740
liberation technology could be accused

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,079
of committing the analytic sins of the

420
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,030
Victorian forebears technological

421
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,490
utopianism and current of centricity

422
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,410
that is the e catism that one's own

423
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:26,160
generation is poised on the very cusp of

424
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:28,050
history thank you so moving on to later

425
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,050
in the article which it is a good read I

426
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,030
do recommend it that mobilizing against

427
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,550
authoritarian rule only represents one

428
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,700
possible liberating use of digital IC

429
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,480
t's these tools can also help to whiten

430
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,180
the public sphere

431
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,220
create a more pluralistic and autonomous

432
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,350
arena of news commentary and information

433
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,900
there can be powerful instruments for

434
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,100
transparency and accountability

435
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,780
documenting and deterring abuses of

436
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,969
human rights and of democratic

437
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,010
procedures they can also liberate people

438
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,870
from poverty and ill health they can

439
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,950
convey timely information about all

440
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,459
sorts of things

441
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:08,370
prices help with microfinance map

442
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:15,720
epidemic outbreaks etc etc computers can

443
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:20,610
be vote can be good right yeah so about

444
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,870
that so the thing with the the thing the

445
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,699
thing with those first few years above

446
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,189
the 21st century is that regular people

447
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,750
like us figured out how to use computers

448
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,970
and how to make the most of them a lot

449
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,140
faster than then governments and

450
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,700
companies did for the most part

451
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,260
especially especially then then

452
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,350
governments did but they caught on

453
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,410
pretty quickly and they developed these

454
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,179
these different tactics for controlling

455
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,460
the flow of information something that

456
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,530
that scholars call information controls

457
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,110
and Ron Deibert

458
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,250
and and the other scholars who worked

459
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,760
with him at the on the open net

460
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,470
initiative conceptualize these in terms

461
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,420
of generations and their non generations

462
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,710
in the sense that they go boom boom boom

463
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,450
one after another with a

464
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,919
discreet beginning and end although

465
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,200
that's not how human generations work

466
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,669
either is it it's more about they

467
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,070
appeared in the certain order and

468
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,480
different countries can combine tactics

469
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,750
from different generations they can

470
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,669
leapfrog that can move around it's it's

471
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,980
maybe not the best analytical tool but

472
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,080
it's it's one that it works for me at

473
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,029
least so we started with access

474
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,970
restrictions and DNS blocking things

475
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,350
like the Great Wall of China relatively

476
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,200
crude technical blocking that was

477
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,490
relatively easy to to circumvent and I'm

478
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,630
willing to bet that there are people in

479
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,309
this room who have worked on some of

480
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,409
these earliest censorship circumvention

481
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:39,450
tools or perhaps work on some of the

482
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:41,659
more the more recent ones before long we

483
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,100
moved on to adjust in time blocking and

484
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:46,049
to Internet shutdowns where around

485
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,918
specific protests specific political

486
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:52,770
events governments would just either put

487
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,929
in filters or types of content blocking

488
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,710
or just flat-out pull the plug on the

489
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,779
Internet

490
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,250
around these specific events where they

491
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,659
feared that people would use the

492
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,200
internet and social media to communicate

493
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:08,190
to mobilize and and basically get in

494
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,270
their way more recently we saw turn to

495
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,370
disinformation and propaganda as well as

496
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,990
the the what some people have called the

497
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,239
REIT arataura ization of Internet

498
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,250
governance so using the I star

499
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,559
organizations and the various mechanisms

500
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:26,549
of global Internet governance to

501
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,279
enshrine authoritarian principles in the

502
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:31,980
way the global Internet itself works so

503
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:38,190
for example if you remember the that I

504
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:39,570
can transit transition or with yeah

505
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,130
thank you the I on at the I Ana

506
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:47,100
transition whether the the US government

507
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:51,179
essentially but gave I'm simplifying

508
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,039
vastly but essentially gave ICANN to the

509
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,260
to the international community there

510
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,330
were a lot of countries who wanted the

511
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,850
governance of ICANN in a Vienna in

512
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,439
particular to be based on nation-states

513
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,689
and to be based on the one country one

514
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,850
vote principle rather than having

515
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,399
companies and civil society and

516
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,840
individual peoples and people in the

517
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,159
technical community as well being

518
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,659
involved and

519
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,890
the problem with that of course is that

520
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,880
well first of all I don't think IANA

521
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,580
would work very well without the

522
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,430
technical community but second and most

523
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,340
importantly there are more countries and

524
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:29,490
in the UN that are opposed to freedom of

525
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,560
expression and to privacy and to human

526
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,200
rights online and in the real world then

527
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,120
then not and so fortunately that was

528
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,000
blocked but that's the kind of conflict

529
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,120
that I'm talking about here and more

530
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,790
recently we have the the really rapid

531
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,959
explosion of attention hacking which is

532
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,550
something that we've been talking about

533
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,190
kind of throughout this conference of

534
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,850
flooding flooding the public sphere with

535
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:57,000
with trunk information and and

536
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,909
misleading content and and just

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,410
really to keep - to make it harder for

538
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,120
people to pay attention to the news that

539
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,400
actually matters and to tell what's true

540
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,909
to tell the difference between truth and

541
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,770
then lies so now we get to surveillance

542
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,620
capitalism which is a really essential

543
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,790
part of networked authoritarianism so as

544
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,159
I as I think of networked

545
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,770
authoritarianism it's it's the

546
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,300
information controls that that are kind

547
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,370
of an evolution from classic

548
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,620
authoritarianism plus surveillance

549
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,260
capitalism which is what we're living

550
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,870
with here in the West and specifically

551
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,250
in the u.s. so surveillance capitalism

552
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,959
of course is the business model for the

553
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,240
Internet and it's how we get you know

554
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,770
quote unquote free content and services

555
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,430
but it's also an infrastructure for

556
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:43,170
total social control I think folks here

557
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,640
at hope are going to know a lot already

558
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,900
about how this corporate corporate

559
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,870
surveillance feeds into government

560
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,730
surveillance since 2013 we have known

561
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,100
about prism we've known about upstream

562
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,840
we also know about companies like

563
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,179
geofeedia or whatever it calls itself

564
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,070
these days that grab social media data

565
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,590
and sell it to law enforcement agencies

566
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,870
and of course governments Canon do use

567
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,419
legal processes as well as extra legal

568
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:09,989
processes to demand information related

569
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,090
to specific individuals I fundamentally

570
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,920
believe that surveillance capitalism is

571
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,240
incompatible with the human right to

572
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,240
privacy and with civil liberties

573
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,700
thank you it feels good to not be alone

574
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,309
moreover and this part is really

575
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,280
important algorithms don't treat people

576
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:36,080
fairly there's been some really amazing

577
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,230
work recently including these two books

578
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,449
here by sofia Noble and Virginia Eubanks

579
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,280
that explained the differential impact

580
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,260
that technology has on people depending

581
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,420
on their race their ethnicity their

582
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:52,300
gender their immigration status and how

583
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,500
wealthy or how poor they are and now

584
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,720
since Trump and since brexit in

585
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,880
particular we're starting to understand

586
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,000
how surveillance capitalism also enables

587
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,679
media manipulation media manipulation is

588
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
not new far from it

589
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,850
but big data analytics and targeted

590
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,850
advertising allow for surgical precision

591
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,350
at a massive scale it's becoming clearer

592
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,928
and clearer to me that surveillance

593
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,209
capitalism is a direct threat to free

594
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:22,190
expression to access to information and

595
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:24,770
to democracy itself so the stakes are

596
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,140
high guys they're really high

597
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,879
and this is what I think about all day

598
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,240
this is what keeps me up late at night

599
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,309
this is what gives me anxiety it's three

600
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,900
minutes to midnight all the alarms are

601
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:39,940
going off and it's time for an all-out

602
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,690
fight so what can we do about it

603
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,490
well there's a lot of different things

604
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,960
we can do starting with legislation and

605
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,540
regulation whether that's at the city

606
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,520
level the state or provincial level the

607
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,320
national level this headline is read in

608
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,100
reference to the proposed honest ads Act

609
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,149
which would impose the same kinds of

610
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,300
transparency and reporting obligations

611
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,910
on online political ads as are the case

612
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,610
for radio and TV broadcasting ads as

613
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,800
well as n print ads for that matter at

614
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,678
the super national level like the GD P R

615
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,809
I think I think it's too early to tell

616
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,360
exactly how the GD P R is going to play

617
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,090
out if it's going to be four letters to

618
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,090
save us all probably not that's that's

619
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,040
placing too much hope in anything but I

620
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,139
do think I do think it's a big deal you

621
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,340
know if you look at the fact that that

622
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:34,160
Facebook for example moved the data from

623
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,800
everyone it possibly could from its

624
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,820
Ireland data centers to its US data

625
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:43,220
centers in order to in in order to be

626
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,980
able to continue targeting and

627
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,370
collecting and using data of as many

628
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,990
users as they could get away with but

629
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,000
you know what they still they don't have

630
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,450
a mechanism for somebody to assert that

631
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,790
hey I'm in EU citizen I'm in the u.s.

632
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,350
please treat my data in Ireland you know

633
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,879
if anybody knows of such a mechanism

634
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,500
please let me know but I'm just waiting

635
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:10,940
for a really good class-action lawsuit

636
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:13,670
to join looks like y'all have somebody

637
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,350
is on that one so another tactic we can

638
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,700
use and that was the the subject of the

639
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,110
previous talk which a few missed you

640
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,480
should look up when the video comes out

641
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,600
its corporate social responsibility

642
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,220
companies are going we're going to need

643
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,409
to use the power of the law to force

644
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,330
companies to do the right thing but we

645
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,860
still need to ask them to do the right

646
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,659
thing and to pressure them to

647
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,610
voluntarily improve their practices

648
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,570
related to privacy free expression and

649
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,159
other human rights the UN guiding

650
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,530
principles on business and human rights

651
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,080
are very clear about this companies have

652
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,879
a duty to respect human rights States of

653
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,939
course have the primary obligation to

654
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,130
protect human rights and both states and

655
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,060
companies have a duty to provide

656
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,190
meaningful remedy to you know basically

657
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,889
a Pottery Barn rule you fix it you break

658
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,330
it but companies do have a

659
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,230
responsibility to protect human rights

660
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:09,919
and anyone who tells you that it's not

661
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,020
Google or Facebook or lyft or uber or

662
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,810
Amazon's responsibility to do the right

663
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:21,670
thing is full of it is

664
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:24,350
[Applause]

665
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:26,210
so I wanted to point to the great

666
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,740
example of ranking Digital Rights and

667
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,250
its corporate accountability index as

668
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,330
one mechanism to push companies to do to

669
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,190
do the right thing and that was the

670
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:38,330
subject matter of the of the previous

671
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:40,040
talk but also tech employee efforts to

672
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,169
pressure their leadership to reject

673
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,970
contracts with ice for example to step

674
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,450
back with to step back from facial

675
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,890
recognition projects and other dystopian

676
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,990
Horrors like that are super super

677
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,120
important and so if you work for a tech

678
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,040
company especially a big one one of the

679
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,659
most powerful things you can do is to

680
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,980
speak up at work and put pressure on

681
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,799
your leadership to do the right thing

682
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,850
and if you're in a position to do so you

683
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,650
know we all have you know

684
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,809
responsibilities to you know feed

685
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,880
ourselves feed our families take care of

686
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,678
our loved ones and you know I don't

687
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,010
begrudge anyone having a job that they

688
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,450
can live on you know if if your job is

689
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,220
developed with your job or the job of

690
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,870
someone you know is developing Alexa

691
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,059
skills for example consider getting a

692
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:28,428
different one you don't have to work on

693
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:30,290
things that are that are immoral another

694
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:32,120
big part of the solution is media reform

695
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,730
media reform is more than just the

696
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,020
internet guys and my friend Victor

697
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,610
Picard from the University of

698
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,010
Pennsylvania has been doing some really

699
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,479
tremendous tremendously important work

700
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,410
on reforming the American media

701
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,750
ecosystem this is not a full list but

702
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:51,350
some of his recommendations include

703
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,870
restoring net neutrality restoring the

704
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,370
Fairness Doctrine which until a few

705
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:02,059
decades ago required broadcasters to

706
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:07,340
actually present actually fair and

707
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:08,870
balanced news imagine that right we need

708
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,000
to break up monopolies whether these are

709
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,040
horizontal monopolies but also we need

710
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,799
to we need to think about legislation to

711
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,570
break up the the vertical integration of

712
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,129
these media companies right they just

713
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,020
have they just have too much power and

714
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,850
they have too much power and they're

715
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,190
motivated the system is structured so

716
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,159
that their primary responsibility is to

717
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:31,850
deliver cash to their shareholders not

718
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,340
to educate not to inform not even as

719
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,350
silly to entertain but just to keep us

720
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,740
watching ads so that they can make a lot

721
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,889
of money and that needs to stop

722
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,500
we also need to we also need reform to

723
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,270
diversify ownership of media have you

724
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,030
guys been following Sinclair's attempt

725
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,010
to buy up everything yeah I'm dimly

726
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:57,440
seeing a lot of fainting or a lot of lot

727
00:29:52,010 --> 00:30:00,919
of Norton that was a Freudian slip

728
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,470
I'm dimly seeing a lot of nodding so it

729
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:06,070
does look like like the FCC is going to

730
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,539
block some of Sinclair's latest tricks

731
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,100
but the fights not over guys they're

732
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:14,110
gonna keep going at it and they're gonna

733
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,908
keep making journalists read completely

734
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,428
awful Orwellian statements on air about

735
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:21,650
the the glory of the Republican Party or

736
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:24,559
like whatever they come up with

737
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:26,750
that week we need to fund public service

738
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,428
media we need to support independent

739
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,919
journalism like there's all these things

740
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:34,039
that go into it and this is the result

741
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,049
of decades-long campaigns from all sides

742
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:39,799
but primarily from from corporate

743
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:42,230
America frankly to diminish the role and

744
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:45,918
the power of independent journalism of

745
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:51,500
public interest media and of anything

746
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,510
that is not profit really so in the same

747
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,549
way that we all share part of the

748
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,460
responsibility for environmental damage

749
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,990
and climate change I think we're all

750
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,000
responsible for fighting surveillance

751
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,870
capitalism and its natural consequence

752
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,549
networked authoritarianism so I invite

753
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,590
you to challenge yourself to not

754
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:12,710
participate in surveillance capitalism

755
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,689
if you don't have to and here again I

756
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,909
think conservation efforts are a really

757
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,799
useful analogy because none of us here

758
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,480
have a zero carbon footprint I certainly

759
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,210
don't but we still have a responsibility

760
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,950
to do our best even if we can't be

761
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,690
perfect so think of it in terms of harm

762
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,570
to reduction there's no way that we're

763
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,309
all going to be able to to completely

764
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,530
divest ourselves from google from

765
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:36,200
facebook from ride-sharing apps from

766
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,750
online ad tracking from all of these

767
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,850
things that that are that are coming

768
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,940
together to contribute to this to this

769
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,740
nightmare that we're all in to get

770
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,940
purity is impossible but that doesn't

771
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,520
mean that you can't do a little bit

772
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,200
better so here here are some of my least

773
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,180
favorite consumer products and services

774
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,010
that I would invite you to maybe not

775
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,910
throw into the sea because that's bad

776
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:02,080
for the ocean but to at least destroy

777
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:05,290
with a hammer just abstain from home

778
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,189
speakers why like I don't see the point

779
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,620
of them like laziness and like the

780
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:14,470
novelty aspect of it but none of it is

781
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,790
worth the mass surveillance that we're

782
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,660
inviting into our homes and the

783
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:22,149
normalization of always-on everywhere

784
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,340
mass surveillance nothing is worth it

785
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,690
and I'm gonna give you a little piece of

786
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,970
homework because again I'm a recovering

787
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:38,050
academic talk to your friends and family

788
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:40,180
about not having home speakers another

789
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,850
another consumer service that that I'm

790
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,170
really hating these days is movie pass

791
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,639
I'm not gonna ask for a show of hands

792
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,880
because I don't I don't think shaming

793
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,930
people is really the point

794
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,740
but movie movie pass is just a data suck

795
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:59,170
that's all it is it's it they're they

796
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,700
don't really have a business model they

797
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,160
keep making contradictory statements

798
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,740
about what it's going to be but it's all

799
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,240
predicated on VC's belief that if you

800
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,950
can just suck up enough data about

801
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,510
consumer behavior you're gonna be able

802
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,490
to make money off of it someday and

803
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,440
that's wrong and that's exactly the

804
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,050
problem that I'm talking about so if you

805
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,230
have movie pass consider getting rid of

806
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,580
it please another something else I hate

807
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,740
is venmo and we talked about that a

808
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,240
little bit earlier in addition to the

809
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,050
fact that it's connected to Peter Thiel

810
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:36,600
who's an absolute monster

811
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:39,010
I'm swimming you're booing him what

812
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,639
yep you said I have no doubt that that's

813
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,310
the case

814
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,610
 that guy that's right Peter

815
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,610
teal

816
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,850
so you know get back to cash I'm

817
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,050
actually planning to take a this is my

818
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,580
first time making this commitment in

819
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,200
public I'm gonna do an all cash

820
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,350
experiment for a month I haven't figured

821
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,570
out which month yet but I'm gonna try to

822
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:04,030
I'm gonna try to other than you know my

823
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,220
rent and my utility is to use only cash

824
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,870
for a month oh and I'm promising to

825
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,679
write it when I do it I promise to write

826
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:14,918
about it and let you know how it goes

827
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,090
finally ring that's that's Amazon's a

828
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,310
home security system

829
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,460
that shit's a nightmare guys

830
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:23,560
like have you ever you may have seen the

831
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,320
stories in the New York Times and a few

832
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,899
other places recently about how Internet

833
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,840
of Things connected home devices are

834
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:35,020
being used by domestic abusers to to

835
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,570
control and Gaslight and harass their

836
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,199
victims that's just the tip of the

837
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,000
iceberg

838
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,580
these things are just bad like don't do

839
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,350
that like you know like having a home

840
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,210
alarm system is one thing but you do not

841
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,918
need a camera at your front door you do

842
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,960
not need a camera in your living room

843
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:54,569
you definitely don't need a camera in

844
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:57,820
your bathroom just just say no guys

845
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,410
in closing before we move on to

846
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,950
questions I want to leave you with this

847
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,609
quote from Ursula K Le Guin we live in

848
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,919
capitalism its power seems inescapable

849
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:11,140
so did the Divine Right of Kings any

850
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,900
power can be resisted and changed by

851
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,000
human beings and the operative term here

852
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,450
is human beings

853
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,890
computers alone will not save us

854
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,779
technological solution ism is what got

855
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,180
us into this mess and it's only going to

856
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,740
drag as a deeper into it if you listen

857
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,990
to Facebook's talking points for example

858
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,609
the Zuckerberg is basically claiming

859
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,669
that the solution to the problems caused

860
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:38,440
by Facebook is more Facebook and that's

861
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:41,410
nonsense more recommended reading I

862
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,270
there's a both by by my colleague Siva

863
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,759
Vaidhyanathan from the University of

864
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,530
Virginia there's a New Yorker piece and

865
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,370
if you're interested in more his book is

866
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:54,090
really really good so thank you guys and

867
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,089
I look forward to your questions

868
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:06,240
I think I think we know the drill by now

869
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,410
go up to the mic keep in mind I can't

870
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,660
really see you just go ahead hey Natalie

871
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,069
this talk was awesome thank you

872
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,529
so much thanks Alison

873
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:19,020
my your advice about talking to people

874
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:21,329
about their IOT in their home I think is

875
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,319
really really good my experience is that

876
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:27,779
people are really defensive and so my

877
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:30,000
question is let's say you go to your

878
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:32,549
friend's house and you know they're

879
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,789
having people over and you see an Alexa

880
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:39,059
in the corner and it's on and maybe it's

881
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:42,329
like speaking at people or whatever what

882
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:44,460
do you do so I've been dealing with that

883
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:47,250
a lot I have have several close friends

884
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,049
who have Alexa's in their homes and

885
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,250
their their awkward conversations

886
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,480
because yeah they're your friends and

887
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,660
you love them and you don't want to like

888
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,039
have you know having an tag you know you

889
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,538
don't want to clash with them like that

890
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,250
and you're not there to talk about work

891
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:04,200
if this is you know it's like me this is

892
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:06,690
like work you know I like to I like to

893
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,808
start by asking questions so oh when did

894
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,460
you get this why did you get this what

895
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:15,869
what what's help what do you find

896
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,260
helpful about it did you hear did you

897
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,930
hear that

898
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:22,829
have you heard these news stories about

899
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:24,240
insert latest Alexa kerfuffle what do

900
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,490
you think have you had anything like

901
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,209
that happened to you and then you can

902
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,910
just say you know I don't like them I I

903
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,440
don't I'm not comfortable with them and

904
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,940
then you know you can see how the

905
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,309
conversation goes and I doubt one

906
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,950
conversation is going to do the trick

907
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:44,569
certainly hasn't for me yet for you know

908
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:49,980
the people in my life who have them but

909
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:51,538
I'm hope that they're listening and you

910
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,390
know I think also talking about it in

911
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:56,099
terms of you know a duty to our social

912
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,200
environment you know it's not just about

913
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,880
you and your data it's about what this

914
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,399
is doing to all of us and how this is

915
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,970
all taking us down this really really

916
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,039
dark path but I also wouldn't rule out

917
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,629
and that's really a very individual

918
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,760
decision and I'm not quite there yet but

919
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,780
do I make it there is to start letting

920
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,730
people know that

921
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:24,750
not comfortable being in in rooms where

922
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:26,250
there's an Alexa present hi I actually I

923
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,040
can tell you from experience though

924
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,930
though Alexa's give us all very visceral

925
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,490
and emotional reaction telling people

926
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,049
like what the hell is wrong with you

927
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,879
you're an idiot if you have this that

928
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:41,250
doesn't work all that well totally

929
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,810
personal experience though I I did tell

930
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,550
my partner before the holidays that if

931
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,930
anybody gave us one I was destroying it

932
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:52,880
for a hat with a hammer and putting the

933
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:54,960
video on YouTube so I'm curious about

934
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,850
something let me tell you a story so I

935
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,190
recently worked on a project that is

936
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,990
involved in getting smart phones and

937
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,970
tablets into every hospital in New York

938
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,419
City in the hands of patients in the

939
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,189
hands of caregivers doctors everyone and

940
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm I don't know if I should feel like a

941
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,030
bad person about this because this is a

942
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,520
way that technology is now becoming a

943
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,830
you know an integral part of all the

944
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,850
data that is ever going to be generated

945
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,790
about you in a hospital on the other

946
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,680
hand like the thing that spurred this

947
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,750
and got all these grant money on board

948
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,879
was that all the research indicating

949
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:30,170
improved patient outcomes from having

950
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,460
better data where do you draw the line

951
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:36,600
when you're talking about those kinds of

952
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:40,140
you know really big scope you know data

953
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,400
Revolution projects that's a really big

954
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,900
question and not one that we're gonna

955
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,650
answer satisfactorily today

956
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:49,440
unfortunately but I think asking asking

957
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,720
questions rather than just you know I'm

958
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,430
the one yet you know you're bit you know

959
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,890
we're all super busy during the work day

960
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,390
and when some new policy gets rolled out

961
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,950
most people are just like at least

962
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,330
that's how I usually am a lot of time

963
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,830
like how is it gonna impact my

964
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,690
day-to-day okay I'm gonna have to change

965
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,759
how I do this thing or I'll have to go

966
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,140
to this training but okay let's just do

967
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,150
what I need to do and then move on to do

968
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,759
the stuff that I care about ask

969
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,850
questions say like why why is this

970
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,970
particularly important or okay so what

971
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:20,370
how are what kind of what what kind of

972
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,709
encryption are we using on on these

973
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,330
systems and it's likely the first person

974
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,250
you ask isn't gonna know they may not

975
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,810
even understand the question

976
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,750
but it's important to ask these

977
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:33,600
questions and and push back and another

978
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:36,630
one that's really important in the in

979
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:39,029
the healthcare context I think is what

980
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,170
do we do if we get hacked what if we do

981
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,970
what do we do if we get ransomware

982
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,610
there's been some really really scary

983
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,029
real-life cases recently as well as a

984
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:50,670
like absolutely like edge-of-your-seat

985
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,870
like episode of Grey's Anatomy last

986
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,050
season

987
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:57,420
no but I'm not I'm not I'm kind of

988
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:01,230
joking but I'm also kind of not like TV

989
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,270
like TV portrayals of or other like

990
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,560
fictional portrayals of the kinds of

991
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,740
concerns we're talking about can be a

992
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,880
really powerful way to get across to

993
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,660
people who haven't really thought about

994
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,040
that before like think about how useful

995
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,200
Black Mirror has been in terms of

996
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:23,700
providing us with a language to talk

997
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:27,899
about some of this stuff thank you can

998
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,520
you get in line happy to talk afterwards

999
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,380
but we need to follow the process Thanks

1000
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,490
so you mentioned the the Fairness

1001
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,410
Doctrine and that's pretty much policy

1002
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,660
required as broadcasters to present

1003
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,100
multiple sides of matters that are of

1004
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,810
importance to the public right that's

1005
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,310
right and one of my concerns with this

1006
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,770
policy actually is that it kind of lends

1007
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,210
itself to the attention hacking

1008
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,060
techniques that you've mentioned before

1009
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:53,520
where people can manufacture and then

1010
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,320
try to teach a controversy on issues to

1011
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,820
distract people from other issues or to

1012
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,900
make it difficult to actually pass these

1013
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:06,150
sorts of like get get the correct sides

1014
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,500
of issues in front of the public mm-hmm

1015
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:12,090
I'm just wondering do you have any ideas

1016
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:14,010
on how we can avoid using the making

1017
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,510
these tools things that will lend

1018
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,490
themselves to the people we're trying to

1019
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,920
thwart in the first place sure so I

1020
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,779
think I think this really speaks to the

1021
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,670
importance of professional experience

1022
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,550
well-paid journalists and editors you

1023
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:33,300
know it's it's the role of a journalist

1024
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:35,670
and an editor to figure out what is a

1025
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,500
valid viewpoint what is a real viewpoint

1026
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,810
versus something that you know like as

1027
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,520
you say is just made up to

1028
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:46,560
to distract the the conversation

1029
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,920
unfortunately journalists and editors

1030
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,509
and other is in the news profession

1031
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,100
don't get paid nearly enough to make a

1032
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,590
living you know like how many I'm sure

1033
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,360
we all know lots of people who started

1034
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,640
out in journalism and now work in PR

1035
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,430
because that's how you pay bills right

1036
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,960
and so I think that's where you know

1037
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,430
funding journalism and making sure that

1038
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,410
we have enough journalists and editors

1039
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,240
that they can do a thorough job at

1040
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:16,140
vetting exactly these sort of things is

1041
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:18,990
super super important thank you I guess

1042
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:23,250
I'll start with an anecdote a guy I know

1043
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,259
who was in Oaxaca in the 2000s who sees

1044
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,170
himself as a pretty anti-surveillance

1045
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,230
guy posted an ad I saw a couple months a

1046
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,960
couple weeks ago said I'm looking for a

1047
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,270
housemaid and it said we have a Google

1048
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,970
nest thermostat so you can control your

1049
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,230
temperature from your smartphone so my

1050
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,189
response was pretty sharp to that but

1051
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:48,180
but but I I might I keep his hearing

1052
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:50,010
talks like this that say try to do

1053
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,839
without this surveillance technology and

1054
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,310
oh no we're not gonna try to make you do

1055
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,350
without that one cuz nobody could do

1056
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,940
without that one and well why on earth

1057
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,470
would you do use until without this one

1058
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,690
and we all have to have different views

1059
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,480
about which ones you can't live without

1060
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,890
which ones there's no point in using but

1061
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,520
it's clear we haven't that don't have a

1062
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:11,100
consensus about that so I think maybe it

1063
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,160
might be good to have a little that I'm

1064
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,230
just a little perspective that this is a

1065
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,359
battle getting rid of these things as a

1066
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,870
battle to be fought on many fronts and

1067
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,310
maybe there should be some kind of this

1068
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,740
sounds ridiculous for some kind of

1069
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:28,110
social media site where people talk

1070
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,819
about which ones they're getting rid of

1071
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,620
why it's important to get rid of these

1072
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,410
things how it's possible to get rid of

1073
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,850
them and just tell them help get it get

1074
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,759
support from others and doing this

1075
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,020
because the support could help so I'm

1076
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,700
just throwing that out there maybe

1077
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:46,530
somebody can create that social media

1078
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,180
site and yeah and and one and one and

1079
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,000
one other thing since you mentioned

1080
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,430
independent media please pay money to

1081
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,740
your so the media is good

1082
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,970
if you're not paying money to an

1083
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,399
independent media person you're gonna

1084
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,709
get shitty media so hold fun look for

1085
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,660
out not first so independent media hold

1086
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,090
fundraisers for them send them story

1087
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,450
tips write articles for them send them

1088
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,920
photos

1089
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:12,359
it really helps thanks great thank you

1090
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,910
it's okay guys I did not make the

1091
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,670
disclaimer that words had to finish with

1092
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:23,759
a question so well and there's these

1093
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:25,290
were all really good points sorry the

1094
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,970
more closer to the mic it's a little

1095
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,830
short for you one of the paradoxes of an

1096
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,049
open community is the more vulnerable it

1097
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,220
is to bad actors and attention hijacking

1098
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,690
we've kind of seen that here we're a

1099
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,419
very small number of people have managed

1100
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,460
to hijack the online conversation so

1101
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,960
what are some defenses against that for

1102
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,720
a community or a society also a

1103
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,120
balancing free speech sure well so

1104
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,220
that's a question that is it's almost an

1105
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,630
eternal one right and I have a point of

1106
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,740
view on it and you asked me for my point

1107
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:54,660
of view so that's the one that I'm gonna

1108
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:56,700
share I don't think that the free speech

1109
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,560
rights of Nazis are more important than

1110
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:03,990
everybody else rights everybody else's

1111
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:06,990
rights let me let me rephrase that and

1112
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,629
is a positive statement I do believe

1113
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:13,290
that the rights of people and

1114
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:15,210
specifically of women of trans and

1115
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,400
gender non-conforming people of people

1116
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,070
of color of people with disabilities of

1117
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,680
people who are marginalized in any way

1118
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:26,130
shape or form their right to participate

1119
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:31,339
and be safe is more important than

1120
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,340
anyone's right to be a vocal fascist

1121
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,860
that's not a prescription for government

1122
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,210
censorship however that's a frequent

1123
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,100
confusion about what the First Amendment

1124
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,770
actually means the First Amendment is

1125
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,799
about government banning speech that's a

1126
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,870
separate question I'm talking about

1127
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,790
private spaces which includes the hope

1128
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:56,220
conference you know where there are

1129
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,600
there's a policy for who can be admitted

1130
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,819
and who cannot it's called a wristband

1131
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,980
there is a process for who gets to speak

1132
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,110
and who and who doesn't and who gets a

1133
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,090
platform with a mic and who doesn't and

1134
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,370
so on and so forth and there is

1135
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:11,100
absolutely no reason that in a context

1136
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,140
like that but organizers can't make

1137
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,750
decisions about what is and is not

1138
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:18,779
allowed and a code of conduct is a

1139
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,550
really great place to start but you also

1140
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,280
need informant enforcement mechanisms

1141
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,080
and in my experience attending and

1142
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,180
helping organize a number of conferences

1143
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,759
in both tech and human rights spaces you

1144
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,399
have to think through specific scenarios

1145
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,290
and think and kind of game out ahead of

1146
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,940
time what's going to what could happen

1147
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,259
and how you're going to deal with this

1148
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,920
and how you're going to communicate

1149
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,510
about it and about your response to the

1150
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,340
community and there's always room from

1151
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:48,420
improvement and I think there's a lot to

1152
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:51,420
learn from from you know everything that

1153
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,740
went down here this weekend and I hope

1154
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,450
that's a conversation that won't be

1155
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,379
continuing to have in a thoughtful way

1156
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,379
in the weeks ahead

1157
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:08,610
again you mentioned how some of these

1158
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:10,660
services that people use are

1159
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:14,410
indispensable or otherwise you know

1160
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,759
difficult to replace as an example in

1161
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:18,580
British Columbia for example

1162
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,020
ride-hailing is illegal you cannot get

1163
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:25,480
an uber or a lift there now there are

1164
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:29,170
efforts to changes legislatively which

1165
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,720
I'm working against now I'm wondering

1166
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:35,890
with the obvious caveat that entrenched

1167
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,109
interests gonna entrench is our

1168
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:41,549
legislative options political options

1169
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:45,880
viable against some of these more

1170
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:48,130
egregious abuses of information not only

1171
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,950
are they viable they're absolutely

1172
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:53,740
necessary politics is how you organize

1173
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:56,200
people together to agree on the rules

1174
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:58,379
for a common Society it's become a dirty

1175
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,040
word it doesn't have to be a dirty word

1176
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:10,270
participating in the political process

1177
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:13,420
is how we get out of this hey I love to

1178
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:15,580
talk and I'm happy that you chose to

1179
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,800
pick on movie paths because one I'm a

1180
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,810
movie path subscriber I'm sure some some

1181
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,950
people in this room might be and it's

1182
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,470
one of those things that like if I

1183
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,509
describe it I run the risk of like you

1184
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,339
know advertising for it it sounds too

1185
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:29,290
good to be true like a lot of these

1186
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,540
things you know personally I don't care

1187
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,890
about Facebook but movie paths it's like

1188
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,290
it's so cheap that could be my entire

1189
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,580
entertainment budget and I think for a

1190
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,070
lot of people you know especially people

1191
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:41,259
might not make a lot of money it's like

1192
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:45,400
how do you how do you give that up and I

1193
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,440
think like a lot of these services it it

1194
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,050
kind of it might take advantage of

1195
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,030
people who don't have the resources to

1196
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,070
spend the full price of a movie ticket I

1197
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,260
just wonder like how do you know how do

1198
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,910
we address that how can we how can we

1199
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,550
convince people that these things are

1200
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,170
evil and maybe they shouldn't use them

1201
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:05,320
when it's too good to be true

1202
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:07,990
like it's a really great question and

1203
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,480
the question of inequality visa vie

1204
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,919
privacy is a super-important one I'm

1205
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,150
getting notes that a note that

1206
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,950
the times almost up but you know so if

1207
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,539
you look at if you look at smart phones

1208
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,910
at smart phones

1209
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:24,410
you know the phones that protect your

1210
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,690
privacy the best or that gives you the

1211
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,969
most options to protect your privacy are

1212
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,380
by far the most expensive ones there are

1213
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:33,200
really cheap Android phones that are

1214
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,519
popular like I've you know in all kinds

1215
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,578
of low-income communities around the

1216
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:40,899
world are not not only do they not get

1217
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:43,910
software updates which you know is bad

1218
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,579
but they also come pre-loaded with a lot

1219
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,899
of malware of stalker where of all kinds

1220
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:49,640
of stuff like that so it's much bigger

1221
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,349
than just movie past though that's of

1222
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,709
course a really great example of it and

1223
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:57,349
I think the point there is not to try to

1224
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:58,940
convince the low-income people who can't

1225
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:02,329
afford anything else to behave

1226
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,579
differently because you know they have

1227
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:08,869
immediate needs that they need to meet

1228
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:10,849
but to work on an elite public opinion

1229
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:13,369
the people who have the power to get

1230
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:16,670
across to legislators and regulators and

1231
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:19,910
people and with power making abilities

1232
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:22,459
inside companies to rethink that and to

1233
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:25,910
work against it but ultimately I think

1234
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:27,499
that again I think Paulette politics has

1235
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,269
to has it we're not going to get there

1236
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,618
without politics and we're not going to

1237
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:33,948
get there without legislation and

1238
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:37,219
regulation of some kind so I think this

1239
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:40,249
is it but happy to talk afterward

1240
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:43,460
especially after my my pupils adjust to

1241
00:51:40,249 --> 00:51:46,609
normal light again thanks guys

1242
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,610
[Applause]
