3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,010
everyone doing good all right it's been

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,040
2 hours since we had a self

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,809
congratulatory clap so let's give it up

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,880
again for hope for Chelsea Manning for a

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,520
manual for Kyle for the volunteers for

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,340
the speaker committee for the AV guys

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,259
for all of you for being here and making

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,750
hope what it is it's pretty amazing yeah

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,759
anyhow I'm gonna tell you guys a bit of

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,530
a story today if I can get the mic down

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,500
to a normal human height okay I want to

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,840
tell a story and like all stories you

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,399
need characters and we're gonna explore

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,270
some rather interesting characters

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,190
including the president and in order to

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,170
do that what you need to do is sort of

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,820
look at them intellectually look at

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,030
their philosophies and look at their

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,890
actions and we're going to tell a rather

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,020
fascinating story about a cyber squadra

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,629
that we identified through monitoring

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,470
the DNS as it relates to Trump related

25
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,420
domain names and in order to sort of

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,200
tell a story you also have to set a

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,420
stage and so I think we should get on

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,220
with it because we have a lot of we got

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,369
a lot of ground to cover here so let's

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:27,119
go so cybersquatting on the Trump

31
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:30,750
campaign let's start off in Texas 1948

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,250
it's hot it's a congressional campaign

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,119
we know about this particular

34
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,040
congressional campaign and how irritated

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,299
people were not just because they were

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,470
in Texas but we know about this

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,149
particular congressional campaign

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,579
because of Hunter S Thompson he wrote

39
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,600
fear and loathing on the campaign trail

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,899
in 1972 but it was about LBJ's campaign

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,369
in 1948 and he was up against this guy

42
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,259
his name was W Leo Daniels and LBJ was a

43
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,409
pretty aggressive campaigner but he was

44
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:09,119
up on the ropes and he came up with this

45
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,280
very unique idea to discredit his

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,130
opponent and to slander him to bring him

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,780
down a couple of notches

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,090
and I do have to say my five-year-old is

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,390
in the room so sweetie you might want to

50
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,170
hold Sasha's ears for a second but this

51
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,160
particular idea that LBJ had his

52
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,859
campaign manager balked at it and

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,450
respond to tell BJ like this Christ we

54
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,460
can't get away with calling that guy a

55
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:40,570
pig nobody's gonna believe a

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,570
thing like that but they did

57
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,040
that's Peppa Pig Sasha and LBJ's

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,350
response to his campaign manager was

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,590
well let's make this son of a bitch deny

60
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,590
it and that brings us to chapter 1

61
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,530
misinformation so we're gonna go into

62
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,269
the little background here so

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,830
misinformation generally it's false

64
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,470
inaccurate information that's intended

65
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,570
to deceive it's not a new concept by any

66
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,430
means it's basically as old as human

67
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,190
conflict itself that something some zoo

68
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,640
actually wrote about the department

69
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,750
offense defines misinformation as

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,459
measures designed to mislead or

71
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,280
manipulate distort falsify evidence

72
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:25,090
induce the enemy to react in a manner

73
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,590
prejudicial to the enemy's interests and

74
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,660
widespread information as we've all come

75
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,030
to realize is very very difficult to

76
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,670
counter and that's because it's

77
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,500
amplified by things like news outlets

78
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,780
and amplified by things like social

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,600
media as we saw with the whole Cambridge

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:45,680
analytic Aafia Facebook Fiasco that's

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,970
been unraveling and moving on we're

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
gonna talk about Trump and

83
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,950
misinformation but only a couple choice

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
selections of Trump and misinformation

85
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,660
because we could spend the entire

86
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,240
weekend talking about the 6.5 lies per

87
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,720
day that the president tells so let's go

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,730
into a couple choice bits here he's been

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,000
very good at this and this is something

90
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,369
that he's been doing for decades from

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,900
the art of the deal he wrote one thing

92
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,610
I've learned about the press is that

93
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,709
they're always hungry for a good story

94
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,780
in the more sensational the better I

95
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,120
play to people's fantasies people may

96
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,250
not always think big themselves but they

97
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,740
can still get very excited by those who

98
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,630
do that's why a little hyperbole never

99
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,400
hurts

100
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,540
people want to believe that something is

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,219
the biggest and the greatest and the

102
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,330
most spectacular I call it truthful

103
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,790
hyperbole great it's an innocent form of

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:42,969
exaggeration and a very effective form

105
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:45,970
of promotion now back in the 90s when

106
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,610
Trump and Ivana were together he had a

107
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,430
public relations employee by the name of

108
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,690
John Miller sometimes system perhaps it

109
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,060
was another employee by the name of John

110
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,460
Baron and and he would often call

111
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,350
reporters as Trump's PR representative

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,549
from his Manhattan office and this John

113
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,470
Miller guy knew a whole hell of a lot

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,870
about Trump in his personal life and he

115
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,500
was unusually helpful and very very

116
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,330
boastful of Trump and his activities

117
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,310
then later on at a deposition in 1990

118
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,880
Trump actually admitted that sometimes

119
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,560
he used those names as a pseudonym so

120
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,630
let's listen to John Miller

121
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,190
quote-unquote John Miller attack Ivana

122
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,980
after she did a Barbara Walters

123
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,680
interview when they were breaking up and

124
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,200
said that she would never get back to

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,560
with Donald Trump again and you guys

126
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,219
tell me if this is Trump I don't think

127
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,220
we have in the audio

128
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:10,180
that's off the record yeah that was John

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:27,039
Miller everybody so another little bit

130
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:30,400
from John Miller I made do you think

131
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,349
that was Donald Trump yeah I think so I

132
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
mean the one thing that we can take away

133
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,699
from this is that you know he's always

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,199
been this sort of erratic and disjointed

135
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,659
and in his speech I mean this is from

136
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,340
decades ago so at least we know this

137
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,080
isn't sort of early stage on saw

138
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,520
Alzheimer's that we're dealing with from

139
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,590
the president this has just always been

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,969
his fragile mental state again when you

141
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,840
think back to what he said in the art of

142
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:57,340
the deal he plays to people's fantasies

143
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,229
recall back right after the inauguration

144
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,060
there was this nonsense about alleged

145
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,378
voter fraud because he didn't win the

146
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,090
popular vote people were making a big

147
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:07,150
deal of that and perhaps he might have

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,130
known that his presidency was a little

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,049
bit more fragile than I think really the

150
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,759
entire public knew at the time perhaps

151
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,530
he had an inside track into some of that

152
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,539
knowledge so he created this

153
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,679
presidential Advisory Commission on

154
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:22,568
electric election integrity Kris Kobach

155
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,490
was appointed to this and to investigate

156
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,259
this massive voter fraud that he had

157
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,840
publicly alleged happened that cost him

158
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,880
the popular vote well it was completely

159
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,440
debunked the Commission disbanded very

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,360
quietly and nobody ever heard about it

161
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,009
again and remember this crazy scene look

162
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,020
at all this paper from my lawyers you

163
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,520
know I've divested myself of my

164
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,930
corporate interest I'm no longer

165
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,609
associated with a Trump campaign I'm the

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,500
Trump Organization I'm the President of

167
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,029
the United States now they constantly

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,229
pointed to the paperwork they had a

169
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,490
bunch of staffers in the room pointing

170
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,289
applauding but nobody could ever really

171
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,729
take a look at any of those papers I

172
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,919
mean it could have been comic books in

173
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:04,330
there I mean who knows you just don't

174
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,680
know now to step back to the campaign

175
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,568
itself and talk about some

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,750
misinformation and misdirection with

177
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,150
regard to the DNC hack let's think back

178
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,060
to this so there was a false mouthpiece

179
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,640
was created that the Russians created

180
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,680
they created the persona of DC leaks and

181
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,979
they registered the domain name DC leaks

182
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,080
comm and when they did this they did

183
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,790
this because they knew if they released

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,370
the information that they had that had

185
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,350
exfiltrated from the DNC it would be

186
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,200
seen as more credible coming from an

187
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,540
independent third party what independent

188
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,120
third party did they associate they

189
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,549
associated us American hacktivists

190
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,260
American hackers and in one sense I

191
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,959
guess we can be proud because the

192
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,420
Russians perceive us as objective but

193
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,900
they used us to give them a veneer of

194
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,099
respectability and objectivity not

195
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,620
something we should be happy about

196
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,110
and after the DNC announced that this

197
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,390
was actually Russian actors that were

198
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,550
involved in a DNC hack that was when

199
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,640
they created a new persona of gusoff ur

200
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,880
2.0 masquerading around as a Romanian

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,160
hacker and at the same time that they

202
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,610
created that gusoff ur generated a blog

203
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,939
post entitled yeah very directly DNC's

204
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,250
Herbers hacked by a lone hacker not the

205
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,410
Russians and gusoff ur that when he when

206
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,110
he posted this he used these tags and

207
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,480
keywords that would attract conspiracy

208
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,440
theorists and the alt-right things like

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,440
the Illuminati in deep state what we

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,690
also learned fairly recently too was

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,060
that another source of misdirection and

212
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,670
obfuscation happened with crypto

213
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,280
currencies and we know this from the

214
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,770
penultimate Muller indictment of 12

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,900
Russian nationals that was filed in

216
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,810
federal court just last week and in

217
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,150
particular at I believe it's page 21

218
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,250
count 10 of this indictment they

219
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,870
mentioned that there was Bitcoin mining

220
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,910
happening and a Bitcoin mining operation

221
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,650
also funded through the same Bitcoin

222
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,410
address the purchase of servers and

223
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,160
domains used in the GRU spearfishing

224
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,980
operations including these type o

225
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,270
squatting domains accounts - google.com

226
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,480
and account - google.com with three o's

227
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,610
and they also used a romanian registrar

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,660
to register DC leaks but that's not

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,040
mentioned here so going on I want to

230
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,770
spend a little bit

231
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,599
trying to explain to you why we started

232
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,460
tracking things relating to the Trump

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,620
campaign we do some work with insurance

234
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,630
companies at my law firm and we were

235
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,300
presenting at the National Association

236
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,600
of mutual insurance companies in Chicago

237
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,030
just last I'm sorry last year three

238
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,040
March 2017 the issue that we were

239
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,439
addressing was is there enough data to

240
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,150
underwrite cyber liability insurance and

241
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,470
we were making the point that there's a

242
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,949
lot of data out there you just have to

243
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,140
know where to pluck it and so we needed

244
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,270
an example of an organization that was

245
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,610
facing a lot of dns-based InfoSec

246
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,390
threats but was completely asleep at the

247
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,180
switch so we use the Trump Organization

248
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,640
and what I'll show you now are some

249
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,650
actual registered permutations of Trump

250
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,260
com that nobody really seems to be

251
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,329
paying attention to and these existed

252
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,370
most of them existed at the time of our

253
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,330
presentation in 2017 when we first

254
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,400
started looking at Trump's DNS records

255
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,530
so here's a couple of them if you want

256
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,620
to scroll through here I mean just about

257
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:35,350
every single permutation and if you take

258
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,020
a look at the geographical locations of

259
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,660
these domains they're all over the place

260
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,829
but don't don't worry there's more

261
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,829
there's a few more over here

262
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,040
I mean seriously there's just a lot of

263
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,630
these and actually we step back for a

264
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,939
second please don't get excited about

265
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,770
these these are just common spearfishing

266
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,540
words that are attached to domains that

267
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,640
we were tracking as well but this is by

268
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,530
no means an indication that that's the

269
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,090
entire universe of domains that relate

270
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,130
to the Trump Organization and here's a

271
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,540
couple of my favorites even WW Trump com

272
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,970
was registered and nobody seemed to be

273
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,500
paying attention to it some of the data

274
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,510
below that is just based off a little

275
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,170
script that I wrote because we do a lot

276
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,250
of Whois lookups on a daily basis so I

277
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,110
combined a little bash script with some

278
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,370
geo IP lookups and then piped it out to

279
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,780
Cal say because that's fun but if you

280
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,460
take a look at this Chinese registrar

281
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,660
remember this creation date and remember

282
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,130
this domain name because we're going to

283
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,439
use it as place marker it is August 17th

284
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,930
2015 and we're going to get back to it

285
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,810
so you combine that with lazy

286
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:45,400
enforcement practices when it comes to

287
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,930
policing the DNS the last UDR PUD RP

288
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,510
stands for uniform domain name

289
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,010
resolution policy the last you DRP

290
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,200
filing which is a little mini

291
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,240
arbitration that happens either in the

292
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,740
United States in Minnesota with the

293
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,930
National arbitration forum they go by

294
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,490
the forum now or in Geneva with the

295
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,279
World Intellectual Property Organization

296
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,230
and this is how people reclaim domains

297
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,000
organizations reclaim domains from cyber

298
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,040
squatters if you have rights to your

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,770
name you would file a you DRP complaint

300
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,770
with the last one we saw filed with naff

301
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:18,460
was in 2011 and it related to Trump Inc

302
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,410
us and if you look at why pose filings

303
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,270
the last filing we saw of the Trump

304
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,319
Organization reclaiming a domain name

305
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:29,020
was in 2016 and it was a direct match of

306
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,020
a trademark Trump spa so they were

307
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,470
looking to enforce their trademarks and

308
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,720
in fact the the complaint in here DT TM

309
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,760
operations I would presume stands for

310
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,490
Donald Trump trademark operations which

311
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,260
is the holder of the trademarks they

312
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,540
probably weren't even actually looking

313
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,830
at the DNS for these particular types of

314
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,740
squatters because what I can't

315
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,089
instituted after the 2012 gTLD program

316
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,470
was something called the trademark

317
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,900
Clearing House so if you have a

318
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,310
trademark and you use it in commerce you

319
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,140
can submit the string of that trademark

320
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,030
to the trademark Clearing House somebody

321
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,030
registers a domain name you'll get a

322
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:06,189
notification that it exists and so that

323
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,319
to me signals that they were probably

324
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,720
just getting indications from the

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,850
trademark Clearing House operated

326
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,920
through I can when they found this

327
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,540
particular domain but again that's the

328
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,270
last filing we were able to uncover and

329
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,790
now it's over two years ago was just

330
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,740
about two years ago so we decided this

331
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,650
was pretty much a dumpster fire worth

332
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,970
tracking so what we have developed

333
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:33,040
internally inside our law firm is and

334
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,600
some DNS monitoring tools that we coded

335
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,339
ourselves that give us really

336
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,820
interesting insight and visibility into

337
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:42,459
the DNS we get about 400 million records

338
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,290
daily and develop some very unique ways

339
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,619
of searching for threats and cyber

340
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,150
squatters and permutations and so since

341
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,459
we've decided this was a dumpster fire

342
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,370
worth tracking we actually did and we

343
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,229
began tracking all 65,000 Plus Dome

344
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,110
that contain the string Trump in them

345
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,220
and here's just some of the data kind of

346
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,210
scroll through it this is the beginning

347
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,860
of our dataset here more you get down

348
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,480
towards the bottom of it and we just

349
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,540
started collecting a lot of DNS related

350
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,339
information there and not surprisingly

351
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:19,660
we found some curiosities like this one

352
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:22,270
Trump club Roo does anybody want to

353
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,370
hazard a guess what Trump club Roo could

354
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:29,410
be there's got to be brave soul here who

355
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:31,930
has some some idea porn site porn site

356
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,870
this guy is somewhat close what could it

357
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:40,890
be what could the Trump Club Ruby if not

358
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,890
a Russian escort service there you go

359
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:54,190
yeah moving on the real president Donald

360
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:55,650
Trump anybody hazard a guess you guys

361
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,709
are a lot smarter than you look

362
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,720
porn straight up porn straight up horn

363
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,609
absolutely however it really depends on

364
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,320
how you characterize it this could just

365
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,820
be pictures of friendly elderly

366
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:13,290
gentlemen kind of like the President

367
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:16,540
himself the real Trump Pete a.com

368
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,640
anybody guess anybody guess okay all

369
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,920
right well this one's pretty obvious

370
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,560
it's a Russian site with an animated P

371
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,029
tape and if you translate the the

372
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,380
actually the Russian there and it stands

373
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,779
for which is why you have the Russian

374
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,610
Eagles in the back the official Russian

375
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:35,980
Ministry of indecency is what it is yes

376
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,830
that's the official site the real Trumpy

377
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,360
tape calm but getting back to the heart

378
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,970
of the matter here we also found some

379
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,290
interesting registration anomalies to

380
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,230
find anomalies you have to find the

381
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,150
ordinary registration pattern so once

382
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,830
you have amassed all this data you can

383
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,360
begin to filter and do some pattern

384
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,790
recognition some pattern matching and

385
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,950
this is what Trump's portfolio of

386
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,420
domains generally looks like they've got

387
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,070
this associate with the Whois data

388
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,449
general counsel general counsel at Trump

389
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:07,900
were calm so once we collect the data on

390
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:11,260
over 65,000 of these we saw another

391
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,600
pattern showing up these the Trump

392
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,910
Organization domain transfers transfers

393
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,129
at Trump were calm well that's sort of

394
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,500
piqued our interest and what we have

395
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,080
here frankly is a little bit more

396
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,480
laziness because after the domains were

397
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,429
transferred nobody ever bothered to go

398
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,010
back into the Whois registration data

399
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,480
and conform it to their usual pattern

400
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,820
because nobody would have ever been able

401
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,080
to find these domains otherwise so they

402
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,350
didn't do that they missed that last

403
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,139
step and we began to kind of have our

404
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,820
interest piqued so he looked out at the

405
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,110
historical Whois records for some of

406
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,629
these domains and we found some stuff

407
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,659
that jumped out to us so for instance

408
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,210
Donald J Trump 16 com was registered by

409
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,520
God by the name of Justin Tribble and he

410
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,650
was associated with the Sedona holistic

411
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,210
and natural therapy foundation for

412
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,910
greater awareness kind of odd strain so

413
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,580
then we looked at Donald John Trump 2016

414
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,290
dot-com same guy Justin Tribble Sedona

415
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,040
holistic natural therapy foundation for

416
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:15,010
greater awareness and we looked at

417
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,590
Donald Trump real twitter.com again same

418
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,410
guy and we looked at Donald Trump

419
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:23,770
twitter.com Donald J Trump con Donald

420
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:26,080
Trump's official facebook.com triple

421
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:32,230
triple triple that's all it was triple

422
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:34,570
trouble so who is Justin triple and

423
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,580
that's where we go into chapter a new

424
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,139
chapter here chapter three The Curious

425
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:45,340
Case of Justin triple this is Justin

426
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,530
Tribble he claims on LinkedIn that he's

427
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:52,629
a professional chef a master chef in all

428
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:54,639
lowercase in st. Paul Minnesota and this

429
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,640
is his spiritual awareness center that

430
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,010
he runs in Sedona which is kind of like

431
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,870
this weird you know place on the planet

432
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,820
Earth that has vortices coming in - it's

433
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,219
supposed to have psychic healing powers

434
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,070
and you know not in other things and and

435
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,510
not really sure about it but anyone some

436
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,280
interesting things jumped out here you

437
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,679
know where dreams come true who find the

438
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:19,639
essence of Tribble

439
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,799
we certainly are and it sounds to me a

440
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:23,719
lot like Mara Lago in some sense right

441
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,759
we only let certain people and this is

442
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,249
an exclusive club I'm not in the

443
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,350
business of just letting anyone and you

444
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:32,450
have to be spiritually ready to be here

445
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,889
I have literally not left the compound

446
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,769
in seven years I haven't set foot

447
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:39,590
anywhere else I don't know how he's a

448
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:41,509
master chef in Minnesota but yeah what

449
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,559
this indicates is this guy it really is

450
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:47,330
his whole life as this Hall of Mirrors

451
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,918
and then here's this pricing list he can

452
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,480
get a one-on-one massage for three

453
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,350
hundred thirty-five dollars from Tribble

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,269
if anyone's interested and here at his

455
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,980
retreat they're looking for people who

456
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,210
are ready for the next step if you want

457
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,860
to waste time in your little three

458
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,629
dimensional plane of existence go ahead

459
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,119
but you won't be allowed in here I

460
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:07,428
should only at a four dimensional plane

461
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,470
of existence anyways in time a dimension

462
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,100
maybe that doesn't apply to Justin

463
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,019
Tribble so let's go in a little deeper

464
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,019
here things got a little strange because

465
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:20,690
Russia today interviewed Tribble in 2012

466
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:22,519
and they flagged him in the television

467
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,879
show as a blogger as an activist

468
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,799
somebody with some credibility and he

469
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:30,619
had this interview that pertained to the

470
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:34,908
river libertarian candidate Ron Paul so

471
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:37,730
we get some audio on this could say that

472
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:40,999
they're against the Constitution or that

473
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,369
they're against limited government for

474
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:45,679
that they're against defending the

475
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:48,009
homeland or defending our borders and

476
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,049
since Ron Paul supports all those things

477
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,970
it just baffles me that he doesn't

478
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,740
receive more support but I think it's

479
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,230
because people just aren't informed they

480
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,119
just don't know they haven't really

481
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:03,169
looked at him they haven't studied him

482
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:06,889
they have no idea well I'm also baffled

483
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:09,649
Justin and here's another interesting

484
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:11,269
thing is that triple and you look at him

485
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,168
in a social media post he really seems

486
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,369
to side with Russia on a lot of issues

487
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:18,289
let's take a look at some of his posts

488
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,749
when this guy is doing more to keep the

489
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,658
us out of war than this guy it's

490
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:25,519
officially time to reevaluate another

491
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,980
one another this is recent another

492
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,440
chemical attack falsely blamed on Assad

493
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:35,059
the American people wake the up all

494
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,460
right some more very recent 13 days ago

495
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,470
I can't believe Trump didn't back up our

496
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,919
intelligence agencies what possible

497
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:46,580
reason could he have for doubting them

498
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,040
okay and then here's one a Twitter post

499
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,470
from him right after Trump had let in

500
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,899
the Russian delegation from their

501
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,510
embassy into the Oval Office and then

502
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,720
had disclosed classified information to

503
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,790
them of the higher than top-secret level

504
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,260
I believe it was TSS CI and Trump and

505
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,399
Tribble had dents did Trump shared in

506
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,910
front with the Russians that would help

507
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,520
prevent at erste he probably saved lives

508
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,960
okay why not but then a little more

509
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,840
troubling is that he seems to have a lot

510
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,890
of anti-semitic inclinations let's take

511
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,220
a look at this this will be slightly

512
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:23,299
offensive so here we are just in Tribble

513
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:26,450
December 9th 2017 and this is a quote

514
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,520
that he's quoting the Jews were 2bic to

515
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,260
picked it by Hitler as the greedy

516
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,299
bankers and as the greedy bankers in

517
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,210
capitalist class and then his comment is

518
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:37,490
maybe because that's what they are with

519
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,690
a little laughing smiley next to it and

520
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,880
then underneath that I don't think

521
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,799
Hitler was really wrong in his views he

522
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,370
fought in World War one he saw what the

523
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,950
Jews did to Germany I mean terrible so I

524
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,020
mean this gave me a lot less reluctance

525
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,370
to call this guy out when you're an

526
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,460
anti-semitic son of a bitch like that

527
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,320
it's it's fair game so it gets a little

528
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,880
we want to have the audio up to four

529
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,280
something coming up this gets a little

530
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,720
stranger here his Facebook page he's got

531
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,240
all of his favorite celebrities over

532
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:14,590
there and he's also got this guy this is

533
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,380
your moment the promise is in new yeah

534
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:20,870
Joel Osteen okay a lot of people here

535
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,100
may not know who Joel Osteen is but

536
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:26,689
there he is we do have a lot of people

537
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,549
come here internationally so they may

538
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,020
not be very familiar with this

539
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,639
bible-banging and Jesus preaching but

540
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,230
here's a 30-second version he's an

541
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,700
American television list 20 million

542
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,290
monthly viewers found in a hundred

543
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,610
countries we can listen to him right now

544
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,250
if we wanted to on satellite radio

545
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,899
because Syria's broadcast him 24/7

546
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,500
he went to Oral Roberts and affinity

547
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,420
school never got a degree and became a

548
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,180
very very well-known preacher in Texas

549
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,460
purchased the Compaq Center which was

550
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,530
the home of the NBA's Houston Rockets

551
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,600
Rockets hidden he has a very interesting

552
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,730
take on theology which is this

553
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,090
prosperity gospel or prosperity theology

554
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,490
which basically boils down to Jesus

555
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,260
Christ wants you to be rich he loves you

556
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,280
if you're rich and if you're rich it's

557
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,310
probably because you were a good

558
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,580
Christian so that yes material gain is

559
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,270
the reward for all pious Christians his

560
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,100
net worth

561
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,900
he used must be very pious because he's

562
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,480
worth between 40 million and 60 million

563
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,730
dollars and he lives in a 17,000 square

564
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,980
foot mansion worth about ten point five

565
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,610
million dollars but something weird

566
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:33,020
happened in 2013 he announced that he

567
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,370
was leaving the Christian faith and this

568
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:39,470
renunciation of the Christian faith was

569
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:42,419
reported worldwide he basically said

570
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,490
many people want more answers and are

571
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,680
asking why I did this I have one simple

572
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,780
response I have come to realize my

573
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,000
followers have begun to deify me and

574
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,680
listen to me and not God this among

575
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,880
other reasons led me down a path of

576
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,870
awakening however this was literally

577
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,880
fake news triple register Joel Osteen

578
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,120
ministries calm and created this

579
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,150
particularly where the announcement to

580
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,300
garner the attention of Joel Osteen in

581
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,550
an interview Tribble explained that he

582
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,110
had issues with Osteen's prosperity

583
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,060
gospel and he wanted to get the

584
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,850
attention of this man who was otherwise

585
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:25,850
inaccessible to him so let's listen to

586
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,850
tribbles own words we can get the audio

587
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,639
I did not want it necessarily to get to

588
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,710
this level and now that it is I want a

589
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,060
message to get through to this guy hung

590
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:41,850
down appreciate know so there you have

591
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,770
it that's the whole reasoning there so

592
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:49,678
here's the trouble with trouble

593
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:51,658
he needs to seek attention and and he

594
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,220
gets he becomes infatuated it appears

595
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,899
they becomes infatuated with these

596
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,970
celebrity figures and performs these

597
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,439
hoaxes to get their attention and these

598
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,120
are the domains that he registered that

599
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,570
we were able to identify with respect to

600
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,520
Donald Trump this list right here now

601
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,350
it's possible that he did this is some

602
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,620
kind of altruistic gesture of

603
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,299
pre-emptive domain registration goodwill

604
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,279
you know because he liked the guy and he

605
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,168
was a fan of him and you know nothing

606
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,010
says I love you more than a pre-emptive

607
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:21,750
domain name registration right Christmas

608
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,490
Day you realize thank you so much honey

609
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,289
all I ever really wanted was common

610
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,659
misspellings of my primary domain name

611
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:29,750
this is great this is the best Christmas

612
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:33,539
ever

613
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,070
highly unlikely unfortunately it seems

614
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,480
obvious to us and hopefully to you that

615
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:40,289
this guy was planning a hoax but at the

616
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,230
end of 2015 the scheme was identified

617
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:45,029
and it was halted and we know that

618
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,950
tribble ultimately transferred these

619
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,870
without any form of legal process there

620
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,870
were no UDR piece filed there was no

621
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,820
lawsuit filed he did this willingly he

622
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:57,059
was very likely contacted by the Trump

623
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,000
Organization which meant that they were

624
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:03,389
watching this and this raises some kind

625
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,270
of serious questions I think how did

626
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,850
they figure this out how did the Trump

627
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,500
campaign catch this because these

628
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,879
registrations were quite literally a

629
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,450
needle in a haystack the signal-to-noise

630
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:19,140
ratio was really tricky it was not

631
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,840
really in their favor at the time of

632
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,360
2015 we think there were probably around

633
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,270
30,000 domain name registrations so it

634
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,399
would have been really hard to find this

635
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:31,770
and we know based on those domains that

636
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,779
we showed you earlier especially WWE

637
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,270
Trump comm which was registered in

638
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:38,970
August of 2015 that the Trump

639
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,340
Organization was not really policing the

640
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:45,390
domain name space of that system at that

641
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,668
point because nobody was paying

642
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,390
attention to things like this this kind

643
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:55,230
of nonsense right now this domain was

644
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,120
registered exactly two weeks before WWE

645
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,680
Trump calm was registered two weeks

646
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,530
before

647
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,380
tribbles domains were all registered so

648
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,870
when they were scouring the DNS for

649
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,250
registrations that troubled them they

650
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:14,250
found these triple domains and ignored

651
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:18,330
wwm comm and other blatant InfoSec

652
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:21,090
threats that were DNS based and remember

653
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,590
that we saw that the only enforcement

654
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,879
that you know that the Trump

655
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,439
Organization was engaging in was to

656
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,930
protect its trademarks and for

657
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,520
ridiculous things like Trump's PAH so

658
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,260
they weren't really paying attention to

659
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,150
this it must have been a third party

660
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,520
working specifically for the campaign

661
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:37,170
that did this

662
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:41,370
we don't however see any of the

663
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:43,110
hallmarks of the usual organizations or

664
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,719
corporate entities that police the DNS

665
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,600
you know the the configuration of Whois

666
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,820
data certain domains being transferred

667
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,709
over to specialized corporate

668
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,250
registrar's we don't see any of those

669
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,780
hallmarks whatsoever and remember this

670
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,750
all happened at the end of 2015

671
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,280
Trump wasn't really a very serious

672
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,960
candidate back then I know some people

673
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,820
did take him extremely seriously but it

674
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,530
wasn't until well into 2016 that he

675
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,320
became extraordinarily serious and

676
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,700
dangerous but somebody saw this somebody

677
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,220
competence saw it research did

678
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,770
identified it reported it and put a halt

679
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,600
to what could have been a damaging hoax

680
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,330
in order to get the attention of

681
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,870
somebody with whom Tribble appeared to

682
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:30,540
be infatuated and remember the the only

683
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,959
real digital competence that we saw was

684
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,510
detailed in the Muller indictment but

685
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,840
yeah I'm not one to cast aspersions far

686
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:43,970
be it for me to make any insinuation as

687
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,970
to who was possibly helping him and

688
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:54,100
but anyhow all jokes being aside if this

689
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,110
was not some kind of foreign assistance

690
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,850
and this you know unlike the election

691
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,679
wasn't one with the help of foreign

692
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,080
assistance this does say something

693
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,870
rather interesting about Trump and his

694
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,159
people and their capabilities so what

695
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,010
are some deductions that we can make

696
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,520
here well Trump does seem to be pretty

697
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,710
incompetent at things like governing

698
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,050
he's really really competent when it

699
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,210
comes to the manipulation of information

700
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,159
because he's had over 40 years of

701
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,630
experience doing this we saw him doing

702
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,550
this in the 80s he saw I'm doing it in

703
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,190
90s you listened to him doing it through

704
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:31,149
the voice of John Miller and John Barron

705
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,390
today and he has people around him that

706
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:38,110
are similarly immune to the truth and

707
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:39,610
willing to bend veracity for their own

708
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,290
purposes to sort of make up their own

709
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,649
falsehoods make up their own version of

710
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:48,670
the world so that it becomes something

711
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,320
that suits them and another takeaway

712
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,960
here is that there is a very big

713
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,760
difference in skill sets attention and

714
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,400
competency between the Trump

715
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,129
Organization and the Trump campaign

716
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,810
because we still see very little

717
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,990
enforcement activity when it comes to

718
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,399
the DNS and the Trump Organization it's

719
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,320
almost as if they've they've thrown

720
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,210
their hands up and with an organization

721
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,460
as large as the Trump Organization and

722
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,080
as public sometimes that's what people

723
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,890
do and they just monitor for threats but

724
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,500
we don't really even see those hallmarks

725
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,900
but they're all very very good the Trump

726
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,880
campaign staff is extremely good when it

727
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,370
comes to information control and

728
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,740
effective misinformation they may get

729
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:32,770
called out for their misinformation but

730
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:35,740
then that has become the basically the

731
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,510
24-hour job of our news organizations is

732
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,040
to constantly call out the lies and the

733
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:43,360
falsehoods all of this misinformation

734
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,909
and as we all know from our day jobs it

735
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,810
takes a very competent attacker to make

736
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:52,660
a skilled defender so the point being

737
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:55,570
here is that we need to be vigilant

738
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,760
we need to presume I'm sorry that it's

739
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,220
wrong to presume that there is no

740
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,100
method to the madness that we see on a

741
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,680
daily basis it's exhausting but we have

742
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,560
to pay attention because we're warned by

743
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,200
Orwell that these uncorrect lives will

744
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,360
be passed into history and become truth

745
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,100
and that's a very dangerous situation I

746
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,100
think that's what we're facing right now

747
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,540
it's a little epilogue to the story we

748
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,190
are through our law firm we offer DNS

749
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,320
monitoring policing services but that's

750
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,500
not the point of this we're also putting

751
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,960
our technology that we developed for

752
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,280
what we perceived to be we're putting it

753
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,260
to work for what we perceive to be the

754
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,430
public good and we're doing some

755
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,100
interesting things we're able to

756
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,900
identify and report on all of the anti

757
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,419
Comey domains that were registered by

758
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,790
the GOP and our good friends over advise

759
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,320
motherboard ran an excellent story about

760
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,820
this that was kind of fun and then we

761
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,720
realized we had some interesting ideas

762
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,399
and well let me take one step back yes

763
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,470
of course we are continuing to monitor

764
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,060
all Trump domains on a daily basis all

765
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,510
new registrations we're watching

766
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,730
everything

767
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,940
we're carefully monitoring this space

768
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,890
and something that came out of doing off

769
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,770
the hook every week with Emmanuel and

770
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:19,210
Kyle and Firefly and Voltaire as we all

771
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,210
get together afterwards we go out to

772
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:24,520
dinner and we talk and during one of

773
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,620
those conversations at dinner Emmanuel

774
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,990
and I were discussing well you developed

775
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,989
this really interesting tool and you've

776
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:35,920
detected these Komi domains perhaps we

777
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,600
could begin to monitor the DNS for

778
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,100
misinformation campaigns and smear

779
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,260
campaigns as they relate to the midterm

780
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,330
elections so we started doing that and

781
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,490
we actually have a server entirely

782
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,500
dedicated to monitoring the DNS for

783
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,630
smear campaigns misinformation campaigns

784
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,100
attacks against candidates and we

785
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,980
started this just a couple of weeks ago

786
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,290
and it's kind of mind-blowing what we've

787
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,390
been finding already we've already made

788
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,909
literally hundreds of significant

789
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,010
findings we don't necessarily have a lot

790
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,170
of time to go into those findings that I

791
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,580
have a feeling that you will be hearing

792
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,210
about them very shortly

793
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,319
perhaps Monday and so keep your eyes

794
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,130
peeled guys because

795
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,230
some good stuff is coming and that's it

796
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,030
for me so that's the story of the

797
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,010
cybersquad oh that scared Trump I'm Alex

798
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,300
are Bellis and I'm here for questions if

799
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,300
you have any thank you all for listening

800
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,770
any questions it's hard to see with the

801
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,990
lights here there's one guy okay one

802
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,270
unshot so how are you hi how are you

803
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:45,158
good alright alright well I have to say

804
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,989
it was a very good presentation very

805
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:51,399
specific lot of detail thank you

806
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:54,129
appreciate that I think illustrates the

807
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,138
that there is certain skills Trump may

808
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,490
ostensibly be said to have areas of

809
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,260
oversight he's pretty good at you might

810
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,839
even say social or info hacking it's

811
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,740
kind of impressive quite frankly but I

812
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,240
just I wanted to ask do you view it as

813
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,520
kind of coincidental or kind of

814
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,200
interesting that the mainstream media in

815
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,200
the u.s. which is not immune from

816
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,509
political influences I have to point out

817
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,250
and the so-called deep state we call

818
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,829
them these euphemisms kind of Orwellian

819
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,200
euphemisms like intelligence community

820
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:25,150
and what does that mean right but anyway

821
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,160
and then you have kind of more

822
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,869
independent-minded kind of a

823
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,690
free-spirited hackers like ourselves and

824
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,819
that it do you have any comment maybe on

825
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,770
kind of the interesting optics of having

826
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:37,720
all those kind of line up kind of on the

827
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,670
same page and kind of in the Trump

828
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,709
overall situation with respect to Russia

829
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,930
which everyone knows is intervening and

830
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,480
being a bad actor but I'm interested to

831
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,740
hear sure so there is the question if I

832
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,750
understand it correctly near the the

833
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,189
optics of seeing this and not having the

834
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,750
mainstream media report on it things

835
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,579
like that is that the question well well

836
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,980
no kind of just having the general theme

837
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:58,480
of it that that there may be some you

838
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,010
know foreign help at which really is

839
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,960
frankly indisputable it kind of it

840
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,150
almost seems if it forgive me almost a

841
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,680
bit redundant being the mainstream media

842
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,420
or so-called where well II an

843
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,368
intelligence community right those guys

844
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,690
which being a patriot I happen to think

845
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:12,280
in principle are very important to have

846
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,260
but you know kind of having an old

847
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,630
lineup but to be on the same page it's

848
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,819
seemed almost excessive say like yes

849
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,770
yeah I agree and you know there's this

850
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:23,079
issue I think you do bring up a good

851
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,700
point to is there was some kind of

852
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,680
strange issue with alpha bank in the

853
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,029
Trump campaign and weird DNS queries

854
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,348
going back and forth and nobody's ever

855
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,500
really figured out what the hell was

856
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:36,430
going on there and that's sort of a dud

857
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,440
of a story too so it was a big story but

858
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,270
it never really went anywhere nobody was

859
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,250
a burr ever able really to draw any

860
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,980
solid conclusions from these kind of

861
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,390
weird interact

862
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,850
tons of various servers between alpha

863
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,290
bank and the Trump Organization and so

864
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,540
to an extent I think the mainstream

865
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,190
media could get tired out of that they

866
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,540
don't necessarily like to focus on the

867
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,070
technical components of it but I think

868
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,800
they're getting better at it and I think

869
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,359
that's partly to our credit because it

870
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,070
means we're doing a good job of talking

871
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,930
to them and educating them and I think

872
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,090
we have to continue to do that job

873
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,640
because all of this is going to continue

874
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:10,190
to play an increasingly large part in

875
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,440
misinformation campaigns in election

876
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,410
campaigns and and you know almost ever

877
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,460
any major story or any major world event

878
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:22,339
is going to involve information security

879
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:24,380
another question yeah um one of the

880
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,880
things that I wanted to raise is that

881
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,240
there's actually a very large community

882
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,520
of folks that work on issues like this

883
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,459
around ICANN and around the community

884
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,990
that manages the the global DNS and so

885
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,609
don't feel like you're the only person

886
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,859
out there there's literally hundreds of

887
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:43,130
companies that are monitoring this kind

888
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:44,540
of information and if you'd like to

889
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,090
participate I'm more than happy to hook

890
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,800
people up but I think that you've

891
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,890
stumbled on something that we've been

892
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,720
working on for almost 20 years there are

893
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,850
crazy people out on the internet and

894
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,580
they like to register domain names

895
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,650
because they're cheap and do funky stuff

896
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,560
with them and we chased this stuff down

897
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:06,890
all the time when law enforcement is

898
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,779
going after a botnet or when somebody's

899
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,700
trying to figure out who is stealing

900
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,830
their domain because they typos squatted

901
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,589
it it's it happens all the time and it's

902
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,799
terrible process terrible legal process

903
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:20,720
that I can is set up but it is the

904
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,490
process that we have and if you want to

905
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,339
participate and change that process you

906
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,290
can that space is open to participate in

907
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,720
and the ICANN meetings are free to

908
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,140
attend although they are all over the

909
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,149
world and so my question for you is

910
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,460
what's your next one what is the thing

911
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,740
you you identified something that and

912
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,140
how many of these things are there

913
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,250
you're monitoring all of the DNS now

914
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,750
right how many are there can you tell us

915
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,900
how many what how many of their

916
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:53,660
instances of these typo squatting kinds

917
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,190
of things happen for instance um how

918
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,319
often does this happen with hurricane

919
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,810
names

920
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,020
just last year this happened a number of

921
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,190
times there were faults yeah I think I

922
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,540
get the question I think you're saying

923
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,490
so yet this happens all the time

924
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,900
absolutely and this is what we do it's

925
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,569
what other people do we track these

926
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,340
things we monitor them you know you and

927
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,600
I were speaking about this yesterday as

928
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,590
well

929
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,450
so look there's the Internet's a big

930
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,970
place the world is a big place weird

931
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:24,129
things happen we shouldn't just be

932
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,990
throwing our hands up and saying oh well

933
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,730
there's crazy people out here there's

934
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,410
interesting stories to be told from this

935
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,210
particular type of data there are a lot

936
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,569
of other companies that monitor DNS were

937
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,610
by far not the only one that's certainly

938
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,710
true but we're the only one talking

939
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,930
about this and we're the only one who

940
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,490
came forward and talked about what we

941
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,870
found with the Trump Organization we're

942
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,609
the only one that came forward that

943
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,529
talked about what we found with the GOP

944
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,690
and the anti Comey domains and when the

945
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,580
only one that has made a public

946
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,740
announcement that I've seen so far that

947
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,710
is using our own resources to actually

948
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,299
monitor and track smear campaigns and

949
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,650
misinformation and misdirection with

950
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,760
respect to the midterm election so I

951
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,300
like to think that we're a little bit

952
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,140
different

953
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,270
but thank you for your question thank

954
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:10,160
you

955
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:12,810
[Applause]

956
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,839
hi did you also happen to look at the

957
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:18,299
DNS resolution for MX records especially

958
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,480
around the end of yes yeah we we track

959
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,870
about 25 different data points including

960
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,970
NS records as well yeah interesting yeah

961
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,279
absolutely yeah yeah and you know they

962
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,540
can get you so far you know sometimes

963
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,220
you find some interesting things and

964
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,330
sometimes it's more the Delta and the NS

965
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,810
records that are interesting than

966
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,940
anything else

967
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,259
yes well the email servers in particular

968
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,870
just changed right around the end of

969
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,630
2016 which is just a pretty interesting

970
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,089
move and they went from a larger mail

971
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,580
servers for Trump org and for ijk family

972
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:50,640
from things like Outlook and right eh

973
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:53,069
down to a boutique IT firm yeah that's

974
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,410
true so generally what we'll do sort of

975
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,150
within our firm so we we provide this

976
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,580
monitoring service we identify these

977
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,470
squatters and then we within the same

978
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:04,230
shop we take them down we utilize the

979
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,790
You DRP process or you know if it's

980
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,650
something more pernicious if we're start

981
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,660
seeing NS records change like that in a

982
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:12,030
pernicious manner then we'll be the guys

983
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,129
will collect that evidence and then

984
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,170
relay the case over to the hosts that

985
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,490
perhaps if necessary these domains

986
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,110
should be synced hold so that we can

987
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,680
then begin to collect forensic evidence

988
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,680
from them

989
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:26,460
hi we've got a couple years left before

990
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,870
we get back into the you know the

991
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,640
presidential race I wonder if you

992
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,710
brought this down to like the level of

993
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,150
senators and things like that to see if

994
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,680
there's anything going on at that yes

995
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,390
that's exactly what we're doing that's

996
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,980
exactly what we're doing and I have you

997
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,990
have you seen anything yet anything for

998
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,460
women yes yes that was sort of the last

999
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,959
point of presentation and we've made

1000
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,420
some very interesting findings there

1001
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,970
we've actually even you know we take the

1002
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,500
advice of DHS if we see something we say

1003
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,149
something if we think it's worth saying

1004
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,890
something we've literally picked up the

1005
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,690
phone and called campaigns and I will

1006
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,950
tell you that when you pick up the phone

1007
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,810
you call them and you tell them about a

1008
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,129
recently registered domain that's being

1009
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,220
configured in a way that could be a

1010
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,990
spearfishing threat or a smear campaign

1011
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,250
they're very thankful because they

1012
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,109
didn't know about it they weren't

1013
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,410
monitoring this in the first place and

1014
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,660
so you know we consider it to be a use

1015
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,868
of our resources for the public good and

1016
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:20,549
doing that thank you

1017
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:25,519
I think we might have time for one more

1018
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:27,809
question perhaps if it's a quick one

1019
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,118
have you explored the interaction not

1020
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,249
only with DNS records but I guess the

1021
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,470
implications on SEO and such along those

1022
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,910
lines about how these can lead to that

1023
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:38,279
and the spread of misinformation

1024
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,190
accordingly not necessarily so much with

1025
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:43,559
SEO a little bit with SEO but it is

1026
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,210
something I would like to explore

1027
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,039
further if you have any particular

1028
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,480
insight into that come find us we're

1029
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,490
down on the mezzanine level right up

1030
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,230
side the escalators will be there and

1031
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,569
I'll be here all weekend and all night

1032
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,400
and I look forward to meeting all of you

1033
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:57,440
further thank you all for listening I

1034
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,850
think my time is up

1035
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,159
thank you

1036
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:05,159
[Applause]
