1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,589
hello everyone there is something I'm

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,850
trying to do with this as well which is

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,170
a little different you'll notice at the

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,230
bottom there is both my Twitter handle

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,090
and a hashtag Co H DMV for people that

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,860
are watching online or people that might

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,198
be anxious about actually asking

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,990
question feel free to tweet me with that

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,140
hashtag and your question may follow up

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,000
this talk now a little bit about about

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,640
this talk first off this is gonna be

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,220
focusing on the US and Canada context

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,420
because of how these documents that were

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,140
gonna be talking we're gonna be focusing

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,460
on are treated in these countries very

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,540
few in most other countries there's

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,300
something of a national identity card

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,680
driver's licenses are not frequently

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,290
accepted as a form of valid

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,550
identification all the information that

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,230
you're seeing here is present but from

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,059
open sources I mentioned this because I

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,269
did spend seven years working for a

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,940
state driver services agency including a

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,590
couple years in their law enforcement

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,129
agency I worked as a civilian my main

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,449
job was keeping them honest

28
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:03,000
however just want to make that clear and

29
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,099
again like I said tweet me questions you

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,260
might get answers of course the first

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,600
thing is everyone here that has

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,840
experience in North America has gone to

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
a DMV we call DMV MVA drivers services

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,400
what have you pretty much in North

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,658
American society you need a credential

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,939
from one of these agencies be at an

37
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,540
actual driving license or a non driver

38
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,298
identification card so the first part of

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,270
the process of identity management if

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,470
you will is the actual front of the

41
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,798
house where you come up where you start

42
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,090
the process of getting the card issuance

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,400
today is a lot different than it used to

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,560
be in some places around the world they

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,030
still will issue on the spot pretty much

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,890
every jurisdiction in North America now

47
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,119
issues via what's called central

48
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,950
issuance meaning they mail you a

49
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,899
credential for some people that might

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,490
seem like okay that's been the case

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,659
forever but for in some jurisdictions

52
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,419
that is still relatively new currently

53
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,790
ID cards are highly influenced in the US

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,700
by the Real ID Act now there's a lot of

55
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,930
misconceptions about the Real ID Act is

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,270
the short version at least from my point

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,220
of view is it's a good idea except

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,920
that's implemented 180 degrees wrong

59
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,800
Amba is the entity that defines the

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,750
standards for these documents in the US

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
and Canada Amba is the American

62
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,260
Association of motor vehicle

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,609
administrators essentially it's the

64
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,989
industry group for DMVs they define

65
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,210
technical standards for things like

66
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,270
license plates driver's licenses title

67
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,180
documents and they do of course lobby

68
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,370
like every interest industry group does

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,490
the standard that is used for driver's

70
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,980
licenses is inspired by but not entirely

71
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,980
ISO compliant there is an iso standard

72
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,079
for licenses anybody that is from europe

73
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,410
will know for example that they are pink

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,140
that is the actual ISO color for driving

75
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,430
licences and finally at least in North

76
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,809
America there's only three companies

77
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:08,260
that actually issue these documents I

78
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:10,760
hate that this mic is hopping on me now

79
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,590
the front half staff that's people that

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm referring to front of the house back

81
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,100
of the house which feels a little more

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,420
convenient for me but we're talking

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,299
about the people that you interact with

84
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
as a member of the public versus the

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,200
people that are in back offices doing

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,060
other work their job is to serve as a

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,530
first line of fraud detection when we

88
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,350
talk about fraud of course we're talking

89
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,200
about in this context we're talking

90
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,329
about imposters and counterfeit source

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,619
documents you're not likely to find a

92
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,620
lot of people coming in with counterfeit

93
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,820
driver's licenses or ID cards if you're

94
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,860
working there because generally speaking

95
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,609
a beautiful at work there they know what

96
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,500
they should look like applications

97
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,970
require verification of documents

98
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,530
presented we'll go into that in a moment

99
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,930
and the newest trend which is a Real ID

100
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,670
related development is that document

101
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,489
that the agencies will save scanned

102
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,600
copies of what is presented where do

103
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,130
they keep them they keep them in

104
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,799
databases that are internal to that

105
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:14,060
agency more about that in a moment

106
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,220
in the u.s. one of the main

107
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,620
verifications that you'll find is called

108
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,229
social security online verification or s

109
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,789
solve when you go to the DMV

110
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,560
pretty much every jurisdiction I've seen

111
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,690
requires either the actual social

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,470
security card

113
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,410
or a w-2 or 1099 form with that number

114
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,380
on there in some places to let you just

115
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,570
say it the in reality they could just

116
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,070
let you say it anywhere because this is

117
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,820
the this is considered the authoritative

118
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:45,070
way of verifying it this is an anvil

119
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,050
database I'm sorry is an and the system

120
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,040
that hooks into Social Security's

121
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,860
systems

122
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,630
when the clerk enters that information

123
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,120
on to their system they're entering the

124
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,810
actual social security number legal name

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,950
date of birth and gender gender right

126
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,720
now is not used as a marker for

127
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,030
verification though considering the

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,320
inclinations of this administration in

129
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,549
DC that could change when it works right

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,990
they just said it just says go ahead

131
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,150
gives it an error code of zero other

132
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,740
error codes that come up include things

133
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,200
like there's a no match on the name this

134
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,150
happens more frequent than you'd think

135
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,620
and not for malicious reasons primarily

136
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,109
we've got a lot of folks out there that

137
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,580
do change their names legally if they

138
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,800
don't tell Social Security about that

139
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,140
man change Social Security doesn't know

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,330
this throws an error things happen

141
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,400
date of birth may not match some people

142
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
have their dates of birth inverted so

143
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,429
for instance if you were born on five

144
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,650
six thirteen which one is it or is it

145
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,390
May sixth or is it the sixth or is it

146
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,609
the fifth of June sometimes there are

147
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,680
such errors that happen even in this

148
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,250
country in this host country and finally

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,230
is the SSN in the death file 75 million

150
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,460
Social Security numbers are there some

151
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,240
people might want to impersonate someone

152
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,409
who's passed on that's where these

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,570
systems come into play

154
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,240
additional verifications come into play

155
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,820
for for individuals that are

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,250
non-citizens the save system is a DHS

157
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,360
program it's been up for I believe a

158
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:16,660
decade now it is used almost every

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,270
agency will use it for non-residents

160
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,270
citizen non-citizens that have status

161
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm using very specific language I know

162
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,210
so I'm talking about people that that

163
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,349
are in a status but are not residents

164
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:33,280
things like h1 workers or students or

165
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,190
their dependents Oh to 802 or the

166
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,049
dependents of outstanding individuals in

167
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,770
the US a two are certain diplomatic

168
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:46,190
staff yes these agencies do occasionally

169
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,620
issue credentials to people that are

170
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,719
have some kind of a diplomatic visa that

171
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,509
is not common usually ironically enough

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,940
the Department of State has its own DMV

173
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,669
that is what they call it to cover

174
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,740
licenses for diplomats and consuls

175
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,409
Canadian DMVs do a similar process for

176
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,789
individual for City for non-citizens and

177
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,729
for citizens that are born outside of

178
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:13,310
the country they verify dot the route

179
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,389
documents presented with appropriate

180
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,819
with the Citizenship and Immigration

181
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:21,889
Canada others other things that need to

182
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,440
be checked out are is your driving what

183
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,569
are you decent behind the wheel it's for

184
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,050
lack of a better way of putting it be

185
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,539
DPS problem driver pointer system it

186
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,159
lets agencies know if you've some

187
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,280
outstanding problem in another

188
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,599
jurisdiction some outstanding problem is

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,698
a very vague term and that is

190
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,819
deliberately so that could be anything

191
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,490
from you have a tendency to drink before

192
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,440
you drive and have twenty duis or it

193
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,009
could be that you forgot to pay a stop

194
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,349
sign ticket in in bumble blood I don't

195
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:55,610
know which one it is if I'm behind the

196
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,580
counter I won't know which one it is

197
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,229
unless you resolve it the idea being

198
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,120
that if you're not able to drive in one

199
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,219
jurisdiction then you will not be

200
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,770
allowed to drive in another of course

201
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:08,599
these source specific our concerning

202
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,650
driver's licenses ID cards obviously

203
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,240
don't have these checks see the CD list

204
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,669
commercial driver license information

205
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,960
system is a little more in-depth for

206
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,840
individuals that drive commercial

207
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,169
vehicles commercial drivers have a lot

208
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,710
of rules on them it is very easy for a

209
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,270
bad driver to slip a foul of those rules

210
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,460
they could be under suspensions there

211
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,348
are certain offenses for which they can

212
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,539
lose their ability to drive a CDL for

213
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,740
life as an example and I think everyone

214
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,559
here would agree this is probably a good

215
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,229
one if you are intoxicated and driving a

216
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:46,939
vehicle full of hazardous cargo you're

217
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,920
banned from driving a CDL for life I re

218
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,470
is the Canadian version into provincial

219
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,529
records exchange again that primarily is

220
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,180
to trade records between ten

221
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,129
in provinces but it does hook into the

222
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,170
u.s. system the u.s. system also hooks

223
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:02,459
into the Canadian system now in the

224
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,529
future there are two things that are

225
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,359
being worked on the first one is called

226
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,100
state to state this is to make sure that

227
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,670
individuals don't have want more than

228
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,209
one driver's license or ID in the

229
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,009
country

230
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,339
ideally they want to expand it so it

231
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:20,300
includes Canada the idea is to have

232
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,889
authority control over the driver record

233
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,389
they want to make sure that if you have

234
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,040
what happens with the state to state is

235
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,180
if you apply you have a driver's license

236
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,189
from somewhere else even if you don't

237
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,138
present it the person behind the counter

238
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,730
will be aware of that existence and then

239
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,740
basically give you the agony of choice

240
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,079
between getting the new license or

241
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,240
keeping the old one

242
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,769
finally electronic verification of vital

243
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,059
events is primarily concerned with birth

244
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:47,249
certificates issued in the US now this

245
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,240
is admittedly a pilot a pilot that

246
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:50,309
failed but they are still investigating

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,110
this because they want to be able to

248
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:53,639
verify all the route documents that are

249
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,529
presented something I didn't mention

250
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,660
here or what I mean by a route document

251
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,850
these are these are the papers that you

252
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,719
show that provide you with proof of

253
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,040
identity right does being in a way so

254
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,300
think of your birth certificate does it

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,819
have a photo of you does it have

256
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,800
fingerprints foot for DNA on there no

257
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,469
you present the birth certificate that

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,550
says your name is Chuck Jones generally

259
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,389
speaking they're gonna think that you

260
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,490
are Chuck Jones obviously this is a weak

261
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,980
point same with social security cards in

262
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,689
the United States you present so you

263
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,819
present Chuck Jones's Social Security

264
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,019
card in a situation like this there is a

265
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:35,309
tendency to think that you are tough

266
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:37,980
Jones still learning how to use this

267
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:40,439
properly so I apologize for the hiccups

268
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,730
in the talk now as I mentioned with

269
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,349
issuance that's the process of actually

270
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,029
turning that little piece of plastic

271
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,089
into something that will let you buy a

272
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,889
beer have just about every jurisdiction

273
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,779
use essential issuance to my knowledge

274
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:53,339
the last one that didn't was Delaware

275
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,679
because they have exactly one office

276
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,990
that issues driver's licenses which

277
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,889
means that functionally speaking it's

278
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,899
the same thing what that means also is

279
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,670
that it's sent by mail in an unmarked

280
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,210
envelope from a secure facility as I'll

281
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,099
say

282
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,130
however these secure facilities are run

283
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,500
by three companies in North America

284
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,020
the first one is ID Mia this company has

285
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,510
changed names twice since I've started

286
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,180
following this they used to be known as

287
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:24,270
Morpho trust saffron I believe is their

288
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,469
parent company it's a mess I know people

289
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,660
are gonna think Canadian make not wait a

290
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,300
minute money company well yeah they do

291
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,810
more than just currency they also

292
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,609
produce identity documents Canadian

293
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,500
driver's license is personal opinion are

294
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,520
slightly higher quality documents than

295
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,550
you typically find in from most USA

296
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,870
states and gemalto Gemalto again for

297
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,979
those of you who aren't aware of who

298
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,000
Gemalto is they're a major multinational

299
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,700
they are involved in credit card smart

300
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,100
cards identity documents you name it and

301
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,140
finally about the future of issuance now

302
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,020
this is actually an existing product as

303
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,020
of I think about three weeks ago it's

304
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,880
called la wallet this is Louisiana this

305
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,850
is to put your driver's license on your

306
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,870
phone this is a tendency that isn't

307
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,240
something that a lot of states are

308
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,540
looking into because people don't like

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,260
carrying wallets around this connects

310
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,120
real-time to the omv servers as they

311
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,650
call it in Louisiana so you would

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,220
produce this it would say when they last

313
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,540
Seraph ID that it was valid and this is

314
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,980
a mobile driver's license now some of

315
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,449
you might think why am i saying mobile

316
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,290
instead of digital not just because it's

317
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,000
a phone but because the term digital

318
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,939
driver's license at least within the

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,050
industry refers to the current types of

320
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,480
plastic cars we get because those are

321
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:46,890
digitally produced yes I know I didn't

322
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,270
name it I'm just letting you know what

323
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,760
it is now finally about securing the

324
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,430
credential back in the day I mean I'm

325
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,689
sure that some of you remember getting a

326
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,050
card that was a laminated piece of

327
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:01,829
Polaroid film I know that was my first

328
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,420
driver's license an ID card nowadays

329
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:05,250
let's start with the camera that you're

330
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,469
staring down when you get the image what

331
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,770
you don't see in that pillar is a 15 to

332
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,440
20 megapixel prosumer camera they want

333
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,910
to get a good image not just because

334
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,320
well they want to make sure everyone

335
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,529
knows how ugly you are when you get the

336
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,529
card

337
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,440
we're gonna go into that part of it in a

338
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,180
moment the substrates the actual card

339
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,959
material is distribution controlled

340
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,819
similar to how banknote paper is most

341
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,849
cars that you find in the US are based

342
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,890
on PE T or PFC usually a combination of

343
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,570
both of these materials that's why it

344
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,970
has that sort of feel to it now newer

345
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,730
cards like you'll find in New York wash

346
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,079
most Canadian provinces Virginia

347
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,839
Washington DC those are probably

348
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,390
carbonate based similar to some

349
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,399
passports have you have polycarbonate

350
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,040
info sheets the idea being that these

351
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,490
are nearly impossible as far as I've

352
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,620
been able to research to counterfeit you

353
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,769
just do not find a good fake Virginia

354
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,029
license anywhere there are multiple

355
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,220
layers of security I'm gonna go a little

356
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,100
bit I'm gonna gloss over the details of

357
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,160
this for because I'm going to talk a

358
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,149
little more in the next slide whenever

359
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,279
you look at these documents there's

360
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,079
three levels of security there's over

361
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,439
security things that you can see with a

362
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,540
naked eye so as an example of an overt

363
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,820
security feature that you'll see in the

364
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,860
New York driver's license which has the

365
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,810
clear window that you can see the same

366
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,380
image through that's an overt security

367
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,739
feature covert features are things that

368
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,660
are not immediately visible whenever you

369
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,079
see that bouncer flash that UV light on

370
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,930
to your document that UV is considered a

371
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,660
covert feature other covert features

372
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:51,439
include things like micro text

373
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,899
deliberate errors certain certain

374
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,550
features of Holograms and finally our

375
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,649
forensic features trying to find out

376
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,219
information on forensic features working

377
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:03,760
through an open-source context that's

378
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,010
hard to put it mildly

379
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,569
forensic features are used often by

380
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,449
programs that automatically determine if

381
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,339
the credential is valid sometimes it's

382
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,649
sometimes it's considered forensic

383
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,269
information to read the barcode on the

384
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,519
back of a driver's license particularly

385
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:23,870
since most of them have an encrypted

386
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,490
portion now with regard to these

387
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,980
features there's an excellent guide that

388
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,810
you can get the ice guide to document

389
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,880
security features because this was a

390
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,150
design for Immigration and Customs and

391
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,430
for

392
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,589
this does have a focus on passports

393
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,699
however the same features you'll find in

394
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:42,560
passports you'll find a lot of them in

395
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,900
identity documents too I do have a short

396
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
link here file dot IO yada yada

397
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,050
I am tweeting this after the talk so

398
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,170
that way you don't have to remember

399
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,240
which is a capital letter or not and

400
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,370
keep in mind that this is a work of the

401
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:01,820
United States government as such it is

402
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:03,230
free of copyright share and enjoy now

403
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,610
finally we're gonna talk about the fun

404
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,260
part what most of you are here for I

405
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,410
presume the stuff that happens you don't

406
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,140
see like I said I did work for the law

407
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,360
enforcement agency of this DMV for

408
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,160
several years this is one aspect of it

409
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,350
but we're gonna talk about what happens

410
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,230
after keep in mind that every driver

411
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,360
services agency is either itself a

412
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,020
branch of a law enforcement agency or

413
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,100
has a law enforcement arm examples Texas

414
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,720
Department of Public Safety is the

415
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,000
entity that issues a driver's license or

416
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,029
ID card in the state of Texas this is a

417
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,050
police agency ICBC Special

418
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,310
Investigations Unit is a section of the

419
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,800
Insurance Corporation of British

420
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,170
Columbia the driving and the driver and

421
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,650
vehicle license licensing agency in

422
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,390
British Columbia not everyone there is a

423
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,920
cop not everyone works for the cops but

424
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,040
these people do they specifically look

425
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,860
for certain things now regarding IDs I'm

426
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,569
going to focus obviously on that the

427
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,839
first one is investigating post issuance

428
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,520
fraud investigating counterfeits

429
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,470
identification of investigatory subjects

430
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,720
so we're gonna start with the fraud desk

431
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:13,100
every agency has a fraud desk now as I'm

432
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,780
sure that this is gonna be shocking

433
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,419
considering the reputation of a lot of

434
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,920
driver services people not all of this

435
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,880
fraud is caught and when they go to the

436
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,050
office okay yes for those of you who are

437
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,670
familiar with the Simpsons there are

438
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,760
still a lot of Patties and Selma's

439
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,530
they're pro tip the younger the person

440
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,160
is the less likely they are to be that

441
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,110
way now how do they investigate these

442
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,660
claims the first one is they get reports

443
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,879
from law enforcement they get reports

444
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,460
from they get also documents have been

445
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,370
returned to them in the US for example

446
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,140
under the Real ID standards into

447
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,409
has to present documents verifying

448
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,110
address if something gets kicked back

449
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,650
that should be going to a legit address

450
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:59,129
there's an ink that automatically

451
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,050
insinuates there is something wrong

452
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,730
now over the counter that's what OTC is

453
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,010
back in the day when you just go into

454
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,510
the office and walk out with a card once

455
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,500
those cards were issued and out in the

456
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,379
field there's not much that could be

457
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,420
done with it this of course is a problem

458
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,210
when you're trying to ensure that that

459
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:21,460
document is trusted everyone here at

460
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,900
some point has had to trust that that

461
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,309
piece of plat assuming that again

462
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,679
assuming in North American context it

463
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,340
had to trust that that piece of plastic

464
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,960
accurately represented who that person

465
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,428
was at least in a legal context once

466
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,990
it's in the wild and it's got someone

467
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,030
else's face on it that's it there's not

468
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,520
much that can be done if you're lucky as

469
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,870
the agency they might come back for

470
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,300
another service and you might discover

471
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:47,260
it then that doesn't happen that often I

472
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,240
have experienced that finally without

473
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,610
with current issues with the central

474
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,940
issuance every application has facial

475
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,620
recognition run on it not for the reason

476
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,260
you might think though so we're gonna

477
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,750
talk about the la policia of course most

478
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,980
frequently what they do is they respond

479
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,420
to information requests from other

480
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:10,530
agencies whether we're talking about you

481
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,630
know podunk or we're talking about

482
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,639
California it could be any age any law

483
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,929
enforcement agency could be asking them

484
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,880
I mean there have been cases where I've

485
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,640
personally had to respond to different

486
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,490
federal agencies and to military police

487
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,010
to provide them with information of for

488
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,300
example the status of the document or if

489
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,179
there is something that they received

490
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,550
back in an automated return which they

491
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:36,700
don't understand because there are times

492
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:39,510
where a record will go to somebody some

493
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,850
authorized receiver it'll say contact

494
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:46,629
contact agency police because there's

495
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,059
it's a weird situation now again the

496
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,950
vast majority of the time as I sort of

497
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:55,899
implied there these responses are sent

498
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,730
automatically agency a goes on to a

499
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,110
secured law enforcement agents to the

500
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,580
secure law enforcement net

501
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,080
work sends a request to the DMV's police

502
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,000
agency they get a response

503
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,500
examples of these networks are things

504
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,780
like nice spin New York State Police

505
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:15,010
information network see let's is the

506
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,260
California law enforcement I keep

507
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,590
forgetting the T in that one leads is

508
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,000
the law enforcement and acquisition data

509
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,490
system I keep forgetting some of these

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,870
acronyms it's annoying

511
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,840
every state has its own network they all

512
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,580
hooked in two in the US each state has

513
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,559
its own system each state has a

514
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,049
different name for it they all hook into

515
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,799
the FBI's master network which is known

516
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:40,840
as n let's Canada a little different

517
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,220
keep in mind in Canada you basically

518
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,870
they have one large police agency that

519
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,490
covers the whole country which is the

520
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:50,320
RCMP different cities and towns have

521
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,360
outpost of RCMP acting under contract or

522
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,840
their own police departments they all

523
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,280
communicate pretty easily that way now

524
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,870
of course let's talk about this your

525
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,940
threat model because obviously as soon

526
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:06,459
as I say facial recognition a lot of

527
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:08,500
people's heads should start to spin of

528
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,290
course like I said it's pretty simple

529
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,640
yes they do facial recognition okay and

530
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,620
this is the sort of thing that people

531
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,110
are worried about in let's be real here

532
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,659
no this is not what it looks like in the

533
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:27,729
real world at least from the DMV point

534
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,870
of view now as soon as you take a photo

535
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,190
that's enrolled in their database

536
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,219
everyone here should know all about

537
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,690
enrolling facial recognition feet for

538
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,669
facial recognition you dump pictures

539
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,980
into a database system figures it out

540
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,080
now in some jurisdictions you take the

541
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,000
photo before you do anything else in

542
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,949
that case even if you decide after that

543
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,270
photo is taken to walk out that photo

544
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,580
will still be enrolled even if it

545
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:53,110
doesn't have necessarily identifier

546
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,790
associated with it modern ID photos for

547
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,250
driver's licenses and ID cards are in

548
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,690
spite are very much iCal standards are

549
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,970
the same standards that you'll find for

550
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,730
your passport to put it in three

551
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:08,029
sentences flat front of the face neutral

552
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:10,649
expression ideally without glasses

553
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,779
now keep in mind that because this is

554
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:15,570
the standard there's only one image

555
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,980
that's being used or if you have a

556
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,059
history with them several images but

557
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,419
they're all gonna be similar images

558
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:24,450
facial recognition is not very good when

559
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,620
it comes to using small sample sets okay

560
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,350
keep in mind States with cheap

561
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:33,330
contractors are pricey good fr is

562
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:35,490
relatively expensive so there are limits

563
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,860
to this system that make them a little

564
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,620
less scary the first one is the front

565
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,158
view of the face even a side view like

566
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:48,149
this is not going to be very easy at all

567
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,220
possible for those systems to match now

568
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:51,600
and I these are the ideal use cases for

569
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,649
this system though because there are

570
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,139
some the first one is comparing

571
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:58,768
databases between jurisdictions looking

572
00:22:55,139 --> 00:23:00,629
up mug shots and of course passport and

573
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:04,590
immigration credential comparison why

574
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,809
same standard for photo now what this

575
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,600
what now this is what DM VFR really

576
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,250
sucks at okay basically everything else

577
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,610
so you look at these surveillance type

578
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,169
images not a chance

579
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,539
cell phone footage unless you're lucky

580
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:20,370
enough to get a front out of the face

581
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,750
probably not mass footage think of the

582
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,178
think of some of the private sector

583
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,970
samples where they've scanned sports a

584
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,010
sports ball arena what would happen

585
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,360
well resolution I mean I'm looking at

586
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,419
this picture here and seeing this I'm

587
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,918
like I've seen pictures that are this

588
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,990
quality and slightly better that haven't

589
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,820
been able to get through the Fr at our

590
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,950
agency and finally of course fishing

591
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,649
expeditions no fishing expedition I know

592
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,500
that this person looks kind of like this

593
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:47,879
that will not go for both the simple

594
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,100
reason that you without an image to

595
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,919
compare even a good image even a bad

596
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,439
sketch won't work on these systems and

597
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,899
finally of course there are laws against

598
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,710
this yes I know

599
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:03,418
police laws insert joke here so this is

600
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,070
a case study of the former for example

601
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,190
in New York in New Jersey they did have

602
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:13,230
a cross database across analysis between

603
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:15,029
their systems literally thousands of

604
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,470
people were discovered to have multiple

605
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,299
active driver's licenses

606
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,940
obviously for this driver's licenses

607
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,780
were the primary focus but again they

608
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,420
also did checks

609
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,490
ID cards as well now these are a couple

610
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,200
of the cases of people they found that

611
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,390
we're using fake credentials the first

612
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,640
one being rather impressive a sanitation

613
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,260
worker impersonating their dead twin

614
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,450
brother to get half a million of

615
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,820
disability benefits over 20 years in New

616
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,890
York another one a fugitive that was on

617
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,780
the lam for 17 years was discovered

618
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,380
because they had multiple driver's

619
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,970
licenses

620
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,000
none of them had their actual identity

621
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,380
but they had they had one picture they

622
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,100
saw that these this thing came up

623
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,590
multiple times and they're like two plus

624
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,600
three came together in New Jersey there

625
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,980
was a man that used fraudulent IDs to

626
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,629
get commercial driver's licenses I

627
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,090
mentioned an example of this before this

628
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,510
dude had six duis and 64 license

629
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:12,780
suspensions and keep in mind I don't I

630
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,970
mean even in cases where you've got

631
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,780
someone patrolling you you do not find

632
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,130
people with 64 license suspensions okay

633
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,320
usually around number twenty three or

634
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,350
four or so most people get out from

635
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,129
behind the car in New York there were

636
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,060
twelve thousand five hundred cases found

637
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,000
but of these twelve thousand five

638
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:36,149
hundred cases only about three thousand

639
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,890
were prosecuted sometimes due to statute

640
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,750
of limitations reasons sometimes because

641
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,150
they found that they that the error was

642
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,850
on the clerk side in New Jersey they had

643
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,610
about two thousand cases that came up

644
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,709
only a thousand were prosecuted so again

645
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,570
this is probably this is to my knowledge

646
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,630
the only cross state database that

647
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,919
database run that has been performed

648
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,620
this will probably become more frequent

649
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,220
in the future as the cost of data and

650
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,219
processing power decreases now who

651
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,110
actually has the ability to search well

652
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,300
the cheap answer is it depends on the

653
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,570
jurisdiction or I worked there were

654
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,990
exactly eleven people that were allowed

655
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:19,110
to perform a facial recognition run over

656
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:24,050
those eleven five of them never did it

657
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:26,250
and I got tasked with most of the rest

658
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,169
obviously we don't do it capriciously we

659
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,900
have to receive a an authorized request

660
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,160
from a law enforcement agency each state

661
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,110
has different rules and guidelines on

662
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,520
this I happen to be in a state that was

663
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,320
very

664
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,270
serve it up in this regarding the only

665
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,580
reasons that you could run a check would

666
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,830
be to identify a body to identify a

667
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,929
missing person or if it's in connection

668
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,370
with a crime which they have to spell

669
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:53,210
out they can't say we think this person

670
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:54,929
did something most of these systems are

671
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,740
functionally air-gapped I say

672
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,650
functionally because you're not

673
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,760
completely isolated systems but these

674
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,520
are systems with extremely limited

675
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,379
access now in some states you even

676
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,150
require a court order example Washington

677
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,620
state requires a court order or a

678
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,500
warrant in order to be able to perform

679
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,929
such a run now some states on the other

680
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,130
hand there are a lot more liberal in

681
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,020
this regard and it's not exactly the

682
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,870
states that come up with that term for

683
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,520
example Kansas allows law enforcement

684
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,790
agencies to perform these searches with

685
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,830
frequency generally speaking in the

686
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,230
research I've been able to perform it

687
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,000
tracks across the red blue line blue

688
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,750
states tend to be more protective of

689
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,230
individuals information red states are

690
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:39,900
more willing to share and some work

691
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,880
directly with federal agencies now what

692
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,920
do I mean by directly now again I worked

693
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,400
I regularly had inquiries from federal

694
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,730
agents

695
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,200
protip working the police is probably

696
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,570
the best thing I could have ever done to

697
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,010
learn how to social engineer someone

698
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,510
because being able to talk with people

699
00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:00,590
and actually have something resembling

700
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:03,810
authority is hard dealing with feds

701
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,500
harder some of them just want everything

702
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,120
now now now

703
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:12,260
and you've got to tell them sorry can't

704
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,699
help you which is about the most

705
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:19,680
rewarding thing to ever do is to tell a

706
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,940
Fed you know but some of them don't even

707
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,260
bother with it they just send it and

708
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,000
they'll just process it right away

709
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:28,650
again like I said this tends to track

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,570
the red blue state divided and now let's

711
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:34,350
talk about this why am i concerned about

712
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,899
knowing your threat model where is the

713
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,490
real threats for facial recognition are

714
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,180
these are these agencies really the

715
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,830
threat they're not really look at the

716
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,320
private sector and look at what they're

717
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,699
capable of doing right now for instance

718
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Amazon has been rolling out this

719
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,250
recognition system

720
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,080
and they've been pushing it to law

721
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,630
enforcement agencies they enroll mug

722
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,460
their mug shots which mug shots Republic

723
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:02,429
Records folks try not to get one

724
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,120
Facebook is probably the world's most

725
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:08,490
effective image enrollment system

726
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,799
they're deep face software is capable

727
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:19,490
identifying faces even obscured and

728
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:22,470
partial faces at 97% accuracy Google

729
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,529
same thing whenever you upload their

730
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,899
face that software just works a standard

731
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:30,120
date a standard test batch of faces

732
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:32,279
their accuracy is ninety nine point six

733
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,090
percent that is more accurate than a

734
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:38,669
human for reference ninety seven point

735
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,158
five percent is the standard for human

736
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:43,769
facial recognition

737
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,090
Microsoft has its face API and these are

738
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:47,009
just the big players of course there are

739
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,080
tons of other companies out there that

740
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:51,269
will work on for this again private

741
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,879
sector facial recognition all the little

742
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:57,600
brothers are much more advanced than

743
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:58,860
what you find in the public sector so

744
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,719
I'm gonna open the floor for questions

745
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,149
first off if you're here queue at the

746
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,269
mic if not send me a tweet I'm gonna be

747
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:09,080
monitoring it on this and I thank you

748
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:09,080
for your time in advance

749
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,080
yeah question how did you and how do

750
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,120
other DMVs authenticate requests for

751
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,460
information whether it's personal

752
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,449
information or facial recognition from

753
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:33,470
law enforcement agencies and quarters

754
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:36,770
the vast majority of requests either are

755
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,140
entirely through or are started via

756
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,780
secure law enforcement networks such as

757
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:45,500
what I mentioned nice pin see--let's

758
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,000
leads you name it either they will send

759
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,490
the information directly through that

760
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,170
network which again it each state

761
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,030
network is connected to the FBI network

762
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:56,330
FBI actually sets the standards for

763
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:58,700
these networks and determine and the

764
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,659
State Police of each state determines

765
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:06,080
who has access to it it's pretty it's

766
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:10,070
pretty reliable as such now sometimes

767
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
places used to issue the address they

768
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,250
would call let's say I let's say

769
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,550
somebody was to call me up and say hi

770
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,230
I'm officer Davis from the blah-blah

771
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,860
Police Department and here's the address

772
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,160
on the network that used to be a lot

773
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:28,129
more common but the technical term for

774
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,470
that address is known as an Ori those

775
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,550
who are I lists are available

776
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:37,960
consequently more agencies are not

777
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:41,149
trusting them could you comment on the

778
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,520
commercialization of DMV data meaning

779
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,400
are the DMV selling data to the

780
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,160
marketing agencies and is is there a way

781
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,990
to opt out of that or anything that we

782
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,100
should be concerned with thank you

783
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,190
I'll start with the second part of that

784
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,929
question about opting out to my

785
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,490
knowledge it is not possible to opt out

786
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,250
of it however it's not just it's not

787
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,490
used for marketing in most cases usually

788
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,830
an entity that wants to access DMV data

789
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,020
like that has to have a business case

790
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,120
for it what do I mean something like an

791
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,190
insurance company has a business case

792
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,600
for it someone trying to sell you three

793
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,220
pairs of socks on the Internet does not

794
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,020
now what defines a business case will

795
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,310
vary from state to state again from what

796
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,120
I've been able to find it does follow

797
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,120
that red blue line

798
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,930
hi I live in Vermont and in the past two

799
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,680
years we had a little bit of a scandal

800
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:39,560
where folks who worked at the DMV did I

801
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:41,150
lose the mic yes so folks who worked at

802
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,730
the DMV would sort of casually

803
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,880
collaborate with ice and they'd sort of

804
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,410
sent an email and say hey Steve and ice

805
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,820
we have a you know an undocumented

806
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,710
immigrant coming in tomorrow for a

807
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,810
driver's test and ice would come down

808
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,210
and pick the person up so my question is

809
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,470
how common is that sort of thing in

810
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,590
other states or any kind of other

811
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:03,050
similar collaboration there's a reason

812
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,720
this is considered a scandal and that is

813
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:08,360
because pretty much every jurisdiction

814
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,010
that in the u.s. that issues driving

815
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,060
credential for individuals without

816
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:16,070
status has either official policies or

817
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,240
unofficial statements to the effect that

818
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:23,240
they do not disclose immigration status

819
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,930
either directly or indirectly to federal

820
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:31,520
authorities the state I worked in did

821
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:33,620
have did and does have a policy of does

822
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,740
have a program for issuing licenses to

823
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,139
individuals without status when this

824
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,320
program as I said I kept this I kept my

825
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,820
agency honest one of the markers that I

826
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,560
discovered was that in some of the

827
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,350
information that would otherwise be

828
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,220
lawful to release it identified whether

829
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:54,260
the individual had status or not and

830
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,150
because of what I did I ensured that as

831
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,230
a pollen though it wasn't an official

832
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,270
policy this was something that the

833
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,970
people in charge of the agency had been

834
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,110
promoting publicly our law I mean

835
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,910
literally I had to get pushed up

836
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,590
basically to all the lawyers who said

837
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,810
you know maybe it's not exactly the law

838
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,029
but this is what we've said publicly so

839
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:15,549
that information does need to be

840
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,550
redacted thank you

841
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,489
so loophole idea you don't need a

842
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,169
driver's license to ride a bicycle but

843
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,139
the NYPD has been cracking down on

844
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:28,908
cyclists and if you get stopped safe or

845
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,980
like running a red light you could

846
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:31,730
actually get points on your driver's

847
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,399
license

848
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:39,179
New York however also offers a

849
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,159
non-driver ID and so you could give them

850
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,980
and then there's no license to get

851
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,109
points on so would having a New York

852
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,940
state non-driver ID and then a

853
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:50,429
simultaneous driver's license from

854
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,250
another state raise any flags or is that

855
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:54,168
like just a terrible idea yeah that's a

856
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,240
terrible idea

857
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:59,720
I'll tell you why in a few in a few

858
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,450
different ways the first one is that

859
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,339
when you apply for a New York State non

860
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,020
driver identification card at least to

861
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,578
my knowledge of the process they do in

862
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,259
fact check to ensure that you don't have

863
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,809
a valid driving credential anywhere else

864
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,520
in the country so you go there you want

865
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,730
to get that ID card and they see that

866
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,430
you've got a license from Hawaii

867
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:23,839
well that might cause problems the

868
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,890
second aspect of this is that under the

869
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,538
under the wrote under the road rules

870
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,848
basically whatever laws are in effect

871
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:33,000
for that state or country for the road

872
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:34,049
the bicycle is considered a vehicle not

873
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,210
necessarily a motor vehicle but

874
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:39,630
obviously a vehicle and vehicles have to

875
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,279
follow the rules of the road so yes as a

876
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,559
biker you're supposed to stop at stop

877
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:47,250
signs and stoplights I know most of us

878
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,990
don't okay but yes they I know that in

879
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,359
particular New York City is particularly

880
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:56,250
aggressive about it about enforcing on

881
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,960
bikers and frankly as a honestly I think

882
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,970
that's not a bad thing and the reason

883
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,680
why is because at least with regards to

884
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,990
like running red lights for example I

885
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,930
don't like seeing bike bicyclists

886
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:11,669
getting splattered personal preference

887
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,319
but what happens is that a driver file

888
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,359
is created for you if you don't already

889
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,380
have a driver's license they just use

890
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,420
the information that they're able to

891
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,119
obtain from usually the citation and

892
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,440
they create a dummy file and if that

893
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,359
dummy file shows that there's nothing

894
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,680
resolved and you go to another state

895
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,390
let's say you go to someplace where you

896
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,190
need a car like you know Colorado they

897
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,140
will do a pdps search and they'll say

898
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,250
you've got a problem in New York I've

899
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,180
never had a license in New York well

900
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,180
they say you got some issue

901
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:46,180
hi there thanks for speaking curious on

902
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,490
your opinion about to potential

903
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:52,210
cross-sections based on your experiences

904
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:55,509
one is DHS fusion centers and the other

905
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:57,040
is a witness protection program address

906
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,640
confidentiality program members are

907
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,009
there any protections for them with

908
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,140
regard to facial recognition or

909
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,059
surveillance databases I do not have

910
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,220
direct knowledge a direct experience I

911
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:12,760
should say of fusion centers I never

912
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:15,609
interacted with a DHS fusion center I

913
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,880
did work with one or two County fusion

914
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:21,279
centers that were not explicitly DHS but

915
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,960
in those cases it was just usually a

916
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,859
request for information not a request to

917
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,200
do

918
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,390
for example facial recognition for

919
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,689
instance clarification on like vehicle

920
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,170
ownership or something that does happen

921
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:36,510
as far as I apologize I forgot the

922
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,109
second part of the question

923
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:43,000
witness protection every state has if

924
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,290
you will certain I mean has

925
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,359
considerations for certain protected

926
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,490
classes of persons now witness

927
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:49,960
protection does not fall into this and

928
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,270
the reason why is that witness

929
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,490
protections of federal program witness

930
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:58,000
protection people will usually have a

931
00:37:54,490 --> 00:38:01,118
contact with a every state has what's

932
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,880
known as a confidential Bisons desk it's

933
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,559
not for confidential for you to have

934
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,119
it's not like protecting you saying that

935
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,799
like yes I have a secret driver's

936
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,650
license no it's more like when law

937
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:13,240
enforcement needs credentials for

938
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,730
various purposes be it something like

939
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,990
witness protection or for undercover

940
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:21,549
investigations individuals that have

941
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,439
other privacy concerns or other

942
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:26,170
limitations on their ability to obtain a

943
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,839
credential cases like this include

944
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:32,099
judges in most states it includes first

945
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:36,819
responders domestic violence victims

946
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:38,650
parolees homeless there's usually a

947
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:41,680
procedure for them to get a credential

948
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:44,319
that doesn't show a home address as an

949
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,149
example again this is a hypothetical

950
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:48,009
example let's say that effect let's say

951
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,880
that a federal judge needs to get their

952
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,000
driver's license renewed

953
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,500
when they go they probably will have the

954
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,450
court

955
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,280
address on their license or a cop will

956
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,430
have their precinct house a homeless

957
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:07,290
person or a domestic violence victim may

958
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:08,730
have the address of a shelter that's a

959
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,590
really good point it brings in another

960
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,690
aspect you mentioned towards the end

961
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:17,220
that the Amazons and the googles have a

962
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:19,020
much better capabilities things like

963
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,450
Lincoln why see that it's not just

964
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,970
linking faces in real-time but also can

965
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,560
link up your phone your address and

966
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,850
where you live because of your work

967
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,580
patterns and all these kinds of things

968
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,980
what makes us think that this whether

969
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,690
local or state actors aren't actually

970
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,060
just kind of giving up the ghost and

971
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:39,840
gonna be using these sources of

972
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,820
corporate surveillance systems you know

973
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,980
that are multifaceted and just gonna

974
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,350
stop kind of doing the direct oh I'm an

975
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,670
NYPD surveillance camera and like you

976
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:54,060
know how are we gonna follow this in the

977
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,800
u.s. it is a lot easier and it is a lot

978
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,540
easier for law enforcement to get your

979
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,240
information from private parties than

980
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,690
from other parts of the government this

981
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,220
sounds weird but it's true there is the

982
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,860
doctrine the third-party doctrine which

983
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,049
with the exception only recently

984
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,740
established of cellphone count of

985
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:16,110
cellphone ping data if the third party

986
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,419
has your information they can do

987
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,460
whatever they want with it they can sell

988
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,740
it to law enforcement agencies a lot of

989
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,320
law enforcement agencies have have

990
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,020
contracts with for example LexisNexis or

991
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:33,960
other or other data brokers they have

992
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,970
that as an easier approach than going to

993
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,550
a DMV and trying to get that information

994
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,810
oftentimes it's more effective

995
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:46,020
conversely to my knowledge the DMV's

996
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:50,060
with very rare exception do not do that

997
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,060
same sort of information checking

998
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:56,350
hi so the DMV has Motor Vehicles in it

999
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,540
and I was wondering kind of the

1000
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:02,440
intersection of Motor Vehicles regards

1001
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:05,200
to like a LP ours EZ Pass anything

1002
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,760
involving photos of a notification or

1003
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,850
potentially your faces what's the

1004
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,860
intersection of that regards to I don't

1005
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,839
know I understand what you mean concerns

1006
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,900
about the actual the vehicle side of the

1007
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,960
DMV and license plates in other and

1008
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:25,000
tracking connected with that total

1009
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,980
agencies are separate from the DMV most

1010
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,240
of the entities that use a LPR to my

1011
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,800
knowledge receptor from the DMV I have

1012
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,000
yet to see a DMV that has an a LPR

1013
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,590
camera at its parking lot they can

1014
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
request the information again it has to

1015
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,280
be an authorized business purpose if

1016
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,470
they fight but usually like with say a

1017
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,350
toll tag they have to be able to

1018
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,970
document that you've been skipping tolls

1019
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,160
they can't just pull it up because you

1020
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:53,290
seem to be going slightly too fast for

1021
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,970
what physics dictate as possible ALPR

1022
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,610
companies they have to be able to show

1023
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:00,430
that in some states they just sell the

1024
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,930
data to bulk brokers again for a

1025
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,419
legitimate business case which again is

1026
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:07,390
I didn't find vehicles but again

1027
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:10,030
primarily it's going to be cases where

1028
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,450
it's to resolve some kind of outstanding

1029
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,900
criminal or civil issue that is

1030
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:19,799
justified in law the DMV itself doesn't

1031
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:23,380
have like a dog in the fight so much

1032
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,320
high Aphrodite my first question was

1033
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,770
just is this your first talk this is my

1034
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,390
first talk

1035
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,880
[Music]

1036
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,100
[Applause]

1037
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,150
[Music]

1038
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,279
after OGG has been hanging out at hope

1039
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,770
since like God died a trillion years ago

1040
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,050
and I don't know why that came to it but

1041
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,280
she started on in the security team and

1042
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,780
it's been totally around the edges being

1043
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,310
like but I know this stuff about the DMV

1044
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,750
I know this stuff about the DMV and only

1045
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,400
just now is like brought this all of us

1046
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,050
I just wanted to thank you because like

1047
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,369
this is my favorite kind of hope talk

1048
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,859
where it's like here's the system and

1049
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,640
all of how it works because I know it

1050
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:56,140
and I'm going to share it with you

1051
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,089
fantastic talk

1052
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,960
I may have derped out I missed I men may

1053
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,590
have missed the answer to my question

1054
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,440
but my question is just aside from first

1055
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,790
talk you said there's like a single

1056
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,950
image and it's just single image in the

1057
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:11,380
DMV files right and that's that flatland

1058
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:14,649
is that are we assuming that that's the

1059
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,940
only image also in the deeper fed

1060
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,080
systems or stuff like that or do we

1061
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,720
assume that they have other stuff that

1062
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,840
sort of comes into it there what the

1063
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,020
feds do it's a loop that's a little bit

1064
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,270
beyond my knowledge base except in the

1065
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,910
except that typically Maciel the FBI's

1066
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,470
database that they use in rolls mug

1067
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,850
shots as opposed to driver's license

1068
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,859
photos because a mug shot includes a

1069
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:41,740
side profile it can do slightly better

1070
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:43,660
identification but pretty much if you if

1071
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,700
you remember whatever cards you have no

1072
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,899
driver's license or IDs what do they all

1073
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,279
look like that unless you've got a

1074
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,910
really goofy face that you put in one

1075
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,170
back in the day it's gonna be a flat

1076
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,690
front shot of the face or if you've got

1077
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,920
the one guy like I went and one of the

1078
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,650
DMV guys looked at me like I'm gonna

1079
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,820
take a bad picture of you one time so is

1080
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,290
it likely that they'll also be able to

1081
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,730
cross-check against your passport photo

1082
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,880
how likely is that but that'll be able

1083
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:10,990
to me at this point I'm not likely with

1084
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,150
the exception of individual of typically

1085
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,589
non-citizens that are applying if they

1086
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,119
have to refer to a visa or something

1087
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,869
they have to do we have to check that

1088
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,130
image and if it's looks hinky there

1089
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,619
could be problems I do have a question

1090
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:26,859
that came on from Twitter the question

1091
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:28,869
is from the question is how accurate do

1092
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:32,369
you consider the data particularly home

1093
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:34,859
address slash geolocation in state data

1094
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,540
keep in mind it's all self-reported and

1095
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,069
at least in the u.s. context it requires

1096
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,109
documentation to prove it what

1097
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,310
documentation is accepted varies from

1098
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:43,360
state to state but usually it's

1099
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:50,190
something that has Attlee

1100
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:52,780
a veneer of a fish of official status so

1101
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,040
how accurate is it it's as accurate as

1102
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,330
the information that's presented now

1103
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,750
there are people of course that try to

1104
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:00,340
do things that are better that are

1105
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,430
outside of the law let's just say things

1106
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,810
like having things go to private post

1107
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:08,230
boxes for example is one of the most

1108
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,759
common but again that often

1109
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,340
once that's discovered we'll just get

1110
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,650
get the fraud people and/or the law

1111
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,030
enforcement arm involved right away so I

1112
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,340
do want to thank thank you for the

1113
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,230
question online next please I've got

1114
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,080
about four minutes okay I wanted to

1115
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,540
thank you for great talk and I wanted to

1116
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,180
ask some cities such as San Francisco

1117
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:31,210
New York have their own ID card system

1118
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:33,460
that kind of interacts and I wanted to

1119
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,080
know from the like database perspective

1120
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,210
or from an information sharing

1121
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,529
perspective how that interacts with the

1122
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:43,840
existing EMV systems from what I've been

1123
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,190
able to research in states which have

1124
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,320
cities that issue these kinds of

1125
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,960
credentials those documents are not

1126
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,420
accepted in any way shape or form at the

1127
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,310
DMV whether we're talking about an

1128
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:58,960
individual who has status who is a

1129
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:01,120
citizen or who has neither so as far as

1130
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,740
I'm aware there is no real intersection

1131
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,450
between them now what the states do with

1132
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,959
those now what the cities do with those

1133
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:10,569
databases of images I can't say it is

1134
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,540
reasonable to assume that facial

1135
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,790
recognition is run on those images

1136
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,460
however that is an assumption not

1137
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,930
something I can find hard information

1138
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:24,100
for you mentioned it's a bad idea to

1139
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,779
maintain multiple driver's licenses

1140
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,839
could you explain why and there's a

1141
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,610
second part when you say you move states

1142
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,050
you go to a new state you say I want to

1143
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:34,180
apply for a driver's license there is

1144
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,590
often an option that if you have a an

1145
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,730
active license in another state you can

1146
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,130
present that and skip the whole process

1147
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,710
right assuming you approved residency in

1148
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,540
that new state at that point what

1149
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,670
happens to your old license do they call

1150
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,630
up the DMV and say please invalidate

1151
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:52,140
this or what happens so the first part

1152
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,820
why it's bad idea and multiple licenses

1153
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,150
well the first reason I mean these are

1154
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,460
reasons in law and the reason is that

1155
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,809
you cannot have what's if you're in in

1156
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,950
some states it's more in some

1157
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:05,769
jurisdictions I should say it's a much

1158
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,689
more enveloping prohibition for in most

1159
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:09,249
states in the u.s. it is against the law

1160
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,989
to have a driver's license from that

1161
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:13,288
state and a driver's and an active

1162
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:16,180
driver's license from another state so

1163
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,920
if I did have say a Washington driver's

1164
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,779
license and a New York driver's license

1165
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,519
if I ever I mean and let's say that I'm

1166
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:22,900
driving through Oklahoma something

1167
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,689
happens they look at my wallet and they

1168
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,079
see that I have both Oklahoma could

1169
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,119
arrest me additional I mean that's a

1170
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,400
basic concept is called one driver one

1171
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,450
record the idea being that it's to make

1172
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,559
sure that if there are outstanding

1173
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,029
issues there's like a single

1174
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,489
authoritative source to get that

1175
00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:41,230
information in some places you can't

1176
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:43,450
even have a license from another country

1177
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:46,989
this is typical in Canada New York has

1178
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:49,210
this as a guideline as well so you are

1179
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,710
required to surrender licenses and

1180
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,519
typically that surrendering of the

1181
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:56,410
license is taken as proof of driving

1182
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:59,558
experience at least from countries that

1183
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,299
they recognize what happens with those

1184
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,819
surrendered credentials now some places

1185
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:06,279
will just punch holes through it and and

1186
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:08,079
kick it back to you a lot of places

1187
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:10,210
nowadays though are retaining it they do

1188
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,119
eat they notify the original

1189
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:16,420
jurisdiction electronically and or

1190
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,099
return it if they do return if they

1191
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,009
don't return it they typically will

1192
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:22,599
destroy the original credential and I do

1193
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,489
apologize that there are more questions

1194
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,170
we can talk outside about this we are at

1195
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:29,789
time and I want to thank you all for

1196
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,789
coming and I hope you all enjoy
