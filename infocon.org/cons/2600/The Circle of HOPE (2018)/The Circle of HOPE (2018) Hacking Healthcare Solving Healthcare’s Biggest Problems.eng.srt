1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,150
so thanks everyone it's wonderful to be

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,160
back at hope it's been a few years this

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,450
is kind of an amazing speaking space I

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,130
just want to say if I start acting

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,809
weirdly it's because all I can see are

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,670
the reflections off the metal rims of

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,810
the empty chairs so I assume there are

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,130
people in the room awesome maybe it's

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,799
more comfortable if I assume there's not

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,119
anyway oh now I can see some blue people

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,460
hello so the title of my talk is hacking

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,099
healthcare I just want to start out by

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,140
saying that I have more of a systems

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,379
engineering perspective to healthcare

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,489
I'm a computer scientist by training I'm

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,700
interested in formal verification of

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,709
systems I got into healthcare buys way

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,750
of starting to try to build closed-loop

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,910
systems to take better care of patients

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,250
so when I say hacking healthcare I'm

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,410
thinking of that whole system of health

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,640
care not medical devices particularly

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,169
I'm going to talk a little bit about

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,520
hacking medical devices and where that

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,930
is and in my opinion is not helpful a

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,320
little bit later ok that did not advance

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,320
the slide

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,970
there we go okay so two things really

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,850
got me interested in healthcare and I'm

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,440
hoping my ulterior motive here is to get

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,449
some of you interested and help you to

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,520
get some get you to help solve some of

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,320
these hard problems as well so there's

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
really two phrases that struck me when I

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,339
started to work on medical devices back

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,620
in about 2001 one was this idea of

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,410
evidence-based medicine which is a great

38
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,660
idea the idea is that you do clinical

39
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,820
treatment you treat patients based on

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,679
scientific evidence of how effective

41
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,750
those treatments are for those groups of

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
patients and I think this is a really

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,950
good idea the the question that it begs

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,220
is what in the world we're doctors doing

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,590
before this and and the answer it's kind

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,509
of the same thing that they're doing now

47
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,890
treating based on what they're taught in

48
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,210
medical school and there's an old saying

49
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,860
that half of what you learned in medical

50
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,210
school is wrong you just don't know

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,619
which half so you treat based on what

52
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,089
you learned in school what you see with

53
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,280
the patients that you work with and what

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,600
you hear about and what small fraction

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,310
of the medical literature you as a

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,430
practicing clinician are able to keep up

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,959
with so evidence-based medicine the idea

58
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,360
is that you do scientific studies and

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,310
you see how effective treatments are and

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,780
you change treatment based on that it's

61
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310
really difficult to do for a few reasons

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,190
one of them is that it's very difficult

63
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,510
to collect enough data to do those

64
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,600
studies and I'm going to talk some about

65
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,350
those those challenges the other thing

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,670
that really hooked me on this space is

67
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,799
the idea of preventable medical errors

68
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,970
I've got two pictures up there one is

69
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,620
the 1999 report to err is human in which

70
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,780
the Institute of Medicine reported that

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,070
ninety eight thousand people just in the

72
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,130
United States were dying from

73
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,690
preventable medical errors each year

74
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,920
there's been several studies following

75
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,560
up on that a bunch of reports following

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,329
up on it since 1999 the numbers keep

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,730
doubling kind of each time they do the

78
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,980
report they do another report the second

79
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,510
follow-up said well maybe it's one to

80
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,940
two hundred thousand in the most recent

81
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,220
number and that leads to this headline

82
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,579
of medical errors the third leading

83
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,410
cause of death is 200 to 400 thousand

84
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,130
deaths per year from preventable medical

85
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,750
errors and so I want to dig into what

86
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,638
kind of errors are we talking about what

87
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,019
do we mean by preventable and what could

88
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,670
we do to start preventing them and how

89
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,950
do we build better systems where

90
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,739
it's either harder to make errors or

91
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,190
where we can at least catch document

92
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,610
compensate and similarly to what

93
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,770
Aviation has been able to do and a plane

94
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,050
crash happens investigate the cause and

95
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,000
you try to roll out systems that make

96
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,670
sure that cause doesn't happen again or

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,110
doesn't reach all tin another crash so

98
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,458
how could we build those kind of systems

99
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,680
in healthcare I also wanna introduce the

100
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,830
idea of a wicked problem which being

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,050
from Boston I love this phrase so a

102
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,690
wicked problem is and this is an eye

103
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,190
chart for me to read even here so I

104
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,200
apologize but it's the Wikipedia page

105
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,370
and you can pull it up it's it's a

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,140
problem that's difficult or impossible

107
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,790
to solve because it's tied up and all

108
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,380
sort of cysts all sorts of systemic

109
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,090
issues you can't fix it with a quick

110
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,250
technical fix because there's their

111
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,810
social or workflow problems you can't

112
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,280
really dive into the workflow problems

113
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,680
because you don't have the technical

114
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,168
stuff to help support the solutions and

115
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,269
it's just these kind of tough very

116
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,680
difficult almost intractable problems

117
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,240
and I think those are the kinds of

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,500
problems that we face in healthcare and

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,050
that's why I'm interested to bring this

120
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,120
talk to sort of this audience is that I

121
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,010
think as hackers we're very used to

122
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,979
working in spaces that combine these

123
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,919
kind of social aspects with technical

124
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,539
aspects and trying to affect change in

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,880
very complicated systems that we can

126
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,150
only influence sort of around the edges

127
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,219
or in indirect ways I think hackers

128
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,620
bring that mindset of how do we make a

129
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,900
minimal change in a system that gets it

130
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,130
where we want to go without being able

131
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,539
to say well I'm king of the world and

132
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,540
you all have to do it this way now I

133
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,010
also wanna introduced that the term

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,260
interoperability I started working on

135
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,969
medical devices in 2001 started working

136
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,760
with the medical device plug-and-play

137
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,820
interoperability program and about 2006

138
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,110
and when we started that program my boss

139
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,090
likes to say it was before the iPhone

140
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,450
and people didn't really know what apps

141
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,830
or interoperability meant so what we

142
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,260
mean by interoperability is the ability

143
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,169
to use the devices the existing medical

144
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,360
devices as sensors and actuators and

145
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,070
sort of a control theory sense so we

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,289
want to be able to read data from one

147
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,500
device process that use it to control

148
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,599
another device

149
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,400
and not really care whether our heart

150
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,410
rate comes from a Philips brand monitor

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,060
or a G brand monitor or a pulse oximeter

152
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,260
or an EKG just that we have an accurate

153
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,630
measure of heart rate so some of the

154
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,370
themes I want to get into clinical

155
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,780
spaces are really complicated there's a

156
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,600
lot of actors there's frequently

157
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,429
misaligned incentives what's what the

158
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,160
patient wants may be different than what

159
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,230
the doctor wants to do what the

160
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,970
insurance company wants is a good

161
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,760
outcome from the healthcare system may

162
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,280
not be what the patient's want and there

163
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,360
are increasingly data brokers data

164
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,820
aggregators with their own sets of

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,190
desires consumer and professional are

166
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,510
becoming more blurred we have patients

167
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,700
who are getting more and more acute care

168
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,440
at home things that would have in the

169
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,050
past happened in the hospital patients

170
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,890
on ventilators on infusion pumps getting

171
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,820
dialysis and so on in home spaces

172
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,770
consumer devices are also becoming

173
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,240
increasingly capable you know it's not

174
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,609
just heart rate from a Fitbit now you

175
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,460
have a lot more capable devices doing

176
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,410
much more acute things care is becoming

177
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,549
increasingly automated and I'm going to

178
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,390
try to make the argument that it's

179
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:47,590
really about the data a couple of

180
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,030
pictures sort of set the stage I really

181
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,710
hope to be able to use a laser pointer

182
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,539
but I don't think it's going to work

183
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,950
so on the right we have a rack of

184
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,990
infusion pumps and this is not like a

185
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,849
storage closet these are 12 and fusion

186
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,470
pumps nine syringe and three large

187
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,960
volume that are being used on a single

188
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,450
patient just one caveat these are

189
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,440
pictures from the internet not pictures

190
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,300
of our clinical spaces imagine walking

191
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,280
into a room with those 12 pumps and

192
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,400
saying well the patient's crashing stop

193
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,890
the heparin which pump is it in you know

194
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,359
where's the stop button it's impossible

195
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,380
to build an integrated dashboard for

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,380
these kinds of systems now

197
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,789
along this idea of the blurring of

198
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,739
consumer and clinical worlds I want to

199
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,480
talk a little bit about those different

200
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,130
worlds and what kind of applications we

201
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,840
might want to build so some of the

202
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,340
common things that we try to build to

203
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,270
improve healthcare systems are

204
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,330
documentation both through electronic

205
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,950
healthcare records so EHRs electronic

206
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,419
healthcare records have been a really

207
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,890
big topic a lot of hospitals are

208
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,370
spending a lot of money to install

209
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,840
systems I don't think those systems are

210
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,000
going to be adequate to effect

211
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,969
meaningful change and meaningful patient

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,370
safety improvements I think that the the

213
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,710
EHRs are great for billing which is what

214
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,660
they originally intended for they are

215
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,560
good for some kinds of documentation but

216
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,120
you don't get high enough resolution

217
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,440
data you don't get high enough quality

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,150
data and you don't get the data

219
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,120
provenance that you really need to build

220
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,690
applications to affect meaningful

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,060
patient safety improvements so we've got

222
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,400
documentation we have sort of health and

223
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,590
wellness apps and these are becoming

224
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,219
more and more widespread whether it's

225
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,570
Google Health

226
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,310
Apple Apple health kit etc clinical

227
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,289
decision support applications where it's

228
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,929
taking some measurement some

229
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,218
physiological measurement and some other

230
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,289
kind of measurement you know maybe a

231
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,390
short survey or something and doing some

232
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,218
kind of healthcare health treatment and

233
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,810
then finally physiologic closes of

234
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,130
control which is kind of the most

235
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,630
complicated and that's where you have a

236
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,490
closed loop where you're measuring a

237
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,980
patient's vital sign or something about

238
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,900
the patient blood glucose and using that

239
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,190
to control something that's affecting

240
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,420
the patient's you're measuring blood

241
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,860
glucose and you're controlling an

242
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:04,349
insulin pump we also have different user

243
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,240
communities so these aren't going to

244
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,880
include people using things systems at

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,340
home clinicians researchers but also

246
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,080
also stakeholders like insurance

247
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,050
companies device manufacturers and these

248
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,050
data aggregators that are sort of I

249
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,660
think playing an increasing role these

250
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,819
again are kind of squishy categories

251
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,650
especially when you look at projects

252
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,380
like the open source artificial pancreas

253
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,180
groups that are hacking infusion pumps

254
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,990
with with homebrew control systems

255
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,120
they're kind of medical device

256
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,620
manufacturers but they're also not

257
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,330
regulated as medical device

258
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,830
manufacturers and not building under the

259
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,690
same contact kind of quality system as

260
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,279
medical device manufacturers and they

261
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,640
tend to often be the users of the

262
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,829
systems as well so we run the whole

263
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,319
gamut from you know health and fitness

264
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:55,920
kind of applications weight loss dealing

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,930
with chronic conditions in healthcare

266
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,189
spaces we're dealing more with patients

267
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,199
bringing their own devices that are

268
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,240
bringing their own data in and trying to

269
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
integrate that into displays if we have

270
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,940
blood pressure measurements from a

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,350
patient's visits to the to the hospital

272
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,730
but then we also have blood pressure

273
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,380
measurements they're taking at home

274
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,910
should we put those together in one

275
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,290
dashboard even though we know the

276
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,819
hospital ones are taken with high

277
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,680
quality calibrated equipment and the

278
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,940
home home ones are taken with you know

279
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,719
whatever the cheapest blood pressure

280
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,310
cuff at CVS was we're we're currently

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,260
trying to solve these kinds of things in

282
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,790
hospitals and finally we have

283
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,680
researchers that might be doing a

284
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,480
clinical study and providing devices to

285
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,550
patients or might be just aggregating

286
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,050
data from that that patients are

287
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,189
volunteering in that other category I

288
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:46,849
want to talk a little bit about data

289
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:49,380
aggregators is I think that these are

290
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,740
becoming increasingly important from a

291
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,439
privacy and security perspective and I

292
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,820
would include they're not just the

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,959
companies that are manufacturing the

294
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,490
home measurement devices

295
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,079
you know the manufacturers of what

296
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,839
glucose meters of course have the blood

297
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,729
glucose data and will question that of

298
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,810
course a little bit on that in a next

299
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,180
slide the but we also have places like

300
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,800
Google or Apple or you know wherever you

301
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,569
bought your phone from that have

302
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,240
increasing amounts of data that is

303
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,040
relevant to health especially when we

304
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,399
start looking at the identification or

305
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,449
re identification of health data if

306
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,180
Google has your location information

307
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:29,010
then they may be able to re identify a

308
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,719
data set that's released by a hospital

309
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,420
even if that data set doesn't include

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,420
any of the HIPAA protected data elements

311
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,170
one of the things that we run into a lot

312
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,810
in trying to build better health systems

313
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,490
is this idea of scaling or of

314
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:49,079
integrating data from

315
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,030
for multiple systems so typical internet

316
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,950
of things or home wellness devices your

317
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,770
fitbit's your Omron blood pressure cuff

318
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,990
from CVS your glucose meter your weight

319
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,490
scale

320
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,470
I'll follow a similar kind of pattern

321
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,810
you've have the device it has some kind

322
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,060
of link often bluetooth to an app app on

323
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,250
a phone that phone app then connects to

324
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,660
the manufacturer's server you can go to

325
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,340
their website login with your

326
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,260
credentials and see you know a nice

327
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,780
little graph or maybe it maybe download

328
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,760
a copy of your data but there's

329
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,280
typically not an API to communicate

330
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,900
directly with the devices and then it's

331
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,050
very rare at this point for there even

332
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,329
to be an app to query the database in

333
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,560
the manufacturers cloud so when we try

334
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,050
to build an application that integrates

335
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,569
data from multiple devices that's very

336
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,209
hard and Apple and Google both have

337
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,460
projects where they're trying to build

338
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,590
fitness or health apps that are able to

339
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,470
connect to these devices but that's

340
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,270
really by virtue of their size and

341
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,600
weight giving them more leverage with

342
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:51,060
the device manufacturers to get api's to

343
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,010
get connections in ways that you know

344
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,010
people who aren't that big don't have

345
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,390
okay so we see some common kind of

346
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,630
patterns with integration and this gets

347
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:08,160
to why it's difficult to gather data why

348
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,050
it's difficult to do these kind of

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,280
clinical trials to support

350
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:16,260
evidence-based medicine so on the top

351
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,230
left I'm going to try this I can't

352
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,540
resist it sort of works over here we

353
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,250
have this idea that we have an app that

354
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,630
needs data from a few different devices

355
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,070
maybe it's going to pull data from this

356
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,689
patient monitor and from this kavanah

357
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,210
graph and use it to control a ventilator

358
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,440
and a typical application or typical

359
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,630
place you might want to do that is

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,690
weaning a patient off of a ventilator

361
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,490
and an ICU patients are on a ventilator

362
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,140
in the ICU maybe for several days at

363
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,680
some point they're getting ready to come

364
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,060
off the ventilator and you go through a

365
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,280
reasonably standardized algorithmic

366
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,229
process to take them off the ventilator

367
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,030
of decreasing some of the settings

368
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,700
trying to see how they do without as

369
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,730
much support and eventually completely

370
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,120
taking them off the vent

371
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,530
and if you're a clinician doing that you

372
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,020
can maybe go into the room and check

373
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:05,380
once an hour once every 15 minutes if

374
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,699
you're really fast if we have an

375
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,300
algorithm doing that of course we can

376
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,100
check many times a minute you know so we

377
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,349
think that we can do better patient care

378
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,230
with these kinds of algorithms even than

379
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,490
a very attentive clinician can once we

380
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:25,240
once we're able to integrate the data

381
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,950
another kind of architecture is this

382
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,200
sort of cloud one that I alluded to with

383
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,550
the home-based devices where we have a

384
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,520
blood pressure cuff that talks to the

385
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,400
cloud that talks to a app that the

386
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,140
patient's able to run third architecture

387
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,000
the pattern that's very common in

388
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,680
hospitals is we have a fleet of devices

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,390
from one manufacturer here we have a

390
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,250
bunch of infusion pumps and they

391
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,750
communicate with that manufacturers

392
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,850
server which is installed in the

393
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,470
hospital's data center somewhere so if

394
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,000
you want data from any of these devices

395
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,130
the only way to get it is to go through

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,510
that manufacturers server their API and

397
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,320
you get the data that they've chosen to

398
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,510
provide last architecture that I want to

399
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,000
point to is something that's sort of

400
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,550
becoming more common in home fitness dig

401
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,500
into that a little bit in the next slide

402
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,209
where you have an application that's

403
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,740
running locally that communicates with a

404
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,720
bunch of devices and then communicates

405
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,590
out with a larger application in the

406
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,030
cloud and this is the pattern that that

407
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,230
are in our research group we've sort of

408
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,819
followed with trying to implement a

409
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,950
architecture for healthcare data

410
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,620
integration and I'll talk some more

411
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,240
about that project in a second but that

412
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,100
architecture is you have a bunch of

413
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,780
sensors locally here we've got somebody

414
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,520
on an exercise bike and they have heart

415
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,100
rate sensors respiratory function

416
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,060
sensors blood glucose blood lactate you

417
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:47,020
know home fitness enthusiasts freaks

418
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:50,310
whatever are setting up their basements

419
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,900
and you know myself I have to admit

420
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,030
included setting up basements with more

421
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,890
stuff than is in like a physiologic lab

422
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,959
from a few years ago we're really able

423
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:02,170
to measure and monitor to a much higher

424
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,720
degree than was previous possible even

425
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,969
in professional settings and the

426
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,519
equipment is becoming more

427
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,970
more inexpensive some of the reasons to

428
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,769
do this are applications like his

429
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,230
whiffed where you have multiplayer

430
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,540
online environments where you've got

431
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,259
several thousand people in their

432
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,910
basements all around the world

433
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,589
collaborating and competing in a virtual

434
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,000
environment so you're on in your

435
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:30,009
basement peddling on your bike you see

436
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,779
an avatar of the bike and you see

437
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,910
everyone else's avatars and you can race

438
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,569
online and the more equipment you have

439
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,969
them work

440
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:39,128
Vital Signs you connect sort of the more

441
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:43,689
immersive it is the more data you see

442
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:45,670
back so these home fitness things are

443
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:46,959
not just you know your weight scale your

444
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,670
blood pressure cuff but are starting to

445
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,469
get much more advanced we even have a

446
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,870
physiologic closed-loop control here

447
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,129
where we're measuring heartrate some of

448
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,230
the other vital signs and using that to

449
00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:03,100
control resistance of the trainer and so

450
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:05,860
on as we move more into acute care

451
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,069
spaces in the hospital i tried to map

452
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,379
out sort of just the space of what kind

453
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,658
of applications we want to have and i

454
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,939
think there are two important axes here

455
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,520
two most important are what's the time

456
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,470
scale of the loop that you're trying to

457
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,030
close with these the other is how

458
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,120
critical is this and so we go from an

459
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,039
optional kind of application like home

460
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,289
fitness if it if it doesn't work that

461
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,210
day you're not going to die weight

462
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,379
management if it doesn't on the on the

463
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,630
other end of the time scale weight

464
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,190
management is one of these where again

465
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,820
if it doesn't work you're not going to

466
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,770
die up to life critical so IABP is an

467
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,658
intra-aortic balloon pump there you have

468
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,960
you're measuring electrical activity

469
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:49,360
from a malfunctioning essentially heart

470
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,669
you're using that electrical activity to

471
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,928
coordinate inflation of a balloon that's

472
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:57,490
inside the heart or in the aorta and the

473
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,500
timing has to be synchronized within a

474
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,090
few milliseconds so that the inflation

475
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,309
of the balloon supports the heart that's

476
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,080
trying to beat if it doesn't quite sink

477
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,450
up then you actually interfere with that

478
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,549
heartbeat reduce the amount of blood

479
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,830
flow to the heart muscle itself and you

480
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:13,780
can lose blood you can lose more heart

481
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,580
muscle very very quickly and so

482
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,918
synchronizing within a few milliseconds

483
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,270
is really critical there so that goes up

484
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,700
at the sort of extreme of

485
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,040
very fast controlled a very life

486
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,100
critical some of the other ones up there

487
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,210
are defibrillator synchronization

488
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,139
infusion interlocks we'll talk a little

489
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,060
bit more about and alarm systems things

490
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,210
over on this end our automated

491
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,210
ventilator weaning that I mentioned it

492
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,470
happens over a period of sort of hours

493
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,120
to days and if it doesn't work that time

494
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,520
we can go back you can do a manual

495
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,590
process you can try again medication

496
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,210
reminders they're important they're

497
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,220
going to help people stay alive long

498
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,260
term but if you miss a day it's probably

499
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,550
not that critical and there are other

500
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,890
ways of remembering so as we're trying

501
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,570
to implement these we sort of go back to

502
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,190
those architectures we start looking at

503
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,460
how do we actually build these in a real

504
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,170
Hospital because we can't typically just

505
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,380
connect directly to each of the devices

506
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,760
in a patient room either the devices

507
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,950
don't have that interface the

508
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,110
manufacturers only provide data through

509
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,110
a gateway through a gateway server or

510
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,459
the ports may already be in use that's

511
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,649
something I run into quite commonly

512
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,480
trying to build systems out in hospitals

513
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,950
is well I'd love to connect to the

514
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,700
serial port on this device but it's

515
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,320
already connected to something else so

516
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,600
there's limited connectivity and you run

517
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,720
into those those kinds of limitations so

518
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,310
typical architecture for this is you've

519
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,440
got some medical devices and here's some

520
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,240
patient monitors this patient monitors

521
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,400
on this patient this other one is on

522
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,130
some other patient you'd have you know

523
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,860
maybe up to a few hundred patient

524
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,720
monitors on a single network those all

525
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,320
communicate to a gateway server and that

526
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,850
gateway server then exports some data a

527
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,700
lot of the manufacturers want this

528
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,919
device network to be really dedicated to

529
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,230
their device and they've done all of

530
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,110
their safety analysis they've done all

531
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,340
their testing for FDA certification with

532
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,139
the assumption that there's nothing else

533
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,429
on their network and so if you start

534
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,590
trying to connect other things to the

535
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,440
network like applications for patient

536
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,909
safety you start getting nasty letters

537
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,770
from the manufacturers saying well

538
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,710
you've now messed with our network and

539
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,660
if there's any problems the liability is

540
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,620
all yours

541
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,180
so to avoid those those nasty letters

542
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,510
we like to connect through there through

543
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,500
the manufacturers gateways when possible

544
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,270
that means that the data that we're

545
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,700
getting from the devices is delayed by

546
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,070
many hops the semantics of the data are

547
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,460
often kind of muddled because it goes

548
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,139
through several layers of translation we

549
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,700
would often for instance connect a

550
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,560
ventilator here through the patient

551
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,800
monitor which does some of its own

552
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,550
averaging drops some samples changes

553
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,800
names of some things the gateways often

554
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,260
also only allow a few simultaneous

555
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,800
connections so if we want to know work

556
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,390
it that was in bed hospital if we want

557
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,570
to have a thousand patients connected we

558
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,920
would need a lot of gateway servers but

559
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,770
this is kind of how we have to build

560
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,490
things now to get data from the monitor

561
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,900
into the patient safety application we

562
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,390
have to go through these multiple steps

563
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,180
and I've greatly simplified the steps

564
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,590
here and then to get control back out

565
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,380
from this application to an infusion

566
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:35,659
pump that's going to and infuse a drug

567
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,340
to that patient we then have to do those

568
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,530
steps in Reverse so go through the

569
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,500
gateway server pass that command pass it

570
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,370
to the right device and so you run into

571
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,860
kind of the problems that you would

572
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,510
expect with making sure that you've got

573
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,830
the right device that you're talking to

574
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,370
the device that's actually connected to

575
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:55,879
the patient you want with having the

576
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,830
right credentials and with trying to buy

577
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,440
and procure systems that even support

578
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,300
these kinds of applications I mentioned

579
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,240
that I've simplified this I'm just gonna

580
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,889
flash quickly here's our attempt to draw

581
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,480
out what it actually looked like in one

582
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,370
Hospital and this was to draw that same

583
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,080
system of if we want to have a patient

584
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,850
monitor over here here's here's our

585
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,620
patient on the bed we want to have a

586
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,179
patient monitor here connected to an

587
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,580
infusion pump that's over here somewhere

588
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,860
what steps would that actually have to

589
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,470
go through so you know the silos are

590
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,969
different servers the lines represent

591
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,250
different networks and it all gets

592
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,200
horribly horribly complicated and I

593
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,860
think that we left out most of the

594
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,930
hospitals firewalls most of the

595
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,719
segmentation and the security appliances

596
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:44,870
that are stuck in there as well so it

597
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,280
just the sort of logistical challenges

598
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,639
to building these systems I

599
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,500
I think are quite high we've had some

600
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,660
success in doing it more kind of

601
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,370
constrained or limited circumstances so

602
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,440
like build a system install it in one

603
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,030
room and in that one room we're going to

604
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,700
connect directly to the devices or

605
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,660
connect directly to the server and we've

606
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,720
been able to build some things

607
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:11,600
successfully that way one of the things

608
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,810
that makes engineering and healthcare I

609
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,090
think different from other domains well

610
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,790
one is that there's there's no real

611
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,560
single single system integrator if

612
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,000
you're building an airplane if you're

613
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,050
Boeing or you're Airbus or you're

614
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,790
whoever else builds airplanes these days

615
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,649
you are the single system integrator you

616
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,350
know do you if there's one place that

617
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,540
can do all of the system testing that

618
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,060
can really check that the whole thing

619
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,970
works in healthcare it tends to be the

620
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,919
hospitals and it tends to not be

621
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,150
integrated at one time manufacturers

622
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,490
will come in they'll send therefore

623
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,860
their engineers to install individual

624
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,650
subsystems but there's no one really

625
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,050
looking at that overall larger system of

626
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,020
systems other than potentially the

627
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:59,180
hospital IT or bio med folks who by the

628
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,530
way often are not on great terms with

629
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:07,160
each other probably one of the biggest

630
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,960
fights that I started was saying well

631
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,000
okay we're going around we're trying to

632
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,500
get data off of devices we're sticking

633
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,660
little single board computers on the

634
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,200
back of the devices and and we like to

635
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,880
use beaglebones raspberry PI's also work

636
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,810
we then have to connect Ethernet because

637
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,010
Wireless is it's hard and complicated

638
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,679
Ethernet just simplifies things greatly

639
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,030
so we then have to connect Ethernet we

640
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,920
also have to plug the thing into the

641
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,770
wall somewhere so why not use power over

642
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,900
ethernet and the answer is that well

643
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,139
power over ethernet would mean that it's

644
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,000
coming from the IT department from the

645
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,890
switch in the server closet that the

646
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,900
power to that the thing is coming from

647
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,490
that it's then connecting to a medical

648
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,050
device which has to be tested for

649
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,150
electrical safety by biomedical

650
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,409
engineering and how is the biomedical

651
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,060
engineering department going to do

652
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,570
Electrical Safety testing on the network

653
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,440
switches and

654
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,329
just it wasn't worth struggling through

655
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,779
the layers of bureaucracy honestly we

656
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:05,428
just plugged the thing into the wall

657
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:07,919
another difference between healthcare

658
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:10,559
and other engineering disciplines I

659
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,879
think is that we don't have a good plant

660
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,769
model again if you're building an

661
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:15,570
airplane you have good mathematical

662
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:17,459
models for what it's going to do if you

663
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,499
you know move the flaps all the way one

664
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:21,509
one direction or another and these are

665
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:25,049
all you know parameterised for how fast

666
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,519
is it going how dense is the air etc but

667
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,139
you have a mathematical model for how

668
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,049
the thing is going to behave and that's

669
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:33,359
pretty accurate for patience you really

670
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,369
don't have that we're starting to build

671
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,869
some of those personalized medicine

672
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,689
promises that we'll be able to build

673
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,009
more in the future

674
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,839
machine learning folks are promising

675
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:45,209
that well once we have all the data

676
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,178
we'll be able to generate patient models

677
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:50,309
and what I mean by a patient model is a

678
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,739
model of how a patient's going to react

679
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:56,158
to a treatment so say I have a person

680
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:57,299
and we give them some pain medication

681
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,619
you know they've just had an operation

682
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:03,269
they're in the surgical ICU after a

683
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:04,319
cardiac bypass surgery or something

684
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,239
we're going to give them some pain

685
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,190
medication I want to know if I give them

686
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:10,019
this much morphine or fentanyl

687
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,849
how should I expect their heart rate in

688
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,979
the respiratory rate to change and at

689
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:15,389
what point does the heart rate and

690
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:17,519
respiratory rate indicate that they've

691
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:19,198
had too much you know by the time that

692
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,669
we've given them so much morphine that

693
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:23,159
they stop breathing it's a little late

694
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:25,199
we'd like to detect it before that and

695
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,049
so how do we make a patient model that

696
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:30,899
says well for this patient for this guy

697
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,539
you know for Alice or for Bob how do we

698
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:36,869
know that we've given them enough to

699
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:38,069
control their pain but not so much that

700
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:41,218
we're going to make them stop breathing

701
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:43,349
and often this is done by using patient

702
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:45,659
controlled analgesia and the sort of

703
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:47,009
genius I the idea there is that rather

704
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:50,699
than trying to predict well I'm going to

705
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:52,649
need you know 10 milliliters of morphine

706
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:55,529
and you're going to need 5 liters or

707
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:57,540
whatever sorry I mentioned I'm not a

708
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,820
medical doctor

709
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,010
so rather than trying to figure out how

710
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,710
much people need you you sort of get a

711
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:08,430
baseline of well a good single dose is

712
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,710
this much and if we if we've program a

713
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,990
lockout so you you don't get more than

714
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,700
four doses per hour or whatever you're

715
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,560
probably going to be fine and then give

716
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,760
the person a button to press and you

717
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,260
press the button you get a dose of

718
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,730
medication and and I think most people

719
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,040
at this point of either been in the

720
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,290
hospital and had this or visited someone

721
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,260
and seen it but the idea is you've got a

722
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,270
button to press and when if you want

723
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,220
more medication you press the button if

724
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,840
the pain isn't that bad and the

725
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,240
medication makes you feel nauseous then

726
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,439
don't press the button no until you need

727
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,720
to and this sort of failsafe aspect to

728
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,150
it is that if you've gotten enough

729
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,150
morphine that you fall asleep or are

730
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,000
knocked out you can't press the button

731
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:53,670
so it's failsafe where that breaks down

732
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,370
is if the single dose is so large that

733
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,740
you get an overdose from one or if we

734
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,300
see what we call PCA by proxy where

735
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,880
someone else is pressing the button for

736
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,740
you this is commonly used for folks who

737
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,270
for whatever reason aren't able to

738
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,040
handle pressing the button themselves

739
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,900
maybe because it's a kid maybe because

740
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,159
it's somebody who's just not comfortable

741
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,540
doing it but you end up with a family

742
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,890
member or caregiver pressing the button

743
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,750
for them and potentially tricking and

744
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,760
triggering an overdose so you despite it

745
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,640
being in concept kind of a fail-safe

746
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:28,470
system we still see overdoses way too

747
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,790
often there's a engineer at Baxter when

748
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,130
the infusion pump companies did an

749
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,740
analysis a couple years ago of the FDA's

750
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,630
mod database where they track medical

751
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,550
where they track all kinds of problems

752
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:42,300
with medical devices and found that

753
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:44,820
there's probably a handful of deaths or

754
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,090
serious injuries from PCA overdoses per

755
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,710
day in the US so we're interested in

756
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,300
saying and building these kind of models

757
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,430
and saying well how do we build a better

758
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,710
alarm system how do we detect that a

759
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,470
patient's getting an overdose and then

760
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,590
either just sound an alarm or ideally

761
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,700
stop the infusion pump and the first

762
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:07,320
thing that we need to do is build a

763
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,870
mathematical model of how we expect them

764
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,280
to react to getting this dose and then

765
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,110
start to define some of these phases

766
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,610
where we say well if the vital signs are

767
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,189
in this area then they're kind of safe

768
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,990
if they're in this area then we should

769
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,970
sound an alarm and if they're out here

770
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,770
then patients in serious trouble

771
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,690
and what we want to do is sort of track

772
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,700
the patient's progress through this

773
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,070
state space when it goes when they get

774
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,260
into this alarming area then trigger

775
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,060
quickly but right our model in such a

776
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,530
way that the time that it takes for a

777
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,409
patient for it to go from here

778
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,820
out into critical is long enough that

779
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,670
we're pretty confident that we can get

780
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,040
somebody into the room to fix things and

781
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:47,700
stop at home

782
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:50,220
fortunately humans are slow reaction to

783
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,520
medication typically takes minutes if

784
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,320
not hours and computers are pretty fast

785
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,420
so we can do quite a lot in the time

786
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,399
that it takes for somebody to react to a

787
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,670
medication and we can catch things

788
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,980
pretty early what we're missing to do

789
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,540
this sort of at scale is really the

790
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,020
large data sets gathered for many

791
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,389
patients overdoses happen like I said a

792
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,610
handful of times a day but there are

793
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,280
tens of thousands of infusions per day

794
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:20,550
most of which aren't documented and any

795
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,470
kind of automated or detailed way so

796
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,600
building a data set of what it looks

797
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,930
like when somebody gets an overdose is

798
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,780
really hard and that's true for not just

799
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,070
for that PCA use case but for most use

800
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,730
cases where there's where there's a

801
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,470
medical error or an accident or an

802
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:41,820
unexpected reaction to treatment these

803
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,450
really take either very large clinical

804
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:50,100
studies or automating data capture and

805
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:51,810
recording kind of for everyone so the

806
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,649
solution that I've been involved in

807
00:30:51,810 --> 00:31:01,950
trying to build it's called open ice ice

808
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:04,230
is the ASTM 2760 109 standard rese rear

809
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,030
a defied in 2013 and back up again this

810
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,880
year happens every four or five years

811
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,740
and open ice is our implementation of

812
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,320
that ice they're standing for the

813
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,710
integrated clinical environment not

814
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:21,659
either William Gibson's ice or the the

815
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:24,000
the the ice that we all love and will

816
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,770
hopefully not have to love for too much

817
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,860
longer anyway

818
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:34,860
staying out of politics mostly the what

819
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,139
ice includes in the the architecture

820
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,800
here is it's actually pretty similar to

821
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,600
that cycling that zipped kind of

822
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,669
architecture we do some local control

823
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,129
and then we also talk to external

824
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,140
systems to pull in lab data vital signs

825
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,660
records communicate stuff back to the

826
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,930
medical record system so our local

827
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,150
control happens through well just step

828
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,950
through we've got a patient here on the

829
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,050
bottom we've got the caretaker caregiver

830
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,490
on the top so from that you can surmise

831
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,560
that this was mostly written by

832
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:09,720
clinicians and not by patient advocates

833
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,190
but which is a slightly serious comment

834
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,740
because I'm involved in a lot of these

835
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:16,800
standards and we tend to have mostly

836
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,740
folks from device manufacturers involved

837
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,520
in writing medical standards and medical

838
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,080
IT standards maybe a few clinicians and

839
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,460
almost no patient advocates know if

840
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,879
you're interested in getting involved

841
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,340
please do so we've got our patient or

842
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,400
caregiver we have a nice supervisor

843
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,840
which runs the application or a set of

844
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,780
applications you may run many

845
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,120
simultaneously we have a network we have

846
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,950
a set of adapters two devices we might

847
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,989
have a device that speaks directly that

848
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:49,050
that that uses our interoperable

849
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,150
protocol and speaks directly and then

850
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:53,580
we've got a data logger hung up here and

851
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,320
the data logger I think is pretty

852
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,780
critical the idea is similar to a

853
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,929
blackbox recorder on an airplane we want

854
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,790
to have a independent in the sense that

855
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,340
it's not tied to any single device or

856
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,260
device manufacturer and standards based

857
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,570
and that the data should be written in a

858
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,450
common terminology record of what

859
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,360
happens to a patient and recording that

860
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,090
by recording the electronic outputs of

861
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,889
the various devices and having a record

862
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,139
of what commands get set to what devices

863
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,750
it's really really common when there's a

864
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,910
problem with a medical device or a

865
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,070
system to see the various vendors who

866
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,870
are

867
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,720
involved just all point fingers at each

868
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,070
other and it takes years to clean up

869
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,200
I've seen this with infusion pump

870
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,879
systems where you know half of the

871
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,380
infusion pumps are connecting to their

872
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,179
server and database the other half

873
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,740
aren't showing up at all and it turns

874
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:43,389
into a multi-year fight between the

875
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,120
vendor who sold the wireless system and

876
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:51,158
the vendor for the pumps and the company

877
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,508
that did all the installation so we want

878
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,740
the data logger so that we have a

879
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:58,899
independent record we can well if I'm

880
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,220
talking to the manufacturer as I say so

881
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:03,939
that we can prove that you didn't that

882
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,370
it's not your fault to the clinicians

883
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:10,300
it's more to you know identify what

884
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:12,190
happened it's not uncommon now if

885
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,250
someone you know passes away in the

886
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,960
hospital you make someone may go into

887
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,889
the room and find that they've they've

888
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,780
passed their dead in their bed and what

889
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,760
happened well you sort of surmise from

890
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,310
the medical record if they were you know

891
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,899
if it's not an unexpected occurrence you

892
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,509
assume that what you expected to happen

893
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:33,279
happened if it is unexpected then you

894
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,929
can try to quarantine the devices you

895
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,030
can try to grab all of the medical

896
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:40,149
devices before they get reassigned to

897
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,679
another patient and wiped and there are

898
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,299
you know quality improvement and

899
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,829
essentially forensics groups and most

900
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,220
hospitals that will try to dig through

901
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:50,050
and figure out what actually happened

902
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,549
but there's no standardized data format

903
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,919
within the device there's no standards

904
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,030
for how they log data and so it can be

905
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,469
very difficult and very very

906
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,530
time-consuming to go through and try to

907
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,839
coordinate these logs the devices in

908
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,780
most hospitals aren't time-synchronized

909
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,490
even we did a study a few years back

910
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,900
where we flew a biomedical engineer

911
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,259
around to five different hospitals

912
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,800
recorded the clock time on it was about

913
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,380
2,000 medical devices and tried to see

914
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,300
how far off they were my favorite device

915
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:25,599
was thought it was January 1st 1970

916
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,240
for but it was really really common to

917
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,930
see devices that were 15 minutes to a

918
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,020
few hours off if you regard accurate as

919
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,700
within five seconds than four or five

920
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,589
percent of the devices were accurate and

921
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,839
so this makes it really hard to

922
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:42,670
determine even basic causality you know

923
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,560
did the did the patient's heart rate go

924
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,430
up after they got the antibiotic and

925
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
maybe they were allergic to the

926
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,430
antibiotic or did their heart rate go up

927
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,740
and then later they got the antibiotic

928
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,690
and it's unrelated it makes it really

929
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,399
hard to go through and do any kind of

930
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,869
root cause analysis if you can't trust

931
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,869
the clocks on the individual devices

932
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,160
okay so our our architect our

933
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,379
implementation basically follows that

934
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,060
architecture the picture is is a build

935
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:12,369
in our lab or our old lab the

936
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,560
architecture looks kind of like this we

937
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,790
we tend to connect to individual medical

938
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,160
devices using something like a

939
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,170
BeagleBone beaglebones

940
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,149
for a couple of reasons one is we can

941
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,140
plug a serial port right into it in a

942
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,750
way that's a little more complicated

943
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,328
with like a raspberry pi also

944
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,520
beaglebones we were able through one

945
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:32,829
supplier to get this to get a huge

946
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,069
number of these really anonymous looking

947
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:37,839
black metal boxes and if it's in an

948
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,099
anonymous looking black metal box and we

949
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,200
stick it on the back of a medical device

950
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,990
then nobody looks at it twice if it's a

951
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,060
Raspberry Pi and it's in a clear acrylic

952
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,859
case and you can see all the blinking

953
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,270
lights then people want to know what it

954
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:50,920
is and they ask questions about it so

955
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,839
the beaglebones have worked out well for

956
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,339
us we also got some in orange boxes that

957
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,930
we use for the data logger so that it

958
00:36:54,339 --> 00:37:00,609
looked more like aircraft black box but

959
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:06,129
the anonymous black box is a great deal

960
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:08,440
of power so we use those to translate

961
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,440
from the proprietary serial mostly

962
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,300
serial protocols of the devices there's

963
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,420
both a proprietary data communications

964
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,859
protocol and then usually a proprietary

965
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,800
data representation they have their own

966
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:22,690
terminology set and we try to map that

967
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,040
to a common way of moving the data

968
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,680
around we tend to use a

969
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,509
publish/subscribe middleware we like DDS

970
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,009
for this implementation I'm happy to

971
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,490
dive into more detail about why we

972
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,020
picked it or what the advantage of

973
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:37,359
disadvantages are but our current

974
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,360
implementation that's on github uses DDS

975
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,740
we use that bus to share data around and

976
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,720
we hang an applic hang applications off

977
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:48,560
of there so a device says hey I've got

978
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,450
heart rate data for Bob the application

979
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
says I want bob's heart rate data in the

980
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,250
middle where it takes care of matching

981
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,259
those up we also have some data export

982
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,140
that we do through node we have some

983
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:03,830
data recording that we built a few years

984
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,868
ago and so of course we use Mongo and we

985
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,480
connect to external networks that we can

986
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:12,290
export data as well

987
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,480
I had a placeholder for an open eyes

988
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,540
demo which I'm not going to do both for

989
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,100
sort of lack of time but also because

990
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,850
when I tested it before I plug my laptop

991
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:26,118
and it wasn't working so sorry for that

992
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:29,240
you can go to our website open eyes INF

993
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,780
o open eyes dot-com and org or hockey

994
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,839
sites

995
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,200
I think dotnet is as well so we got that

996
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,609
info and if you download the code and

997
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,710
run it you see something like this so

998
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,390
this is our ice supervisor we have a set

999
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,280
of connected devices we have a set of

1000
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,770
applications we can run that include

1001
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,690
some data visualization because data

1002
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,480
visualization ends up being really

1003
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,770
really hard to do in a hospital because

1004
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,230
you can't get the data from the devices

1005
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,640
and put it all in one place and so it

1006
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,950
ends up being very difficult very

1007
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,900
complicated and when you can get all the

1008
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,310
data from the devices it's often so old

1009
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,619
that you can't really do a real-time

1010
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,320
dashboard so we built this as a way of

1011
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:10,369
illustrating what we could do if we had

1012
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,810
high speed high fidelity standardized

1013
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,070
data from the devices what kind of

1014
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,350
applications can you build and so

1015
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,180
there's examples of Auto validation

1016
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,460
where we can push data into a healthcare

1017
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,200
record and automatically validate it by

1018
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,910
correlating either multiple sources of

1019
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,890
the same data or using more advanced

1020
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:28,359
kind of algorithms say yes this looks

1021
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:31,940
real or no this is not real there is a

1022
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:34,310
problem with medical data where a lot of

1023
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,109
it is really really noisy and a lot of

1024
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,820
it ends up being inaccurate so you have

1025
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:39,619
data from pulse oximeters that go on a

1026
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,260
fingertip and you get a heart rate you

1027
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:43,040
get a blood set blood oxygen saturation

1028
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,430
number from that

1029
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,720
but if you're squeezing a phone if

1030
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,220
you're pushing your arm up on the

1031
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,290
bedrail if you have a blood pressure

1032
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,080
cuff inflating on that arm if you're

1033
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:57,140
talking on the phone and agitated you

1034
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,520
can start to see just wrong numbers out

1035
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,259
of these things they that's one of their

1036
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,790
failure modes most of the devices have

1037
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,220
similar kind of failure modes where in

1038
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:07,640
everyday practice you commonly see

1039
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,490
either erroneous data or drops of data

1040
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,950
and so this gives us a platform where we

1041
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:15,069
can sort of compare multiple sources if

1042
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:18,259
we have multiple devices connected and

1043
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,580
filter out some of that that erroneous

1044
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,010
data is one of the things that's really

1045
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,490
led to a problem and false positive

1046
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:27,770
alarms in hospitals and by false

1047
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,720
positive I don't mean that the device

1048
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,970
shouldn't be alarming it sees something

1049
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,009
that that the manufacturer has

1050
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,080
identified as a reason to alarm you know

1051
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,010
maybe the finger clip has fallen off and

1052
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,900
you're not getting a heart rate

1053
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,940
measurement at all and as far as that

1054
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,680
device knows the patient's heart might

1055
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,090
have just stopped and it should scream

1056
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,569
as loudly as I can and get a clinician

1057
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,430
to run it but the effect of deploying

1058
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,140
that at scale is that you've got a bunch

1059
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,029
of pulse oximeters in the hospital that

1060
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,460
are screaming all the time and you get

1061
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,590
nurses having alarm fatigue where they

1062
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,060
can't respond to all of these or they

1063
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,550
can respond to them but they spend a

1064
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,410
huge amount of the time doing so and it

1065
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,230
really takes time away that they could

1066
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,270
be spending on patient care so I think

1067
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,950
better alarm systems are one of the

1068
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,050
first areas that we really need to

1069
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,490
address and that's something that we've

1070
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:22,250
tried to build and prototype through

1071
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:23,950
this system go back slightly this is

1072
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:28,550
cool but I'm gonna skip it

1073
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:30,379
sorry so one of the one of the sort of

1074
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:33,410
key questions we run into is we start

1075
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,630
talking about data aggregation data

1076
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:39,339
collection whether it's to feed smarter

1077
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:42,470
alarm systems or for machine learning or

1078
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:45,260
for you know other kind of data

1079
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,149
analytics is can we can we even combine

1080
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,730
device data so I've drawn three

1081
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,290
different patient monitors and and and

1082
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,660
we've got three devices there we have

1083
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:56,190
three slightly different definitions of

1084
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,810
vital signs each manufacturer gets

1085
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,430
to decide what they mean by heart rate

1086
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,690
and maybe they're measuring it from a

1087
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,509
different part of the heart rate wave

1088
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,859
from both the EKG waveform maybe they're

1089
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,480
averaging it over a different time

1090
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,400
period maybe they're processing it in

1091
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,690
different ways and they probably are

1092
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,780
doing very different things when the

1093
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:15,089
signal is very noisy and so you can end

1094
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,800
up with with different definitions of

1095
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:20,220
these vital signs even for something as

1096
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,470
seemingly basic as heart rate and so one

1097
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,779
of the sort of key questions I have is

1098
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,700
as we start to aggregate data and try to

1099
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,670
do machine learning on it try to use

1100
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,470
those data sets to diagnose patients are

1101
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,450
we going to be diagnosing real things in

1102
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,950
real patients or are we just identifying

1103
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,779
with different ways that the device is

1104
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:40,560
signal processing algorithms have sort

1105
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,329
of colored or shifted the data so how do

1106
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,089
so how do we make datasets that are

1107
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:47,369
meaningful and useful either for machine

1108
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:52,759
learning or for you know manual analysis

1109
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:55,349
or other kinds of algorithms one of the

1110
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,810
sort of key things for medical devices

1111
00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:00,720
its intended use and this is a sort of a

1112
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,520
technical term of art to FDA that the

1113
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,040
manufacturer gets to specify what the

1114
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,300
device is for so an infusion pump is for

1115
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,319
pushing a medication into a patient a

1116
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,760
monitoring devices for measuring a

1117
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,440
particular vital sign and there and if

1118
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,740
they're defined for a patient population

1119
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,720
a particular place and a particular use

1120
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,950
and what we really one of the things

1121
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,720
that we really need is for device

1122
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,939
manufacturers to build devices that are

1123
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,160
intended to send data to other systems

1124
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,540
we've seen some movement from FDA in the

1125
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,529
last couple of years on this there

1126
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,630
there's a new guidance on

1127
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,329
interoperability that says that this is

1128
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,589
a good idea and emotion to it it's a

1129
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:39,810
first step but the difference between a

1130
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:42,270
clinical grade device you're Massimo nel

1131
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,940
cuore pulse oximeter and and a cheapo

1132
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:47,520
that you bought off of you know Alibaba

1133
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,770
or wherever is the metadata you know

1134
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,560
it's the accuracy it's that's how much

1135
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,170
how trustworthy is this data and if we

1136
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,460
can start to annotate device data with

1137
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,470
that metadata with a little bit more

1138
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,700
provenance information then applications

1139
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,230
can choose whether or not to use that

1140
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,230
data based on that metadata

1141
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,799
I just want to mention really quickly

1142
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,150
patient privacy and informed consent

1143
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,880
there's this idea of informed consent

1144
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,850
but if a patient is agreeing to allow

1145
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,200
their data to be used they should

1146
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,850
understand those uses and understand

1147
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,490
where the data is going and who's going

1148
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,480
to use it as those uses become more

1149
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,509
complicated this is

1150
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,160
I think gotten a lot harder and so I

1151
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,810
would just say one of the big open

1152
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,160
questions is how do we explain to data

1153
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,870
how there's how do we explain to

1154
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,299
patients how their data will be used and

1155
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:38,290
how do we obtain tract and I think

1156
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,790
retract permission I don't have answers

1157
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,830
for this if it's something we've been

1158
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,970
exploring and be really interested to

1159
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,600
talk with folks who are working in that

1160
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:48,730
area there are a lot of security

1161
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,680
challenges around the device interfaces

1162
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:54,100
and individual devices and alert around

1163
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,779
these larger systems I would point one

1164
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,640
of the critical ones I think is this

1165
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,500
idea of time management and time stamps

1166
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:05,049
if you can't trust the time and the data

1167
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:09,130
then it's almost useless I also include

1168
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:10,540
patient consent and under that when we

1169
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:15,370
start looking at large-scale patient

1170
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:16,930
data sharing especially authentication

1171
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,400
and authorization of devices when we

1172
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,310
connect a device to the network we'd

1173
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,450
like to know where did that device come

1174
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,880
from is it supposed to be in the

1175
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,850
hospital a key thing that we need for

1176
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,310
that is a unique device identifier and

1177
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:32,529
FDA has been pushing Udi's for devices

1178
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,810
for a number of years they've been

1179
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,910
pushing it as a labeling thing so your

1180
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,940
box of box of tongue depressors will

1181
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,589
have a machine-readable barcode that

1182
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,470
identifies the manufacturer and that's

1183
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:46,540
great and we need that but when I talk

1184
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,279
about electronic UDI I don't just want a

1185
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,020
machine readable barcode I want the

1186
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,490
device on its serial port around its

1187
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,700
Ethernet port to spit out something

1188
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:58,689
that's ultimately traceable MAC address

1189
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:00,580
koumei gets you so far and then testing

1190
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,250
verification certification of devices

1191
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,650
talk a little bit more about that

1192
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:08,710
particularly around patching devices are

1193
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,560
patched all the time or at least should

1194
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,180
be patched all the time one of the

1195
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,740
problems is that installing patches may

1196
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,540
break other things and different

1197
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,270
hospitals and think of all of this has

1198
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,920
been pub

1199
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,080
pretty widely but but for instance

1200
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,950
patching your Cisco router may break

1201
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,900
something in a medical application so

1202
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,879
how do we ensure that the patch is a

1203
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,800
cure when you install a patch that it

1204
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,080
actually fixes what it's supposed to but

1205
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,340
then also that the complex system is

1206
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,950
going to keep working when you patch

1207
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,620
that one piece without either taking too

1208
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:42,020
long because patching can be a quite

1209
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,299
lengthy process you know I've heard one

1210
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,360
lately where it took half an hour to an

1211
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:49,070
hour to patch a Central Station it's the

1212
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,040
computer that sits in the middle of the

1213
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:53,390
nursing station on a floor and shows all

1214
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,640
the vital signs from all the patients

1215
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,680
and it's really not acceptable to take

1216
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,350
it down for an hour you know once every

1217
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,640
couple months to patch it so how do we

1218
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:05,900
do this without it taking too long

1219
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,190
costing too much I've also heard a lot

1220
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,230
about the security from device

1221
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,790
manufacturers in ways that kind of makes

1222
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,890
me nervous

1223
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,230
one of the there tend to be two

1224
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:18,379
reactions from manufacturers to security

1225
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,030
concerns one is to say that well the

1226
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,830
only secure device is one that you never

1227
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,110
take out of the box or that is never

1228
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,120
connected to a network I think that's

1229
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:28,550
one of the first pages of the orange

1230
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:32,839
book shows like a computer in a vault

1231
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:34,340
that's that model the other is that well

1232
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,530
we're going to encrypt everything so

1233
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:41,060
that only our devices can read the data

1234
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:42,710
and my response is that preventable

1235
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,420
medical errors kill a lot of people

1236
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,390
already and that a lot of these

1237
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,660
preventable or even unpreventable errors

1238
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:52,490
are treatable or fixable if you have

1239
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,410
better connectivity if you have the

1240
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,049
ability to build these applications if

1241
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,940
you have adequate excuse me accurate

1242
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,670
time synchronized data the ability to

1243
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,830
build these better apps and that we need

1244
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,050
open standards-based interfaces

1245
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,850
not proprietary encryption that means

1246
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,710
that only GE can read data on a GE

1247
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:11,600
network and that turning off the

1248
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:19,220
communications will actually kill a lot

1249
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:20,540
of patients okay so what do we want what

1250
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,520
I would like is better patient

1251
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,070
monitoring ability to build smart alarm

1252
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,560
systems to deploy algorithms and

1253
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,329
analytics more widely and what we're

1254
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,609
really fighting against is

1255
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:34,789
to some extent existing workflows where

1256
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:37,369
it can be very difficult to change how

1257
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:38,599
clinicians do things often because the

1258
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,150
way that they've done things has been

1259
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,940
optimized over a very long period of

1260
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,150
time to avoid killing people ultimately

1261
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,309
you know they they say well we tried it

1262
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,920
this way and these bad things happened

1263
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:53,779
so we changed it so those bad things no

1264
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,489
longer happened and then you iterate a

1265
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:57,109
few times so you keep changing the

1266
00:48:55,489 --> 00:48:58,640
process bad things keep happening you

1267
00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:00,288
keep changing it slightly to avoid that

1268
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,819
bad thing then it gets to a point where

1269
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:03,170
bad things don't happen too much and

1270
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:05,839
you're afraid to change it because you

1271
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,239
don't want to go back to any of the any

1272
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,729
of the things that we're happening and

1273
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,219
the problem is that you you end up sort

1274
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:14,509
of backed into a local Maxima where if

1275
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:17,059
you could change everything you could

1276
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:18,529
you could really improve safety but

1277
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:22,359
you're kind of stuck and it's very

1278
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:24,799
difficult to to change things too much

1279
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,109
we see clinical spaces with a lot of

1280
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,579
actors sometime with sometimes with

1281
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:31,430
misaligned incentives you know the

1282
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:32,959
device manufacturer that who wants their

1283
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,609
system to be vertically integrated

1284
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:36,049
because then they can sell more devices

1285
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:38,299
they've got more lock-in from their

1286
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:43,339
customers they made they make more

1287
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:44,900
profits ultimately we see consumer and

1288
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,849
professional spaces getting more blurred

1289
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,829
acute care devices things that were only

1290
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,959
used in hospitals being reused more at

1291
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:52,789
home home devices coming into hospitals

1292
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:56,448
and we're seeing more automation of care

1293
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:58,999
and in my opinion to really radically

1294
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:01,279
improve these systems we need we

1295
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,959
desperately need more data from the

1296
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:04,789
devices we need more data about patients

1297
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:06,919
and we need better systems that allow us

1298
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:09,680
to track what's happening and really

1299
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,920
realize those promises of evidence-based

1300
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:18,308
medicine okay but I think we've got a

1301
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,309
few minutes left for questions Thanks

1302
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:29,310
do I will mention I can't see anything

1303
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:31,230
so if you got to ask the question so far

1304
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:34,200
I'm the only person lined up and I have

1305
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:37,260
several small questions how many how

1306
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,299
often do you see a reasonable patch

1307
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,550
infrastructure's for applying patches

1308
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,680
with signed cryptographically signed

1309
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:48,330
updates by the manufacturer with key

1310
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,160
material in the device sometimes some we

1311
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,900
actually do know seriously what we

1312
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,730
actually do from some manufacturers it's

1313
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,000
not a requirement by manufacturer and

1314
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:59,070
I'd say that I think five years ago that

1315
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,930
was really rare maybe you've got a disc

1316
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,210
in the mail from a manufacturer and it's

1317
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,640
becoming much more common and similarly

1318
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,980
how often do you see backdoors for

1319
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,379
installers or engineers that are

1320
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,930
documented you know with default or

1321
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,150
unchangeable passwords in these devices

1322
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,940
well I don't think the manufacturers

1323
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:23,070
like to call them back doors yeah but I

1324
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:25,050
don't I I bought a system for our lab

1325
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,490
once and really wanted to install and

1326
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,020
use it and ended up having to do all the

1327
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:30,810
installation and configuration myself

1328
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,880
despite spending five figures on support

1329
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,520
to do exactly that because I refused to

1330
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,930
install the the extra router switch and

1331
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,790
connection to the Internet that they

1332
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:41,609
demand it to let their engineers law

1333
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:45,300
again we are having more success with

1334
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:47,880
manufacturers and forcing them to log in

1335
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:52,859
through systems that let us track the

1336
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:56,070
individual who's logging in and in

1337
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:57,840
separating out having more segments and

1338
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,830
networks and really trying to separate

1339
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,650
out those backdoors

1340
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:03,690
but ultimately I think that there are

1341
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,910
like compelling reasons to allow a

1342
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,640
manufacturer to remote into a system in

1343
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:11,160
some cases not usually into the bedside

1344
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,618
devices it said probably not ever into

1345
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,480
the bedside devices but into the data

1346
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:20,250
aggregation systems into the gateways

1347
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:25,920
into the sort of management systems hi

1348
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:29,369
so in regards to security which type or

1349
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,740
which type of security do you see more

1350
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:33,630
of a concern with like is it more of the

1351
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,808
real-time systems or is it more of the

1352
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,909
patient data that would be

1353
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:38,469
a bigger concern from a security

1354
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:40,799
perspective and where you've seen

1355
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:43,509
security vulnerabilities in particular

1356
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:46,779
so I will mention I don't work so much

1357
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:48,369
on day-to-day operations so right with

1358
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:50,349
that perspective

1359
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:51,640
my concern is much more on the patient

1360
00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:53,229
data frankly at this point I think

1361
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,129
that's the piece that we're seeing that

1362
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:59,618
has the most value to you know malicious

1363
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,789
folks and that's where we're really

1364
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:04,959
seeing vulnerabilities so far

1365
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:07,419
vulnerabilities and medical devices have

1366
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:09,729
mostly been in the computer systems that

1367
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:11,859
are around them so you hear well an MRI

1368
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:14,109
machine you know got infected with wanna

1369
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:16,269
cry and what it is is the old Windows

1370
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:18,069
machine that's used to program to

1371
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:19,868
control to export data from the MRI

1372
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:22,538
machine not the real-time embedded

1373
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:25,119
operating system which is bad but at

1374
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:27,219
least it's not you know a 10,000

1375
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,119
infusion pumps each with a ransomware

1376
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:33,789
message quick question on the

1377
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,289
applications you've deployed for the

1378
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:37,839
open eyes platform have you ever

1379
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:39,640
implemented anywhere outside of hospital

1380
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,769
or larger healthcare systems you know

1381
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,368
with the advent of value-based care

1382
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:47,379
pushing to other modalities other

1383
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:49,479
locations of service so a

1384
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,369
multi-specialty group an oncology

1385
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,348
treatment center or something outside of

1386
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:55,299
kind of the infrastructure required to

1387
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:58,689
dissapoint this yes so that's really the

1388
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:01,900
dream one of my motivations and doing

1389
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:03,969
this work is I think that as we start to

1390
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,669
have automated care I think that will in

1391
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:09,549
some circumstances you know patient

1392
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:11,408
monitoring alarms some kind of you know

1393
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:12,849
titrating drugs to affect that kind of

1394
00:54:11,409 --> 00:54:15,009
stuff I think algorithms can do a better

1395
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,659
job than people you obviously still need

1396
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:18,309
human clinicians you need people to set

1397
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:20,019
this up there are lots of things that

1398
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:22,239
the algorithms are nowhere near ready to

1399
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:23,709
handle but there are niches where the

1400
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,509
algorithms can do a better job we're

1401
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:28,390
seeing some automated systems being

1402
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:32,380
deployed in those kind of settings like

1403
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:34,808
for conscious sedation for some kinds of

1404
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:39,989
procedures there's commercial systems

1405
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:43,509
now that do that for our implementation

1406
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:44,890
some some times that it's picked up and

1407
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:46,180
used by folks we know about because they

1408
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,069
get in touch

1409
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,870
it's a bsd to clause license at this

1410
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,810
point we know that it's been picked up

1411
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,130
by a couple of companies to build into

1412
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,470
commercial products and that's great we

1413
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:57,130
want them to do that there's no

1414
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,569
requirement that they tell us what

1415
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,550
they're doing so we don't know

1416
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:03,280
everywhere that it's ended up but it has

1417
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,900
been used for better alarm systems I

1418
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,160
think mostly in it in acute care

1419
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:11,560
settings mostly in hospital settings

1420
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:13,029
okay thank you so I work in the optical

1421
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,830
industry so it's a guess it's a little

1422
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:18,330
different in that no one is going to die

1423
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:20,799
from the type of things we're doing to

1424
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:22,509
speak to his comment I can tell you one

1425
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,590
of the more popular software packages

1426
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:28,390
has the name of the support company that

1427
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,430
is the vendor and a seven character

1428
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:33,580
password yeah baked in that can't be

1429
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:36,669
changed and related to what you said

1430
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:38,650
earlier about the MRI machine I'm

1431
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,660
dealing with two hundred thousand dollar

1432
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,970
cameras that a small practice doesn't

1433
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,640
want to change out but it's paired to a

1434
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,399
app that only works in Windows XP yep

1435
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:51,100
and needs an old version of Java yeah

1436
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,340
how do we hold these manufacturers

1437
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,740
accountable for having software that has

1438
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,450
to be so out-of-date to work with the

1439
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,990
device that's still perfectly functional

1440
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:03,790
right and so I'm really interested in

1441
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,950
industrial control systems my other talk

1442
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,480
on Sunday is about manufacturing micro

1443
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,790
electrical mechanical systems in your

1444
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,560
basement and so I'm running Windows 98

1445
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,830
there because I need to that's what my

1446
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:23,770
mass spec needs so very feel your pain

1447
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:25,420
the I guess to further complicate it the

1448
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:27,940
medical device world is one where

1449
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:30,700
companies get bought sold change hands

1450
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:34,120
very very often and so even a company

1451
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,830
like GE not to pick on anyone but even a

1452
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,870
company like GE a lot of their products

1453
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,400
with their logo on it are things that

1454
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,080
were built by another company maybe a

1455
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,100
long time ago that they acquired and

1456
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,779
have sort of pulled into their portfolio

1457
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,520
and so they have interoperability

1458
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,230
problems of their own within their

1459
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,610
within their own company I think that's

1460
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,610
true of most of the large companies

1461
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:57,930
so we would love to see more support for

1462
00:56:54,810 --> 00:57:00,990
older systems updated computers to run

1463
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:02,910
the older hardware but the usual answer

1464
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:05,009
is I think is probably the same in your

1465
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:07,410
industry where the the company says well

1466
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,030
no we built that 20 years ago the new

1467
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,390
stuff is so much better in what you

1468
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:14,840
really need to do is buy a new system

1469
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:17,370
what we end up doing in practice is and

1470
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:19,290
this is for the older systems that's

1471
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,670
also for most of the medical devices is

1472
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:23,340
saying that these devices are either

1473
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,870
known to be insecure or not known to be

1474
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,150
secure nothing's known to be secure

1475
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:29,160
right so what we're going to do is

1476
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,320
segment them firewall them do as much

1477
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,910
intrusion detection as we can and try to

1478
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,730
really keep them locked off and

1479
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,529
separated so that it's as difficult as

1480
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:39,780
possible there is many you know

1481
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:44,040
safeguards as possible to keep the

1482
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:46,740
devices from being accessed and saying

1483
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,690
that well maybe you can go maybe you can

1484
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,149
go on bing and you can find a manual

1485
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:55,280
with that secret password but you can't

1486
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,280
actually get to the device to type it in

1487
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:04,820
