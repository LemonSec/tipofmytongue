1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
yeah I travel all over the world giving

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:11,219
talks and workshops that's one of the

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:12,990
things I do a lot and I give soldering

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,870
workshops how many people here have

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,820
soldered awesome

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,730
soldering is great it's one of the

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,609
things that's a life force and I do

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,300
little ones starting way back when and

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,310
big ones including here at Hope and I

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,030
wrote a comic book about how to solder

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,219
and see the title it's true it's easy

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,930
and anyone can learn come on to the

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,600
hardware hacking village and you can

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,110
learn too I have a lot of kits that I've

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,340
made to teach people who've never

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,680
soldered before how to solder well and

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,059
these are just a few of them and even

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,640
people who know how to solder can have

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,269
fun doing these my latest kit is our do

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,039
touch music synthesizer a kit because it

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,420
didn't seem to be any kits around that

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,540
made really awesome noises the hardware

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,920
for this is quite simple it's just

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,720
Arduino in the corner which is really

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,729
just a microcontroller on a board a

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,770
little audio amp and speaker and then

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,259
touch keyboard with a couple of pots and

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,080
buttons that's really it the hardware is

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,990
simple but the the firmware the

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,420
controlling software took me over two

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,408
years to make with a brilliant firmware

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,409
engineer a friend of mine but I've

33
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,780
started with a very alpha version of

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,049
this doing workshops around the world

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,329
and these are just three of many from a

36
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,020
couple years ago to present most

37
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:49,320
recently at hackerspace in radioa in

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,119
Zagreb Croatia but now it's mature I'm

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,250
about to have the latest release on my

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,110
github but this is good for learning to

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,700
solder it's also really good for

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,350
learning how to program your own music

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,890
synthesizers I have good documentation

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,899
and you can also if you want to learn

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,420
how to do your own digital signal

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,818
processing which is the fancy phrase for

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,560
how to do cool things with digital and

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,679
analog

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,610
and convert back and forth and in this

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,650
case make cool sounds noise and music

51
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,250
nasty noises great stuff whatever so I

52
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,080
love stuff like this and here's just a

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,319
little demo hopefully the audio and

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
video

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,709
[Music]

56
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,359
cool noises

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,930
and even musically

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,930
so

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,180
this is a synthesizer it comes with the

60
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,370
microcontroller comes pre-programmed and

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,930
you can reprogram it with a lot of very

62
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,609
very different synthesizers and I'll

63
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,099
have just some brief demos at the very

64
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,439
end as well but just I wanted to just

65
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,480
put this in some context not that this

66
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,400
matches up to what I'm going to show but

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,108
one of the early forms of electronic

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,239
music is from this guy Leon theremin who

69
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:16,030
made the thing that is really well known

70
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,870
mostly for bad Hollywood movies about

71
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,299
sci-fi from the 50s but it's a great

72
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,639
instrument and you can be a virtuoso on

73
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:28,389
it there's going to be talk and/or

74
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,370
performance rather tonight by Amanda I

75
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,750
forget her last name but she's amazing

76
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,700
and she's going to give a workshop as

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,290
well and one of my I've been into this

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,358
stuff since I was a little kid and

79
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,340
making my own music synthesizers my

80
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,620
professor at the University of Illinois

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,689
where a lot of really amazing early

82
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,739
music synthesizer and electronic music

83
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:52,930
came from made his own in 1964 and here

84
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,060
he is just a few months ago a little

85
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,590
older than when I remember I've been a

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,680
long time since I've been in university

87
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,439
but just playing an emulator of it in a

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,159
museum at the University and one of my

89
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,228
kind of musical Acrobat heroes keith

90
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
emerson from long ago i know a lot of

91
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,590
people think it's pretentious but

92
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,189
whatever it was the 70s i love this

93
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,978
stuff so he played a Moog synthesizer

94
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:20,409
which was an analog synthesizer and when

95
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,870
these early digital ones came along that

96
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:26,259
were really cheap this was like 70 bucks

97
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,479
in 1979 and it worked it was cheesy

98
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,190
sounds but it worked and then Yamaha

99
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,099
came up with this and of course I bought

100
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,949
and when used for really cheap I got

101
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:38,710
lucked out and this has great noises and

102
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,530
this is totally digital but even before

103
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,830
that I made my own digital music

104
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,750
synthesizer and was my master's thesis

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,650
and so I've been fascinated with this

106
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:54,639
stuff ever since and this is way easier

107
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,469
to use in my master's thesis but it

108
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,450
works and you solder together and you

109
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:58,880
can get that set all those sounds and

110
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,979
more

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,000
for that earlier demo video I showed you

112
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,760
and but there's really two kind of main

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,740
ways of doing music synthesis and

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,760
generating your own with making circuits

115
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,070
one is analog like this mini Moog from

116
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,670
1970 my roommate had one in college and

117
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:23,270
it was way fun to play with but nowadays

118
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:25,570
for less that was $2,000 and this is

119
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,700
like seventy bucks

120
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,349
teenage engineering pocket operator they

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,640
have a bunch of cool things there's a

122
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:38,020
lot of stuff out there so analog they

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,849
start with a bunch of simple basic

124
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,010
waveforms sine square triangle sawtooth

125
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,910
which looks kind of like this tooth of a

126
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,520
saw

127
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,490
and then you can have knobs to change

128
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,250
and mix and filter them to muck with a

129
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,930
sound in all sorts of fun ways but I'm

130
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,020
talking about digital here that's what

131
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,290
my thing is it's using microcontrollers

132
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,440
computer chips in order to do amazing

133
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,570
things to generate sound and hopefully

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,410
music and hopefully noise because noise

135
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,290
is cool too

136
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,810
so if digital it's all about bits and

137
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,220
you break the analog world that's what

138
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,480
we live in the analog world where

139
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,100
everything is kind of smooth and

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,080
continuous and you break it down into

141
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,210
little bits and then you muck with it in

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,950
all sorts of interesting ways and then

143
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,870
you put it back together so it's back in

144
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,570
the analog world where it can affect our

145
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,820
lives hopefully in better ways so

146
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:33,260
there's a lot of different kinds of

147
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,810
digital synthesis and I'm going to talk

148
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,270
about one form which I'll show third but

149
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,370
additive is really interesting you can

150
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,190
take a whole bunch of the simple sine

151
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,380
waves these smooth ones like the one on

152
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,560
the top there add it with other sine

153
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,980
waves of various frequencies and volumes

154
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,590
amplitudes and you can get whatever wave

155
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,140
form you want and this is one that shows

156
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,810
that adding some sine waves together get

157
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,610
things that start approximating a square

158
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,190
wave and if you add enough of them

159
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,290
together you get something

160
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,719
indistinguishable from a square wave

161
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:13,170
another kind which the dx7 had is

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,460
em and that gets just crazy noises and

163
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,890
you can see have things that sound like

164
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,539
bells and trumpets and that's just

165
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,640
changing the frequency back and forth

166
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,780
really freely fast with sine waves or

167
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,300
other waveforms what I and my art you

168
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,010
touch uses both of those kinds as well

169
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,580
but primarily I'm going to talk about

170
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,860
wave table because this is an easy way

171
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,479
to start learning about digital signal

172
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,160
processing so I don't know if any of you

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,030
when you were a kid or even when you're

174
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,820
an adult

175
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,859
take a turntable with vinyl records and

176
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,260
you can spin it around and make the

177
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,660
thing go faster or slower or even

178
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,240
backwards you can do that it was well

179
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,310
with tapes when you go faster of course

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,770
the pitch gets higher and faster and

181
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,370
when you slow it down it gets really

182
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,799
zero you can do that with a tape as well

183
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,830
and wavetable synthesis is kind of like

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,080
that except it's digital a digital form

185
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,030
of that the waveform is in memory

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,190
instead and you can play it back from

187
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,340
memory faster and slower that's one way

188
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,240
you can do it so let's see how to do

189
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,400
that so we have starting with some

190
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,610
waveform this is just a simple sine wave

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,090
one cycle of one and it's smooth even

192
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,099
sees all the there's so many points you

193
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,110
can't see their points that's like how

194
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,370
our processing works in our brain and

195
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,930
all these sounds are coming out they're

196
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,330
pushing on our eardrums we're processing

197
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:43,859
it in an analogue way everything's

198
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,960
smooth we can't use this on a computer

199
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,330
we have to break it down into bits and

200
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,900
what we can do is slice it up with all

201
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,820
these vertical slices in practice we

202
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,860
want to have many many more vertical

203
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,430
slices but I'm just having here simple

204
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,300
break it up into ten slices and at each

205
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:06,420
slice there's a value and I can put a

206
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,449
dot there so it starts at zero and goes

207
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,540
sort of 2/3 up and then almost the top

208
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,440
and down and back up and around and you

209
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,430
can figure out the values of those and

210
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,370
write them down and they

211
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,800
you can put them in a table each one of

212
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,220
those dots with its value is called a

213
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,020
sample that's the technical term but

214
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,610
it's really just the value of each slice

215
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,890
and doing this is called sampling so we

216
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,839
sampled the waveform we put it there and

217
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,360
in practice with computers what we do is

218
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,500
put that exactly the same thing except

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,990
now

220
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,310
oh yeah it's called sampling now it's

221
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,430
the same thing except we put it in

222
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:51,089
memory so I have 10 memory locations 0

223
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,930
through 9 and I've got values so that is

224
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:59,190
a sampled one cycle of a sine wave with

225
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:03,569
10 samples 10 slices it's making sense

226
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,950
it's not too hard I hope cool so you

227
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,660
don't have to have a simple wave form

228
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,250
like a sine wave and you can have way

229
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,469
more than 10 values in memory but you

230
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,630
can have complex waveforms and that's

231
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,970
like a teeny little bit of a piano sound

232
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:23,430
and and put that in memory and that's

233
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:27,300
digitizing the waveform but that is

234
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,849
called digital to analog conversion what

235
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,219
I just described and so we start with a

236
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,730
waveform we do analog to digital and we

237
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:40,560
end up with all the values in memory

238
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:43,770
which are that waveform kind of as the

239
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,630
computer sees it to get it back into our

240
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,449
real world we've got to do the opposite

241
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,279
analog to digital conversion so I have

242
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,959
another diagram which looks very similar

243
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:59,250
but backwards Oh a 2d sorry

244
00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:03,239
so a / D is the abbreviation analog to

245
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,880
digital conversion so to play it back we

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,910
do the opposite and here's the opposite

247
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,070
we have values in memory we do one value

248
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,750
at a time feed it to this black box here

249
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,480
calling it digital to analog converter

250
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,329
and out comes this analog signal

251
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,370
something that we can put into a spiffy

252
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,719
amplifier and make lots of noise and

253
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:27,550
sound and music okay so this is called D

254
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,680
/ a that's the

255
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:34,209
but most people into this stuff call it

256
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,849
and so dita a but what's inside of this

257
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:40,930
Dida a box oh I forgot to mention also

258
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,630
let me go back here with a 2d inside of

259
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,029
that black box it can be a chip or it

260
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,189
can usually nowadays even in really

261
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:53,680
cheap microcontrollers built into the

262
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:56,170
microcontroller itself and so you can do

263
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,769
this process with hardly any work at all

264
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,750
just a little bit of firmware and

265
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:04,750
controlling software so to do da it's

266
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:10,510
really similar this can be a chip or it

267
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:12,310
can be this other form called PWM the

268
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,810
chip is really cool and it works great

269
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:20,560
but it's expensive to have a good one

270
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,140
this thing called PWM is what I use with

271
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,949
my RG Touch synthesizer a lot of people

272
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,839
use it and it's free it takes time to

273
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,160
write the controlling software the

274
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,070
firmware it's called in a

275
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,000
microcontroller computer chips so let's

276
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,760
see how this works so I'll tell you what

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,820
PWM actually means at the end of this so

278
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,770
a square wave is a square it's on for

279
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,079
half the time off for half the time on

280
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,660
off on off on off whatever rate it is

281
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:56,829
it's always on half the time and off

282
00:12:49,660 --> 00:13:01,000
half the time and this would be half the

283
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:02,890
time on so it has half the energy from

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,709
if the signal we're just high all the

285
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,140
time all right we can make this though

286
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:12,040
not a square wave half and a half but a

287
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:15,579
pulse wave where it's on for some time

288
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,819
and off for the rest and it can be 25%

289
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:22,449
on 75 off or whatever percentage we want

290
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,920
so here's just a bunch of different ones

291
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,290
and they don't have to be round numbers

292
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,430
either they can be absolutely any ratio

293
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:33,160
we want which means we can have whatever

294
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:35,339
energy we want compared to if it's on

295
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:41,550
all the time

296
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:45,450
okay so this is called PWM because we

297
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,459
can vary the width between zero on one

298
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,320
hundred percent off or all the way up to

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,130
a hundred percent on zero off and

300
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,529
anything in between in electronics when

301
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,529
you change the value of something over

302
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:01,380
time the fancy word is modulation so

303
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:04,650
this is modulating the on time or or

304
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,800
modulating the amount of energy over

305
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:11,490
time and we're varying that with pulse

306
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,490
widths so pulse width modulation so this

307
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,210
is what we do for our DITA a in order to

308
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,210
convert the numbers into an analog

309
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:25,310
signal by taking let me go back to that

310
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,540
table the numbers from here and

311
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,619
converting that just into a percentage

312
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,550
on/off for pulse waves going through our

313
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,010
and that's actually in the

314
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,150
microcontroller the DITA a and then we

315
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,790
get the signal we can put a new

316
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,490
amplifier and make noise and wonderful

317
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,319
stuff even music although according to

318
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,350
John age John Cage

319
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:56,400
everything's music and I think that's

320
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:58,500
cool so but in practice things are a

321
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,589
little bit different than in that theory

322
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,800
I just told you what we want is for

323
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,720
these numbers to go into our DITA a

324
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,569
which is pulse width modulation and out

325
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,050
comes a perfect replication of what we

326
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,990
recorded earlier with analog to digital

327
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:18,630
doesn't work that way unfortunately

328
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,459
because we've digitized and when we

329
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,980
bring it back to the analog world it's

330
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:26,969
going to be funky we get this sort of

331
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,100
staircase effect that's what the e

332
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,620
signal would look like which is a bit

333
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:37,290
different than that so fortunately

334
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:41,459
according to theory all we need is a

335
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,800
perfect low-pass filter between our

336
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,229
black box did d/a-converter in this case

337
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,660
pulse mode pulse width modulation go

338
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,040
through the

339
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,719
perfect low-pass filter and we get this

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,410
perfect waveform exactly what we

341
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,430
recorded earlier perfect doesn't exist

342
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,939
in our world

343
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,540
have you noticed our world isn't perfect

344
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:04,750
whatever that would mean it's not it so

345
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:08,529
they don't exist but we can have a

346
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,839
really cheap low-pass filter and then we

347
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:15,790
get this thing that looks very sine wave

348
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:18,490
like but it's kind of Wiggly and ugly so

349
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,339
what we do to fix that problem is

350
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,319
instead of having just ten samples we

351
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:26,110
can have many many many more and it's a

352
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:30,939
better better approximation and so if we

353
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:34,050
have say 256 instead of ten then we get

354
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:36,279
this which to our eyeballs is

355
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,740
indistinguishable from the original

356
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,170
signal our ears are a bit more sensitive

357
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,079
when it comes to things so we can hear

358
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,790
some of the strange artifacts of digital

359
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,310
which is why digital is never quite as

360
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,199
good as really really good analog but

361
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,130
it's still really cool we can do lots of

362
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,859
stuff with it so what we want is lots

363
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,949
more samples and also it's more accurate

364
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,420
if our table of numbers all the samples

365
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:05,428
have more bits

366
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,869
so if we have 8-bit word 8-bit bytes

367
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:10,360
that's less accurate but it's still

368
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:15,849
really good if we have 16-bit words for

369
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:19,448
each sample that's even better so that

370
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,849
is how we get from the analog world to

371
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,350
having in a computer and then once it's

372
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,329
in the computer we can muck with it and

373
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:29,678
then send it out in the the DITA aid to

374
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:33,100
get actual sound in music but what pitch

375
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,590
is it and by pitch that's frequency is a

376
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,189
fancy electronic word but pitch is a

377
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,320
musical note all the way from way down

378
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,730
low and the low part of the keyboard all

379
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,020
the way up I don't know but the high

380
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,030
part of the keyboard and you don't even

381
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,049
need a keyboard it's just pitch musical

382
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:55,119
sounds so to talk about pitch I have to

383
00:17:50,049 --> 00:18:01,129
get into a bit of math we okay with math

384
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:02,689
sorry so this isn't too complicated but

385
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:05,418
you know hopefully you'll just get a

386
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:09,559
feel for this so you can have the

387
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:11,989
sampling rate when you do the analog to

388
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,330
digital conversion we have while we're

389
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:16,399
actually recording in real time we can

390
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,519
break it up into the signal into slices

391
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:22,279
at very fast speeds and with a cheap

392
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,129
microcontroller not so fast but with our

393
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,710
G touch it was at fifteen thousand times

394
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:32,029
a second if we have a sine wave say with

395
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,729
256 memory locations 256 samples and it

396
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:40,219
got stored in there 15 thousandth of a

397
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:42,409
second apiece that's a 15,000 times the

398
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:50,059
second sample rate to our 15 kilohertz

399
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:53,619
sample rate okay so for that if we go

400
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:56,989
through all the values of one sine wave

401
00:18:53,619 --> 00:19:01,119
15th of a second each then we go through

402
00:18:56,989 --> 00:19:02,239
the complete cycle in we can do that in

403
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,499
58.6

404
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:10,129
times a second so that's the note we

405
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:13,219
would get with the sampling rate given

406
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:19,309
at the rate that the RG touch is

407
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:21,950
possible to do that's a low note that's

408
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:26,678
a pitch which is not even one in our

409
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:30,409
standard musical scale it's a little bit

410
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:34,369
near a sharp the second to lowest a

411
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:36,139
sharp not the most useful pitch we want

412
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,389
to have whatever pitch we want not just

413
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:43,008
be stuck with one so we have to change

414
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:44,718
that if you remember we had the like the

415
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,190
tape loop thing and there was a speed

416
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:48,529
control so we can speed it up and slow

417
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,210
it down that's one way to change the

418
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,309
pitch and we can change the pitch to be

419
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,919
whatever we want that way you can go

420
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,320
through the table that way and get

421
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,299
whatever pitch you want but one

422
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,950
fifteenth of a second is the fastest we

423
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,320
can go through those so the highest note

424
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,399
we could get in that mess

425
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,250
it would be 58.6 like about a sharp on

426
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,370
the lowest of the keyboard not so cool

427
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:17,639
so another way to do it is to skip

428
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:23,379
samples and that's actually called

429
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:25,779
interpolating interpolating let me show

430
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,200
you how that works so let's say we want

431
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:32,049
to have exactly an A and in musical

432
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,419
theory a and modern music is is it

433
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:42,509
defined as 440 Hertz so 440 times a

434
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:46,389
second we that's an a we want that at

435
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:49,629
15,000 samples per second 15 kilohertz

436
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:54,070
sample rate divide that from 440 and we

437
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:57,789
get 30 4.0 9 steps that we have to skip

438
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:01,178
in our table each time in order to get

439
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:03,460
that speed 440 times a second for the

440
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,779
complete cycle again and again 440 times

441
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:11,710
a second how do we do thirty four point

442
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:14,230
oh nine memory locations that's not so

443
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,950
easy it's not so hard though we can do

444
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,720
some tricks

445
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:22,389
so this is where interpolation comes in

446
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,370
that's a mathematical term sorry about

447
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:25,000
the math but it's not so hard it's bear

448
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,979
with me here

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,700
so the first sample is just location

450
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:36,250
zero the next sample is thirty four

451
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:39,129
point oh nine locations later we can't

452
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,340
do thirty four point oh nine we can do

453
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:44,500
thirty four we can do thirty five but

454
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,080
what we want is to take the values that

455
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,090
are in these memory locations whatever

456
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,799
is in thirty four add it to what's in 35

457
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:58,080
and take some kind of weighted

458
00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:02,080
difference that's point O nine away from

459
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,750
34 and pretty far away from thirty-five

460
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,250
so really close to 34 we can do this as

461
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,700
accurately as we want with a

462
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,779
microcontroller using fixed point

463
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,619
mathematic

464
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:16,259
arithmetic so the next one is going to

465
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,769
be thirty four point zero nine later

466
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,469
than thirty four point oh nine to get to

467
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:26,429
sixty eight point one eight and again we

468
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:28,799
do a weighted average between 68 and 69

469
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,349
to get the proper value and we feed that

470
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,349
into the DDA and then for the next

471
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:36,739
sample the fourth one we add thirty four

472
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:39,899
point oh nine to the last one and we get

473
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:42,179
102.3 seven that's between 102 and 103 a

474
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:47,299
weighted average of that sand that into

475
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:53,909
the GA and etc etc eventually we get to

476
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:56,339
the seventh sample and nope that one's

477
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,589
supposed to be down at the bottom sorry

478
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:05,190
and then we add thirty four point oh

479
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:09,119
nine and we get to 72 point seven two

480
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:11,039
and we only have 256 memory locations so

481
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:15,718
we've got a wrap-up to the beginning and

482
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,219
then go to what turns out to be sixteen

483
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,719
point seven two and we do a weighted

484
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,369
average we just keep going and going and

485
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:21,989
going and then we get this really nice

486
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:27,418
sine wave if we put it through our

487
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:29,239
low-pass filter and now that's really

488
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:35,239
all there is to that

489
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:37,979
so that's somewhat complicated to code

490
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:39,779
even if that all made total sense to you

491
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:41,279
it's somewhat complicated to code and

492
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,139
you're doing this all in real time and

493
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,479
have to keep up with it and not run out

494
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:48,988
of time and have a glitch and your sound

495
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:52,619
on unintentionally all the glitches and

496
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:55,200
sound can be really nice but but if you

497
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,539
don't want to do it you know it's a bit

498
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,749
tricky to do so with my r2 touch

499
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:05,099
I made the controlling software the

500
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:08,269
firmware which is an in Arduino and our

501
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:10,468
dwee no programs are called sketches

502
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,210
that's because our dwee knows were made

503
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,499
for non geeky artists and non geeky

504
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,659
artists they thought would be afraid of

505
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:18,059
the word program so it's not a program

506
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,460
it's a sketch because artists sketch but

507
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,990
it's a program and

508
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,570
so they are to touch program the sketch

509
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,520
I made it easy for people to do all of

510
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,620
this so you don't even have to think

511
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,389
about it but it's really interesting to

512
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,280
read my documentation in the comments

513
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,560
because it teaches you how this all

514
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,629
works and of course everything I do is

515
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,520
open source so you can hack on it and if

516
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,810
you do anything cool just you know let

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,120
me know so with the artichoke all you

518
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,190
have to do is create oscillators and

519
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,500
that's just a couple lines of code and

520
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,420
an oscillator can be square wave sine

521
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,210
waves complex waveforms whatever you

522
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,130
want and then that can happen when you

523
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,320
press keys on the keyboard or it can

524
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,430
just do it when you do the knobs or

525
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,220
press buttons and then that makes these

526
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,380
sort of static sounding waveforms

527
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,620
they're just not changing when you push

528
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,760
the key it's on and it stays the same as

529
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,949
long as you're pressing in keene you let

530
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,540
go the key it's off so what we have

531
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:22,560
what's called dynamics which alter that

532
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:26,220
sound over time and that's what makes

533
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,409
sounds interesting like on a piano

534
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,230
keyboard you don't push the button on it

535
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:34,800
push a key push that button and it's

536
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:38,700
just on when you push the key it goes

537
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,500
down and decays over time and the sound

538
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,440
actually has different harmonics and

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,180
different richness that changes even as

540
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,270
you're holding the key and it kind of

541
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:52,350
decays the dynamics you know music

542
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,850
synthesizer can add those kind of things

543
00:25:52,350 --> 00:26:00,480
to it so you have a really interesting

544
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:02,219
sound and yeah all that's kind of

545
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,680
complicated to code but that's really

546
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:10,950
easy in my sketch from Arduino so the

547
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,680
oscillators have these waveforms and

548
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:16,740
others the dynamics can do lots and lots

549
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,070
of different things including a DSR

550
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,030
which I'll talk about next and tremolo

551
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,260
which is making the well after they have

552
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,190
some slides for that so let me show you

553
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,890
what these things are

554
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:32,220
so a DSR is what I described with a

555
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,630
piano when you press the key it goes up

556
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,490
really fast

557
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,770
loudness goes up really fast and then

558
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,720
down really fast and then decays slowly

559
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,850
over time as long as you're holding the

560
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,430
button holding the key and then when you

561
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,360
let go it decays quickly so this is

562
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,450
what's happening here

563
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,520
attack is when you hit the key decay

564
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,560
happens as long as you're holding the

565
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,800
key after it decays you keep holding the

566
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,250
key it can sustain the volume for a

567
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,740
while you're let go in it decays quickly

568
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:05,040
so that's a DSR and with our do touch

569
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,770
and other synthesizer software out there

570
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:12,120
this is really standard and this is

571
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:15,690
called a sound envelope so the envelope

572
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,580
is the the volume over time and you can

573
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,980
do some really interesting kind of

574
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,260
effects by making the attack decay

575
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,940
sustain release instead of like over

576
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,410
several seconds long you can make it

577
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,700
fractions of a second and repeat and

578
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,680
repeat and repeat and then you get these

579
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:34,620
bizarre sounds which is really cool so

580
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,530
tremolo is changing the volume somewhat

581
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,540
quickly and you can do that with sound

582
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,850
sine waves square waves triangle waves

583
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,030
or whatever and whatever rate you like

584
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,750
so it can be kind of like Momo Momo Momo

585
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,750
Momo or

586
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,010
whatever rate you want and it can be on

587
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,780
off on off so it's and it's if you make

588
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,379
that really fast and you get also really

589
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,840
cool stuff portamento is the glide

590
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,610
between OneNote now there it was and

591
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,370
that first demo I showed you that was

592
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:10,800
there so you can hit a note and then go

593
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,800
up here instead of going mm-hmm

594
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,080
and that's the glide portamento is the

595
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,610
musical term that can go really fast and

596
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,439
can also repeat and if you can do that

597
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,070
really fast at fractions of a second

598
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,690
that's called FM synthesis synthesis and

599
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:32,409
you get all those crazy sounds you can

600
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,940
get on the dx7 and more envelopes you

601
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,100
can do not just attack decay sustain

602
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,850
release but some of those other things I

603
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,030
was talking about

604
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:43,270
I'm just mucking with the volume over

605
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,370
time filters like some example of a

606
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,250
filter that most people have heard of is

607
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,719
of trouble and bass controls but those

608
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,730
can change automatically with your

609
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,850
program control over time to get lots

610
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,190
and lots of interesting things a bass is

611
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,469
kind of like a low pass filter it passes

612
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:01,480
low frequencies but not high treble is

613
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,370
like high pass filters at less high

614
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,580
through but not low you can also have a

615
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,860
band pass filter so some pitches in the

616
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,710
middle come through and the others not

617
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,600
much at all and if you slide that window

618
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,200
back and forth and you do that really

619
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,610
fast then you can get trippy sounds so

620
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,310
our two touch we have the way it ways to

621
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,229
do that and some of those I call effects

622
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,870
it's just messing with the sound in all

623
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,200
sorts of ways and all of that is just

624
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:31,719
done with some simple lines of code with

625
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,640
it's all our do we know compatible and

626
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:39,670
Arduino like I said it's designed for

627
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:41,200
non geeky artists and if you have a code

628
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,850
that's written well and commented other

629
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,240
people can learn from it and I've got a

630
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:49,300
bunch of examples that come with my

631
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,760
Arduino library and so you can download

632
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,330
all this for free from my website or my

633
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,080
github and and now now I've given it all

634
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,669
to Microsoft

635
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,360
yay so if you follow examples 0 through

636
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:10,690
R 1 through 9 that's a way to learn how

637
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:13,439
to program your own synthesizers using

638
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,660
my code I have some really cool

639
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,210
synthesizers that make great sounds and

640
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,190
music and noise but you can make your

641
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,630
own and if you do something please share

642
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:28,360
it with me and do cool things so

643
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,820
the library has a bunch of low-level

644
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,979
things that are the tricky things but

645
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,049
make high level of just function calls

646
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,820
available and you can just hack on the

647
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:39,790
stuff that I made or come up with your

648
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:47,189
own it's really easy to manipulate these

649
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:50,740
things to make crazy zones so I have

650
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,700
just lots and lots of things for mucking

651
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,000
with the sound

652
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:58,990
lots of waveforms some really

653
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,770
interesting complex ones as well you can

654
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,330
with this sketch this ones makes a

655
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,570
sawtooth this is the complete

656
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:11,290
synthesizer for making when you press

657
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:14,500
keys to get sawtooth sound one sawtooth

658
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,909
wave and make it any note you can go up

659
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,830
and down octaves you can play with the

660
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:22,830
buttons with the pot from a different

661
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:25,570
volume and not much else but you can see

662
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,330
there's only a few lines of codes and a

663
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,040
bunch of it is comments not even code

664
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,549
and you don't have to understand

665
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,290
everything about C++ which is what

666
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,940
Arduino uses even though they don't call

667
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,320
it that because it's made for non geeky

668
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,400
artists and they change the word to call

669
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,379
it wiring but it's C++ so but it's just

670
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,330
a few lines of C++ code and you don't

671
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,760
have to understand it you just use it

672
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,500
and the comments tell you what to do and

673
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,460
if you follow through the examples this

674
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,830
is example 8 this will make enough sense

675
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,960
so you can just try it yourself hack on

676
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,000
it see what happens I can't do anything

677
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,230
wrong well it might not work too well

678
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,510
but you won't hurt anything it won't

679
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:09,790
damage anything maybe your your

680
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:12,160
roommates sensibilities but yeah so it's

681
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,590
really really easy from this total basic

682
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,880
one to add tremolo portamento those

683
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,470
things I was talking about envelopes

684
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,240
filters effects and there's some really

685
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,610
interesting effects as well as well as

686
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,840
cooler waveforms

687
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,840
here's another demo

688
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:32,240
this one makes a drone and you can play

689
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,940
on top of it and I make sure that you

690
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,210
can't press a wrong note

691
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:43,179
and this is an Indian scale or Indian

692
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,179
ish so it's kind of exotic sounding

693
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,340
it's kind of minor but it's not

694
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,469
and this has different presets as well

695
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:56,349
for having different drones and

696
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:58,959
different scale and I'm always making

697
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,820
these better too and that one's kind of

698
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,839
beautiful even though it's dark but I

699
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:10,109
like dark too

700
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:10,109
so this one is nasty called Lloyd

701
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,550
with the parts to make things

702
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,550
[Applause]

703
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,550
consents

704
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,019
allow me

705
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,149
thirty more seconds

706
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:53,509
here's a preset

707
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,640
drive everyone crazy

708
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:17,288
so any kids out there if your parents

709
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:20,250
are being mean for an upstairs neighbor

710
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,250
who is having

711
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:34,440
different presets I think you get the

712
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:36,759
idea there again all this is on github

713
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,349
play with it do what you want if you do

714
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,349
something interesting please let me know

715
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:45,099
I'll share it with everyone else and you

716
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:49,230
know I've got a bunch of these kits on

717
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:51,700
the mezzanine but all day all night

718
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:55,270
I'll teach anyone to solder on the

719
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:57,220
mezzanine please come if you like and a

720
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,790
bunch of other people have their kits

721
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:05,020
there as well and there's also some free

722
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:07,300
blinky badge kits from hackaday supply

723
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,220
frame and tindy they're all kind of one

724
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,980
company so you can grab those and learn

725
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,509
to solder with for free with those the

726
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,839
other kits who you have to charge for

727
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:19,619
the materials but anyways that's what I

728
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,619
had to say

729
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:37,109
yeah so if you got any questions

730
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:40,170
comments divisions as there is there any

731
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:42,270
support for MIDI microphone right now

732
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,359
there's no support for MIDI so I'm

733
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:49,200
working on another version of this to

734
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,180
have more cool functions this is using

735
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,589
are the cheapest version of Arduino

736
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,029
because I wanted this to be as cheap as

737
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,220
possible eventually I want it to be like

738
00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:00,330
twenty five dollar kit right now I have

739
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,868
to charge thirty for it but by getting

740
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,520
parts in volume I can maybe bring it

741
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:09,450
down to twenty-five and because of that

742
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,400
I use the cheapest Arduino kind of

743
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,310
microcontroller which only has so many

744
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,190
input/output pins and I don't have

745
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,549
enough pins left over for MIDI but if we

746
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:24,660
take away the keyboard then you can put

747
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:26,880
in a MIDI instead of the keyboard and

748
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,359
there's open source MIDI for Arduino

749
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,359
already there so it could be hackable

750
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:37,069
but if you take the Arduino code and

751
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,000
just switch out another spiffier

752
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,440
microcontroller every one that has lots

753
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,599
and lots of input/output pins and when

754
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,000
that goes faster and one that has 32-bit

755
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,390
things instead of 8-bit memory locations

756
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,369
you can get super high quality sound and

757
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,470
this is really nice sound for this

758
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:55,859
really cheap thing but we can get way

759
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,299
way better and that has lots of

760
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:59,910
input/output pins so we can have MIDI

761
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,640
and it's card we know compatible a bunch

762
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,339
of these chips so with just changing one

763
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,029
file the lowest level stuff I should be

764
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:12,779
able to have it have MIDI plus lots of

765
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,660
other cool functions but that's not next

766
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,940
week

767
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,288
so in between travel time is when I'm

768
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,849
doing this along with the help of my

769
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:25,490
friend bill he was just always playing

770
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:28,039
with this stuff on the one slide you had

771
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,950
the multiple sine waves that added

772
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,740
together to make a difference can you do

773
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,839
that with the PWM recreation of the sine

774
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,669
wave or would you even want to do that

775
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,440
would that be advantageous in any way

776
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,410
and would that be like multiple PWM

777
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,099
layers or something yeah so the PWM you

778
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,259
can you can it's just whatever value you

779
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,750
put in it's a deed to a converter so you

780
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:54,170
put in values and it can be random just

781
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:57,769
to get whatever it can be a nice sine

782
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,480
wave it can be a nasty sounds and

783
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:01,220
pleasant sounds whatever it can be

784
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,190
complex sounds it can be a recording of

785
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:07,490
a piano whatever you want but you can

786
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:11,359
also have sort of underneath the scenes

787
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:14,720
say here's the value for a sine wave of

788
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,259
this volume at this frequency and you

789
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,450
calculate those values with the wave

790
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:22,519
table of sine wave and now with the same

791
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,529
wave table of that sine wave you can say

792
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,379
okay well I'm going to have a sine wave

793
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:29,269
of a different volume amplitude and a

794
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,569
different frequency and then you can add

795
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:36,950
those values together and then send it

796
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:38,839
to the DJ and do that for every memory

797
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,069
location that you need to do to get

798
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,509
those two sine waves of different

799
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,119
volumes different amplitudes and

800
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:46,160
different frequencies and then you get

801
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,869
two sine waves added together coming out

802
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,149
of your DJ which you amplify and put

803
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,190
through a speaker or put through

804
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,680
whatever effects you want like the

805
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,380
guitar effects pedals or whatever you

806
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,690
can do that with three five twenty

807
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,920
whatever how many sine waves you want to

808
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:05,660
get whatever waveform you like adding

809
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,420
sine waves together to create whatever

810
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,598
waveform you want is done with Fourier

811
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:15,759
analysis that's a dead mathematician

812
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:19,880
from France but you left that for us so

813
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:23,580
yeah so we can do that and can also do

814
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:27,210
FM as well as wave table

815
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,590
yeah hey how are you just like they say

816
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,030
it that's a really beautiful piece of

817
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,120
hardware you built there it looks very

818
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,640
Buchla inspired you know you could see

819
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,890
that in it is there a quick and easy way

820
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,839
to implement CV I mean I know you'd

821
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,450
mentioned that there's no MIDI support

822
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,340
but perhaps there are other easier ways

823
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:50,370
to you know get access to controlling it

824
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:54,450
have you thought any bit about that or

825
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:58,200
you can you can mix digital and analog

826
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,310
so the first digital synthesizers

827
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,649
weren't really digital they were

828
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:06,029
digitally controlled analog yeah and so

829
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:08,550
you can have control voltages so all the

830
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,680
different modules in like a mini Moog or

831
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,520
even the big mode like Emerson was

832
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,560
playing those are all controlled with

833
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,000
different amount of voltages that change

834
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,100
over time and all of those can be

835
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,930
connected from oscillators and all these

836
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,200
things you see those patch cords to do

837
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,509
it

838
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,660
that's a pain but if you come up with a

839
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:29,250
patch you like it takes a long time to

840
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,960
create that patch but then you want to

841
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,970
do a different sound you go to take all

842
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,830
those away and then do a different one

843
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,529
it takes a while and if you've got a

844
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,170
live performance to do you don't want to

845
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,700
bore the audience by taking all these

846
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,350
down and then like what did I do with

847
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,129
that oh here's a chart and it's like it

848
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:49,620
takes five minutes so yeah well that's

849
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,600
an option but you know you can have

850
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:55,080
digital control of all these things and

851
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,180
have them configure themselves and but

852
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,910
you don't need to have analog to do that

853
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:04,919
you can have control voltages

854
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,420
controlling external analog things and

855
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,900
you can have them on the board and

856
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,360
whatever so I have not done that since

857
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,730
high school but I did do that in high

858
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:19,800
school I took some oscillator chips that

859
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:23,730
make analog outputs and I controlled

860
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:29,340
them digitally with a D to a converter

861
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:30,630
being my voltage control so it's fun to

862
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
do but I haven't done that since high

863
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:39,020
school

864
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:41,420
oh yeah and so you're gonna have a knob

865
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,740
with voltage control and then you can

866
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:48,680
have an A to D looking at that to have

867
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,240
the firmware the sketch in this case do

868
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,970
different things depending on that or

869
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,740
rather than a control voltage you can

870
00:41:52,970 --> 00:42:00,500
just have well I guess that's what I do

871
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,939
with my knobs there's a voltage on there

872
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,940
and as you change the knob the voltage

873
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,830
changes and that's how I tell where the

874
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,300
position of the knob is and depending on

875
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,160
the position of the knob I can do

876
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,050
different things change the volume

877
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,149
change different patterns change the

878
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:18,580
waveform or I can use the buttons to

879
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:20,960
cycle through things things like that

880
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,580
yeah I know you said you were input

881
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,170
restricted but I was wondering if you

882
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,259
have done anything any kind of

883
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:30,340
adaptation to use it as a vocoder would

884
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,820
that be fun too so with a vocoder that's

885
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:37,970
making an envelope just like a DSR

886
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,370
except the envelope is determined by the

887
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,620
sound of your voice or you can put

888
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,290
another instrument in there and then the

889
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:48,830
sound that the synthesizers making takes

890
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:51,590
on qualities of your voice or another

891
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,870
instrument and that'd be a cool thing to

892
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,760
do and the Arduino does have a 2 D

893
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,920
converters built in but I'm using all

894
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,410
those pins already but you can make

895
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,700
trade-offs you know that's just the

896
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,049
trade-offs when you have something

897
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,169
really inexpensive you trade-off

898
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:09,470
functionality and quality for the

899
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:12,530
resources available and cost so but

900
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:15,950
that'd be a fun thing to do so if you're

901
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:18,560
not using a control voltage is each key

902
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,629
attached to a different pin yeah so this

903
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,120
is uh so art you touch is named that

904
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,400
because it's Arduino compatible and it's

905
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,839
a touch keyboard you don't have to have

906
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,410
the touch keyboard but that's what I

907
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,000
have and so the way you can it there's

908
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:36,560
not a real button there just like a

909
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,690
touch screen on your your rectangles in

910
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,140
your pocket

911
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,170
it works with capacitance as this is

912
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,629
this part of a lot

913
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,460
Tronics and I'll go over that if

914
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,530
anyone's interested in my Arduino for

915
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,090
total newbies workshop or I'll go

916
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,180
through everything you need to know to

917
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:57,300
play with this kind of stuff and that's

918
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,859
three o'clock to 6:30 tomorrow but yeah

919
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,720
when you touch something it adds

920
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,820
capacitance and you stop touching it

921
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,890
takes capacitance away and you can

922
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,390
detect that and that's how you can say

923
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,799
Oh someone's pushing a button if

924
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:11,660
someone's pushing a key I should play

925
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:15,780
this frequency or do this action and

926
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,399
that's what I do there the settings

927
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,440
section yeah I guess I'm just one time

928
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,300
just to figure out if you could like

929
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,240
melt off those pads and then attach them

930
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,400
to like a different keyboard sort like

931
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,970
yeah like that which that would be a way

932
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,460
to save a bunch of pins but you trade it

933
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,770
off by having a bunch of switches yeah

934
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,950
which makes more soldering or more

935
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:40,560
solderless breadboard wiring and add

936
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,000
some cost but okay if you do I could do

937
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,360
that yeah so if you have a bunch of

938
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,030
switches then you can use less than 13

939
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,340
input pins to do that because you can

940
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,410
multiplex them just like keyboards on

941
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,780
your laptop are multiplexed there aren't

942
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,839
an input for each one they do it with

943
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,790
MUX so so yeah you can definitely do

944
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,650
that and then you got extra pins and a

945
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,830
friend of mine knew who I recently met

946
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:07,500
when I was in Zagreb Croatia he did

947
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,150
exactly that yeah so he has extra pins

948
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,590
which he's going to do something with I

949
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,550
don't know what yet Thanks yeah this has

950
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:18,030
been great thank you

951
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,920
could you use the mega and for the

952
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,500
additional pins and is there an easy

953
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,150
migration strategy from the audio touch

954
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,400
to the mega because they're not that

955
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,320
much more expensive oh yeah it's super

956
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,660
easy all you have to do is use a mega

957
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:36,600
instead so this the Archie touch library

958
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:39,180
that I have is designed for the Arduino

959
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,759
Uno so if it works for the uno it can

960
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,299
work for more powerful Arduinos as well

961
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,670
and it can work on any Arduino it's just

962
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,520
that my board has the touch keyboard and

963
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:54,710
a little kind of cheap and not so great

964
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,710
little amplifier and speaker

965
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,439
and a couple of knobs and a couple of

966
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:03,020
buttons you can easily add those if

967
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,089
you're into solderless breadboards or

968
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,910
soldering create that of your own with

969
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:10,250
any Arduino if you use an Arduino Uno

970
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:12,830
it'll be exactly like the r2 touch if

971
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,270
you use Arduino mega it can be exactly

972
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,890
like they already touch but you have all

973
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,500
these extra input/output pins that you

974
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,660
could do whatever you want with so um

975
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,280
yeah you can definitely do that and you

976
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,020
don't do anything except change the

977
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,240
setting on your Arduino software to say

978
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:33,890
