1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
I am Adam Goldstein I'm from the

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,609
foundation for individual rights in

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,230
education we're a non partisan nonprofit

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,900
that gives legal help to college

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,700
students and faculty members when they

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,549
have problems with free speech due

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,799
process and other civil rights and yeah

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,029
I want to talk about FERPA and I tweeted

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,260
it when I was promoting this I tweeted

10
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,539
that if you if you were a complicated

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,550
student you might want to look at your

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,960
at your education records and I said I

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,150
believe many of us here would be

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,570
complicated students I know I certainly

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,589
was I was not an enthusiastic student in

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,059
high school certainly I got a D in high

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,410
school English one semester which would

18
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,559
probably shock a lot of people and know

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,510
me and I got the DNA English because I

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,370
refused to read the books because the

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,190
books were fiction and I don't want to

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,959
pollute my mind with made-up stuff my

23
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,980
English teacher mrs. Hauser said but you

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,270
I saw you reading science fiction I said

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,879
science fiction isn't made-up it's just

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,740
stuff that hasn't happened yet

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,940
like you can't you can't prove it didn't

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,990
happen whereas I can prove that these

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,390
other made-up books didn't that because

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,860
they're in the past so my relationship

31
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,370
to my school administrators wasn't

32
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,350
stellar went to college in law school

33
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,270
here in New York went to Fordham got a

34
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,419
fine education from the Jesuits yes

35
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:20,110
thank you thank you thank you and then

36
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,220
applied to to join the bar because I'm a

37
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,960
lawyer I just dressed this way because

38
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,979
I'm grown I dress how I freakin like let

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,690
me give you actually a bit of life

40
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,070
advice I've noticed if you dress like

41
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,009
maintenance you can walk into any

42
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,570
building and no one stops you the only

43
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,940
trouble this ever gave me was when I was

44
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,410
speaking at Columbia and I was walking

45
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,780
by and they asked me to fix the elevator

46
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,619
and I thought about it for a minute I

47
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,590
was like risk versus reward if I fix the

48
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:50,380
elevator epic story I can tell at a bar

49
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,149
right if I don't fix the elevator

50
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,729
somebody dies I opted on then let's not

51
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,930
kill randos side so anyway when I

52
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,160
applied for the bar in New York they

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,409
give you this like character and fitness

54
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,670
form because god forbid if we ever had a

55
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:09,429
lawyer who wasn't an upstanding citizen

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:15,880
they rights if we get promoted worked

57
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:18,730
for my dad the question they asked me on

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,590
this form included did you have any

59
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,988
disciplinary history in an education

60
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,650
going back to middle school coming back

61
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,970
to middle school I was like it like that

62
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,049
so if I wrote like a swear word on the

63
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,920
board in middle school you want to talk

64
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,440
about it you want to like have a

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,910
conversation about that time I did that

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,290
and I realized I had this bad

67
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,850
relationship with my high school and I

68
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,630
have no idea what's actually in my

69
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,340
student record little did I realize that

70
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,530
so much of that was gonna be taking up

71
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,640
so much of my life and you you know your

72
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,870
school experience was bad when you

73
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,000
dedicate the rest of your life to

74
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,280
messing with schools what you like

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,390
I bet my high school principal if he

76
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,040
still alive feels really good about

77
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,988
himself right now so let's talk about

78
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,578
FERPA Family Educational Rights and

79
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,700
Privacy Act a law that nobody knows a

80
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,870
whole lot about and I should pause and

81
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
say one thing we're not going to talk

82
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,830
about right now is federal FOIA

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,350
but there's a flier on the door for a

84
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,930
session in Budapest I want to say it's

85
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,920
what was it 5 o'clock tomorrow check the

86
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,260
door because I could be wrong with

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,429
memories 7 to 9 thank you if you'd 7:00

88
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,570
to 9:00 tomorrow either there'll be a

89
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,250
workshop on federal 4 you should

90
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,180
absolutely go to we're gonna talk a

91
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,500
little bit about state Freedom of

92
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,260
Information Law they're not a whole lot

93
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,700
because this is its own separate entity

94
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,440
the Family Educational Rights and

95
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,579
Privacy Act and when you see it in the

96
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,920
media what they talk about

97
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,670
if ferp is used as a reason not to give

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,679
you something right they'll say well

99
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,799
we'd like to tell you what happened but

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,320
we can't because of FERPA and this is an

101
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,730
abuse I've seen so many times that you

102
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,410
can't imagine the lack of consciousness

103
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,760
that some people have about this there

104
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,770
was a high school where a student lost

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,560
his life somehow he they found him

106
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,420
rolled up in a gym mat and the theory is

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
that he was on the bleachers and fell

108
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,299
off the bleachers and landed in the

109
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,680
rolled-up mats and then was upside down

110
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,620
and couldn't get out and just died and

111
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,910
they have these security cameras the

112
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,220
family wanted to see the security

113
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,269
footage of their son's death and the

114
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,560
school says we can't give you that

115
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,510
because of FERPA which is wrong and a

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,260
lot of legal levels obviously on a moral

117
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,820
level is wrong the the interesting thing

118
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,890
about this is that this is not why FERPA

119
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,800
exists the primary purpose of FERPA was

120
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,880
not to withhold records FERPA was passed

121
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,200
in late 1974 and it was reaction to

122
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,460
nixon's plumbers who speaking of lawyers

123
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,280
who are fine upstanding citizen some of

124
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,520
them maybe this is why we have a

125
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,250
questionnaire nixon's plumbers would go

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,419
to like Daniel Ellsberg psychiatrist's

127
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,000
office trying to find information about

128
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,799
him they would try to dig up things from

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,020
people's past so they could say terrible

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,160
things about you which I guess in you

131
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,969
know nineteen early nineteen seventies

132
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,010
were I don't know you you said something

133
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,490
nice about the Soviets at one point or I

134
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,490
don't know

135
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,900
but in order to prevent abuses like this

136
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,090
in the future they wanted to make a law

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,679
that

138
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,210
number one would let you inspect your

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,070
education records to see what people had

140
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,830
written down about you and the easiest

141
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,719
way to analogize this is you were a

142
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,159
Seinfeld episode with Elaine and the

143
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,330
doctors and the doctors all wrote things

144
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,880
in her files you couldn't see what it

145
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,560
was but you couldn't get a doctor

146
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,180
well we fixed that with HIPPA saying you

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,910
have a right to see your records but

148
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,139
this is the education equivalent is that

149
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,270
you could get through your education

150
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,100
career and find out that schools aren't

151
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,299
accepting you College don't accept you

152
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,040
graduate programs are accepting them you

153
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,690
don't know why until you actually look

154
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,479
at the education records your prior

155
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,710
school has sent to your to your next

156
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,570
school and you'll find out sometimes

157
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,950
that there's a letter in there from your

158
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,940
principal or from or from your Dean

159
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,280
saying I don't think you should admit

160
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,500
this person because they're a bad moral

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,820
character or sometimes it'll be more

162
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,990
specific sometimes they'll just be wrong

163
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,460
so the the purpose they don't talk about

164
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,410
is the right to access these records

165
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,609
right so let's talk about what do you

166
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,210
have to do to actually access your

167
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,860
records under FERPA there's not a lot of

168
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,359
formality involved you have to make a

169
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,800
request that could be understand as a

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,850
request to inspect your education record

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,760
and going back to this my my sartorial

172
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,590
tastes here if I were to dress up like

173
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,289
you know a proper professional lawyer

174
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,380
and I went in with my briefcase which I

175
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:39,270
assume I have now and I and I handed

176
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,860
them my written form which will get you

177
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,419
later saying I want to inspect my

178
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,680
education records they have an

179
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,570
obligation let me inspect my education

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,650
records if on the other hand I wear a

181
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:52,700
leopard print speedo and I go into the

182
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,979
place while making gorilla noises I

183
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,820
unwrap a Big Mac and then in ketchup

184
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,510
right FERPA with a question mark

185
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,280
technically that would trigger their

186
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,900
obligation because it could be

187
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,469
understand I could be understood as a

188
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,340
requester inspect my education records

189
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:13,710
so what what do they have to do they

190
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,419
have 45 days from the date of your

191
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,770
request and that's 45 days counting on

192
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,270
the calendar and if you land on a

193
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,510
weekend to go forward till you're not on

194
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:25,409
a weekend or a holiday to give you

195
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,770
access to your records now I say access

196
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,770
to because

197
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:34,580
FERPA was not written in the belief that

198
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,750
schools would be trying to game it what

199
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,150
when they were writing for a per their

200
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,410
concern was third parties trying to get

201
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,169
your information to use it against you

202
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,580
right or third parties putting incorrect

203
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,660
information in your file that would be

204
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,510
used against you whether you knew it or

205
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:51,230
not the senators really weren't focusing

206
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,490
on the idea that the schools would

207
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,670
actually be trying to gain the system to

208
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,980
stop you from getting your records and

209
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,419
partly reason they do this this is a

210
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,130
little cul-de-sac we have to go down I

211
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,840
don't think school administrators are

212
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,159
evil I think they're like a lot of us

213
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,210
and that they want to get from the

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
beginning of the day to the end of the

215
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,830
day with as little suffering as possible

216
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,870
and there aren't a lot of people who

217
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,070
request their FERPA records as like on a

218
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,630
national level if you go to a small of

219
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,460
school they may not have had a flipper

220
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,570
request in their memory because people

221
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,560
just don't do it that often because they

222
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,490
don't know about the law because why

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
would they teach you about this law

224
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,640
because it's a pain for them if you do

225
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,050
it so they tend to view school nurses

226
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,860
tend to view a request to access your

227
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,479
FERPA records as a hostile act and

228
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,770
occasionally it is a hostile act I mean

229
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,909
there are times where the reason why you

230
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,799
want to inspect your FERPA record is

231
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,939
because you've been through a

232
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,459
disciplinary process where you were

233
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,419
acquitted right because this happens you

234
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,600
know let's say you're you're brought up

235
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,920
and you're accused of cheating you go

236
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
through the process and they determine

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,729
you weren't cheating great but I want to

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,400
know what are you saying about this

239
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,630
process in my record because it doesn't

240
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,370
help me if I'm applying to graduate

241
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,750
program or from applying to the bar if

242
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,150
you give them my record which says oh

243
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,170
he's a great student we found that he

244
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,319
wasn't cheating the three times we

245
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,910
looked into it it's like oh thanks you

246
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,370
know it's a great it's a great

247
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,660
recommendation it's it's like it's like

248
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,650
having a long line of strippers willing

249
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:16,730
tell your girlfriend all faithful you

250
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:18,350
are Thanks so you might want to inspect

251
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,360
your records and so they tend to view

252
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,560
that as you're trying to get them in

253
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,370
trouble sometimes you know you just want

254
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,199
to see what's there because you don't

255
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,460
know what's there or because as I said

256
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,750
you were like me you were a complicated

257
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,570
student I don't know for a fact that

258
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,560
they wrote nasty things about me but if

259
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,110
they didn't it's only because they had

260
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,739
limited English skills and they wasted

261
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,740
their time reading fiction

262
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,839
so the school administrators will try to

263
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,370
frustrate your access just out of a

264
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,350
sense of your inconvenient to me and I

265
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,370
want you to go away

266
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,940
the simplest way in which they'll try to

267
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,500
do this is technically speaking the

268
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,870
letter of FERPA does not require them to

269
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,699
give you a copy of your records it

270
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,880
requires them to let you inspect your

271
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:00,349
records at a public institution this

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,620
doesn't matter because every state has a

273
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,389
FOIA law once the personal privacy

274
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,620
exemption is eliminated because it's

275
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,639
your record do you have a right to see

276
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,190
your own record there's no privacy

277
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,959
problem you can get your record from a

278
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,100
public institution under your state's

279
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:18,349
FOIA law I mean you can get a copy of it

280
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,480
the problem is that private institutions

281
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,829
where you don't have that so I want to

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,420
talk about a couple of problems I've

283
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,880
seen with private institutions one of

284
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,290
them is is I don't want to call any

285
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,699
institutions out except for the really

286
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,339
bad ones like to lane to Lane has told

287
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:37,189
students you can come in to see your

288
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,509
record we know it'll take us however

289
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,839
many weeks to get it together we will

290
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:44,750
put it in our basement which is an

291
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,709
air-conditioned and as long as you want

292
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,149
to spend in our on air-conditioned

293
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:52,719
basement inspecting your records you can

294
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:54,920
do that that is not great obviously

295
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,000
another institution and again it don't

296
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:03,259
want to call anybody out American

297
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,040
University don't want to but I kind of

298
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:10,459
got to because they're the bad people

299
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,259
they told one student they wouldn't give

300
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:14,119
him access to his record unless he paid

301
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:16,220
for the copies of the transcription the

302
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,920
transcription was already made and they

303
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,399
wanted him to pay half the caught

304
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,389
fifteen hundred dollars to access the

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,470
existing transcription well that's

306
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:29,149
that's clearly illegal under FERPA what

307
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,949
what FERPA says is in terms of cost they

308
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,209
can charge you the cost of reproduction

309
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,040
they can't charge you to search for the

310
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,930
records and they can't charge you to

311
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,920
access the records they can't charge you

312
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,599
look at the record they can't charge you

313
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,709
to correct the records if you would get

314
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,779
a copy they can charge you for the

315
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,680
actual cost of the copying since they

316
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,720
don't have to actually give you a copy

317
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,829
of course at a private school that's of

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,330
questionable value

319
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,620
Oh another way in which I've seen this

320
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,880
frustrated and this school I actually

321
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,410
won't call out because I'm just not a

322
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,510
sure I remember which one it is it could

323
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,469
be one of three it's you know there's

324
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,029
some schools there like that all the

325
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,399
same name it's like very close to it

326
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,079
I just feel like maybe we at some point

327
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,860
started phoning it in with college names

328
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,910
I mean like well the worst one in this

329
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,529
this isn't the school I'm talking about

330
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,819
in terms of Furth but like University of

331
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:16,230
Maryland University College you got like

332
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,160
six words in your name two of them are

333
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,589
articles and three more the same I mean

334
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,600
come on guys this I hope I hope you have

335
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,850
a creative arts program because not I

336
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:33,180
don't want that degree College

337
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:38,630
University home of the team anyway FERPA

338
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,630
yes I remember that's why I'm here okay

339
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:47,160
one problem one problem in accessing the

340
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:49,439
records would be no they won't collect

341
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,899
them for you now they're supposed to

342
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,130
collect them if I go to any person who

343
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:58,350
is an employee of the institution they

344
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,850
have an obligation to fulfill my FERPA

345
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,110
request and the obligation by the way

346
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,600
this is the Department of Education of

347
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,610
forces it and the failure to abide by it

348
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
is the law could result in the loss of

349
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,910
all federal funding so it applies to any

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,109
institution that gets federal funding

351
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,160
which is basically every educational

352
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,170
institution in the country anymore I

353
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,079
think even Bob Jones is taking student

354
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,740
loans now they have an obligation to

355
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,029
comply with FERPA one way in which

356
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,890
they'll that some schools will try to

357
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:27,510
frustrate this is they'll say well we're

358
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,529
gonna give you your records you ask the

359
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,000
Registrar we're gonna give you the

360
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,860
records the Registrar has but just FYI

361
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,899
there may be records other people have I

362
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,190
don't know legally that doesn't meet

363
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,890
their obligation obligation to give me

364
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,600
my records when I ask for my records

365
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,279
also this creates a problem in that you

366
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,769
don't necessarily know who has all the

367
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,810
records that named you and this became a

368
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:50,760
specific problem when there was a

369
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,479
student at a school where he was that

370
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,010
the school had it had come up with a it

371
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,390
was functionally a bias response team I

372
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,490
don't if you're familiar with bias

373
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,180
response teams but this is like says

374
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,830
someone

375
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,040
said something that that might have been

376
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,770
racist somewhere so I don't know you you

377
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,640
put up the racism signal and they fly in

378
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,110
or something I don't know what they're

379
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,210
supposed to do it's like people are

380
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,670
racist sometimes and welcome to welcome

381
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,450
to the world like seriously we're think

382
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,380
what are they gonna do when they get

383
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,060
there they're gonna be like hey stop it

384
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,950
well that's a good use of our Education

385
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,939
Funding thank you for that when it

386
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,040
wouldn't occur to me to just tell him to

387
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,149
stop it but they had they have these

388
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,110
response teams in there was a guy who

389
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:34,310
was a military veteran and got him to

390
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,540
some dispute with his institution over

391
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,529
there was a there was a veterans group

392
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,329
and there were two veterans who were

393
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,860
struggling for control of the group and

394
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,149
one of the veterans said no this guy

395
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,190
said he was gonna do something bad to me

396
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:47,100
so we got investigated by one of these

397
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,720
teams the problem was the school didn't

398
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,820
acknowledge the existence of the team

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,709
openly he only found out accidentally

400
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,660
and indirectly where someone said well

401
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,920
the team investigated and found it was

402
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,620
fine is like the team what team like

403
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,750
oops so he knows that there's records

404
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,540
about him in the hands of a team the

405
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,740
composition of which he doesn't know but

406
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,150
he knows that some administrators in

407
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,440
this school so he asked to see his

408
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,339
records and the school said well you're

409
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,010
gonna have to request him from the

410
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,060
people who have them Chris doesn't know

411
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,990
who has the records cause he didn't know

412
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,790
is on the team so number one that's

413
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,350
legally insufficient but number two well

414
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,060
if they really want to play this game

415
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,350
like I could send a record I could send

416
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,250
this request to every single person in

417
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,330
the school if you want me to but then

418
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,380
they're all gonna have an independent

419
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,940
obligation to have me inspect those

420
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,100
records and if any one of them fails to

421
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,970
it meet that obligation then you could

422
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,959
get in trouble with the Department of

423
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,540
Education it's like why would you want

424
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,219
to obligate yourself to 3,000 Ripper

425
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:44,339
requests instead of one when the risk of

426
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,900
failure is so dire so let's say you get

427
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,810
to the record let's let's let's say you

428
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,250
know you actually get your record or you

429
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,650
go to Tulane and they put you in in the

430
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,760
basement room and you're sweating it out

431
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,170
down there I don't know if they'll let

432
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,220
you bring in liquid or not I assume you

433
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,229
can drink down there and it's probably

434
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,230
not that bad yep

435
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,090
the question is do schools disallow

436
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,190
photos of the records like if you took

437
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,900
out your cell phone I've heard that from

438
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,310
some schools that they will actually try

439
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,500
to stop you from taking pictures of the

440
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,170
record and their explanation will be

441
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,790
sometimes be that there's other peoples

442
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,839
there's other people's FERPA records in

443
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,730
your FERPA records just a hell of an

444
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,960
interesting catch-22 the record relates

445
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,000
to you but it relates to someone else

446
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,200
you you see this less anymore because

447
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,940
the Department of Education has started

448
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,200
to intervene and tell them this is not

449
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:39,740
how this is not of the world works but I

450
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,000
think was as late as 10 years ago the

451
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,460
position of the Department of Education

452
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,170
was that if you had two students and

453
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:53,240
student aid punches student B student B

454
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,650
wouldn't necessarily be allowed to see

455
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,230
the full record of the investigation

456
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,030
because it would name student a it's

457
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,920
like well student a or and and and this

458
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,839
happens a lot even in in like elementary

459
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,670
schools and middle schools because

460
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,750
you'll have a parent who says my kid

461
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,490
came home and got punched in the face

462
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,450
and I want to know who punched my kid

463
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,240
and they're gonna say oh we can't tell

464
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,319
you because and the Department of

465
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,670
Education I started to push back on that

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,079
have been like listen guys try to be a

467
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,750
little bit rational about this stuff

468
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,859
also in that instance the name of the

469
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,410
kid who punched your kid actually does

470
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,409
relate specifically to your kid that's

471
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,530
part of that record so they can react

472
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,190
names of witnesses the and and I guess

473
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,810
we should talk a little bit about

474
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,640
actually cuz you're talking about the

475
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,520
ability to take pictures of the written

476
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,390
records but the record in the

477
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,030
regulations is anything any recorded

478
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,740
information so if they have pictures if

479
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,030
they have emails now here's here's the

480
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,950
wrinkle there's really two parts to this

481
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,700
test as does something a FERPA record is

482
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,750
something an education record one is it

483
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,980
has to be maintained by the institution

484
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,140
which will circle back to in a minute

485
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,180
and the other is that it must make you

486
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,090
identifiable so it's not just things

487
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,710
that have your name on them it's things

488
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,810
that would single you out as an

489
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:11,210
individual like when I was in high

490
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:12,409
school with they there was there was two

491
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,880
Jewish kids in the school there was me

492
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,290
and my sister and so if it was a male

493
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,910
Jewish student it was me

494
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,020
I went to school in the middle of

495
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,280
nowhere in Ohio it was near Amish

496
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,960
country it was not an exciting place

497
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,500
that's why you read a lot of science

498
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,820
fiction and one time we did terrible

499
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,820
things to the cheese museum but that

500
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,800
that's not my student record because

501
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,920
they never caught me so like that's

502
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,200
right like my student ran the really

503
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,100
shocking thing is is you know that if

504
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,300
there was one thing you knew about me

505
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,530
that they were totally shocked you it's

506
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,860
that when you list the the deadly sins

507
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm guilty of gluttony he's like fourth

508
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:52,580
didn't even crack the top three anyway

509
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,930
maintained by the institution the record

510
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,449
has to be maintained by the institution

511
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,650
so what does that mean well where this

512
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,320
becomes interesting is in the case of

513
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:04,880
emails our emails in your professor's

514
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,090
email box maintained by the institution

515
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,290
and it depends the the key question is

516
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,870
could the professor delete it whenever

517
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,730
they want to if there's no records

518
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,679
retention rule that says they can't just

519
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,030
delete emails then they're not really

520
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,160
being maintained they're just sort of

521
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:23,360
there and also one thing that isn't

522
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,770
considered maintained by the institution

523
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,939
are notes that are for personal

524
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,129
recollection that aren't distributed to

525
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,990
other people so if for whatever reason

526
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,310
your professor has like a folder with a

527
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,900
bunch of information you think is about

528
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,340
you but they've never shown it to anyone

529
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,920
it's kind of like the tree falling in

530
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,949
the forest you don't get that as a FERPA

531
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,240
record because if they're not showing it

532
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,550
to anyone then it's unavailable anybody

533
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,170
else one thing I want to talk about in

534
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,500
this and I skipping around a lot I know

535
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,740
because because I'm nervous because you

536
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:01,250
you all look like ghosts from here and

537
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:03,350
ghosts are scary is that the law

538
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,770
enforcement units of educational

539
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:09,649
institutions aren't considered part of

540
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,940
the institution for purposes of FERPA so

541
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,230
if you say I want to see all my records

542
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,940
in the possession of the institution

543
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,980
you're not going to see things that are

544
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,940
in possession of campus security or

545
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,140
campus alone for even if they're not

546
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,740
sworn law enforcement even if they're

547
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,270
basically mall cops with fancier patches

548
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,810
the their records are still considered

549
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:31,070
not part of the institution

550
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:32,929
and this does actually create a weird

551
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,750
dichotomy when it comes to student

552
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,280
discipline records because how you know

553
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,260
your ability to access their records

554
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,149
they have about you is gonna vary

555
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,040
depending on how they decide to treat

556
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,230
the investigation of what you did and

557
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,129
there's no rhyme or reason whatsoever to

558
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,450
this I mean there's no logic to it like

559
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,610
you'll have there'll be some schools

560
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:57,230
where they'll have campus security you

561
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,379
know in investigate illegal downloading

562
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,760
while they have like the campus

563
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:07,130
disciplinary board investigating sexual

564
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,360
assaults I never understood like is this

565
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,860
really a good place for amateurs to

566
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,080
dabble in investigations you want to

567
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:16,879
start them there can't work them up from

568
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,040
like traffic violations but in that case

569
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,570
then the records of the sexual assault

570
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,490
investigation would be accessible versus

571
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,110
what would be accessible under FERPA but

572
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,490
the records of the illegal downloading

573
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,530
wouldn't be because they're in the hands

574
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,720
of campus law enforcement now depending

575
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,010
on the state you're in campus law

576
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,360
enforcement records may be available

577
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,350
under regular FOIA and once again

578
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,600
there's no rhyme or reason that just

579
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,530
depends on which state judge happened to

580
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,030
get the question and how they were

581
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,139
feeling that day and whether they

582
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:48,350
considered it you know useful I mean an

583
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,030
engine as a general matter if your

584
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,000
campus law enforcement has sworn

585
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,129
officers in most places not

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,820
Massachusetts or Connecticut but in most

587
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,990
places that creates an obligation to

588
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,280
turn over records because if you have

589
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,200
the ability to handcuff someone to

590
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,050
entertain them you probably have an

591
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,990
obligation to tell people you did it or

592
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,940
else you're just kidnapping them so

593
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,170
that's not in Massachusetts in

594
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,040
Connecticut you can just kidnap people

595
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,160
if you're give your campus law

596
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,629
enforcement so consider that when you're

597
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,070
deciding where you're going for where

598
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,360
you're gonna go to graduate school and

599
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,409
how likely you are to interact with

600
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,409
campus police when you go there

601
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:33,440
one important piece to this is one of

602
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,210
the obligations imposed on the

603
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,580
institution is they have to maintain a

604
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:42,310
record of requests to see your records

605
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:45,080
and they have to list when they

606
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:50,030
acquiesced to those requests and the

607
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,889
rationale for why they did it there's a

608
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,570
bunch of little exceptions in FERPA for

609
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:58,270
people or allowed to see your records if

610
00:22:53,570 --> 00:23:00,230
you are a dependent of your parents

611
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,580
presently not at the time you attended

612
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,570
if you're presently a dependent of your

613
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,980
parents and they're paying the bills

614
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,800
they can see financial records related

615
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,510
to you there's certain records that

616
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,240
their schools are allowed to turn over

617
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,410
to law enforcement without permission

618
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:22,250
this is another great example of FERPA

619
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:26,420
abuse actually Oklahoma State hey oh boy

620
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,770
I you know that I don't normally believe

621
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,740
in content warnings but this is an ugly

622
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:33,710
story so I apologize in advance because

623
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:37,730
it's a it's about a serial sexual sex

624
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,260
offender Oklahoma State had five male

625
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,330
students come forward and say that

626
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,850
during an on-campus orientation they

627
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,590
called camp cowboy which really shades a

628
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:49,330
Penn State right there they had been

629
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:51,199
sexually assaulted by one of the

630
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,260
students who was acting as sort of a

631
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,240
counselor for this orientation the

632
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,470
school had private disciplinary hearings

633
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,760
and determined that they believe that

634
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,500
four of the five guys were credible

635
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,400
which I thought was the most astonishing

636
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,710
part of the story to me we know that the

637
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,410
fifth guy just wants to be cool

638
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:14,140
like like I mean like you know you know

639
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:20,650
guys are always bragging about that

640
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:24,080
anyway the school then suspended the

641
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,640
offender for six semesters I believe cuz

642
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,699
that was when his last victim would have

643
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,080
graduated and then didn't tell anybody

644
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,790
didn't tell law enforcement so that

645
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,980
fifth guy who wasn't believed went to

646
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,250
the campus paper the campus paper went

647
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,810
to the city cops and the city cop said

648
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,240
nobody told us this happened

649
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:45,770
and the school said well we didn't tell

650
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,810
you because of FERPA there's there's two

651
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:53,030
things I want to say about this one is

652
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:54,610
that it's very clear on the life or

653
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,070
purposes that if you believe there is a

654
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:00,409
threat to safety or security nothing in

655
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,389
FERPA prevents an employee of an

656
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,300
institution from reporting that threat

657
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,220
to any authority as necessary whether

658
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,690
that's federal state anybody who might

659
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,770
be able to intervene the other thing I

660
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,990
want to say is you shouldn't need to be

661
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,000
told that even if FERPA said you

662
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,830
couldn't do that I would say by all

663
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,870
means come take away my federal funding

664
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,020
I'm not gonna just let rapists wander

665
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,489
around because because an education

666
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,110
regulation said it might be convenient

667
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,970
I think this that's not a good enough

668
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,350
reason for me so anyone kept when when

669
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,600
the police did investigate they found

670
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,949
like a dozen other victims because of

671
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,409
course they did because who stopped at

672
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:39,460
four at that point it's a lifestyle

673
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:42,500
choice so he ultimately obviously got

674
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,270
okay well deferred prosecution because

675
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,400
he went he went to counseling at his

676
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,450
church but whatever that's a that's

677
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,060
another problem with what's wrong with

678
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:54,110
things that's not a FERPA problem

679
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,970
the point being one is that this is a

680
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,439
way people abused for but it surprises

681
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,180
the other the other thing is that they

682
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,290
might have disclosed your records to law

683
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,820
enforcement without telling you because

684
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,050
they thought for whatever reason you

685
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,500
might have been a threat to someone or

686
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:09,830
others it is it is entirely possible I

687
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,450
haven't seen it but I know I haven't

688
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,439
seen it because then it's happening the

689
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,790
the point of this is that it's happening

690
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,730
in secret so how would I see it

691
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,840
for an institution to decide that you

692
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,910
are somehow a threat to national

693
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,919
security so they go and they tell the

694
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,210
Secret Service the Secret Service

695
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,230
investigates you and decides you're not

696
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,090
a threat to national security

697
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,310
and now there's a record in your file

698
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,970
saying that oh you might be a threat to

699
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,800
national security

700
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,300
and Secret Service has a file on you and

701
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,149
you've you've been told nothing and you

702
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,290
have no awareness that this exists

703
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,480
you'll you'll find out when you apply

704
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,350
for your job at the FBI then you fail

705
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,550
your background check and you're like

706
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,550
what happened um

707
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,019
this log is supposed to be kept with

708
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,330
their education records this access log

709
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,610
it isn't necessarily always because

710
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:59,309
schools are inconsistent observers of

711
00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:00,658
purpose regulations in making a FERPA

712
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:01,830
request if you know what you're looking

713
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,350
for it may not be necessary to ask for

714
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,199
this access log if you know that what I

715
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,399
want is that time I was accused of

716
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,440
plagiarism I want I want those

717
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,699
investigation records you can say I want

718
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,110
the records about you know at the

719
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,789
Student Conduct hearing on these dates

720
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,080
give me those records if you don't

721
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,029
necessarily know what you're looking for

722
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,178
you're just trying to see is there

723
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:22,769
something in there you actually want to

724
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,120
specifically request that access log

725
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:25,769
because that will tell you if they've

726
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,090
they've disclosed the information to law

727
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,039
enforcement the only things that

728
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,658
wouldn't be in that access log is if

729
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,299
they thought you were you were engaged

730
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:35,429
in terrorism or there was a grand jury

731
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,519
subpoena those are the two exemptions to

732
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,630
the access log so if you're engaged in

733
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,830
terrorism in this grand jury subpoena

734
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,019
about you this is not the best use of

735
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,230
your time by the way well you should

736
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:49,889
probably be leaving the country like

737
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:52,679
this arguing about your student record

738
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:54,120
not a priority but that's let's talk

739
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,139
about argument so let's say you get your

740
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,320
record you find out there's something

741
00:27:55,139 --> 00:28:03,299
completely bogus in it they say you know

742
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,379
you well shoot they they say you you

743
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,789
you're a threat to national security

744
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,720
which is completely buggin and the

745
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:12,658
reason I keep bringing that one up is

746
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:15,169
because indulge me for 45 seconds I want

747
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,000
to give you some some some life advice

748
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,769
the the greatest skill I have other than

749
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,240
the ability to eat buffalo wings and

750
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:25,409
spit out the bones without actually to

751
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:29,090
my hands is that I mean that's that's

752
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:29,090
pretty bragging right thank you right

753
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:35,439
next hope look for it in the schedule

754
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,940
it's gonna be next to the lockpick area

755
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,409
downstairs I'll just be stick going for

756
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,779
distance and the bones anyway but next

757
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:42,460
to that my greatest skill is the ability

758
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:45,700
to interview people and ask them

759
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,740
questions and get answers and one of the

760
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,549
things I always impress on people when

761
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,220
I'm teaching them how to ask questions

762
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,418
is the value of silence especially if

763
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,830
you're recording it or in a situation

764
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:55,120
like this if you ask someone a question

765
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,100
and you don't get the answer you want

766
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,899
just don't say anything and just let

767
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,879
silence sit for a minute because a lot

768
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,080
of people will feel and come they'll

769
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,100
feel uncomfortable about the silence

770
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,260
especially if they're withholding

771
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,779
something and an example of this is I

772
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,640
had an intern who went on to write for

773
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:12,279
the Yale Daily News and I expressed this

774
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,140
to him and he was investigating an odd

775
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,039
story on campus where a guy just

776
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,740
vanished don't know where he went and he

777
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,610
called the Dean of Students and so today

778
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,309
I'm just looking at this guy's

779
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,639
disappearance is do you ever think about

780
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,320
that

781
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,779
and the Dean of Students said I can't

782
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,720
tell you anything about that so he just

783
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,980
said nothing he's waited and the Dean of

784
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,159
Students said the Secret Service told me

785
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,159
not to

786
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,760
you'd have to be journalists but to know

787
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,659
that when the explanation is I can't

788
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,220
answer your question cuz the Secret

789
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,470
Service told me not to there may be some

790
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,550
story there and it actually happened was

791
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,950
they found out the guy who had to head

792
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,139
stolen an identity basically he had he

793
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,610
had a really odd name that was happened

794
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,750
to be shared by one other person the

795
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,639
other person that he had been going to

796
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,230
Columbia and he had transferred into

797
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,050
Yale using that person's Columbia record

798
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,460
without telling anybody and then just

799
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,110
before he graduated he broke up with his

800
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,870
boyfriend and his boyfriend ratted him

801
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:08,409
out and the school turned him in so

802
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,580
don't break up with your boyfriend

803
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,680
before graduation if you stole an

804
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,740
identity you learned a lot here this is

805
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,360
gold where where else in your life have

806
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:22,240
you ever gotten that advice and yet it's

807
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:24,000
so valuable so that anyway this thing

808
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,170
about silence and asking questions and

809
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,400
what do you do when you see something on

810
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,690
your record let there's a list of why I

811
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
keep going back to the threat to

812
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,180
national security because the Secret

813
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,290
Service was and was investigating that

814
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,990
and I keep thinking about there's

815
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,460
there's an interesting example so you

816
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,840
find out in your record they say that

817
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,970
you you were a threat to national

818
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,530
security you were investigated and the

819
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,060
results were inconclusive that's the

820
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,350
first you hear about it is is you've

821
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,850
asked to inspect your records and you

822
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,550
got the copy of them / you went to the

823
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:50,230
basement and you take a picture of it

824
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,300
what do you do about the fact that your

825
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,860
record is wrong

826
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,020
FERPA says you have a right to a hearing

827
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,399
in fact the regulations actually

828
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,389
stipulate a few things about how this

829
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,190
hearing has to be conducted

830
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:05,200
unfortunately some of the stipulations

831
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:08,860
are mushy and aspirational like like a

832
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
reasonable time from now not everybody

833
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,729
agrees on what's reasonable as I'm sure

834
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
you know you've discovered in your

835
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:19,330
relationships reasonable it's pretty

836
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,010
subjective but some things are actually

837
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,840
objective and one of them is you have to

838
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:26,050
be in front of a neutral decision-maker

839
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,310
with no interest in the outcome and you

840
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:32,560
have to be given a full and fair chance

841
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:33,850
to be heard so whoa this alone means the

842
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,320
person you are appealing to cannot be

843
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,439
the person who wrote what's in that file

844
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,090
but can't be the person who was a

845
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,250
witness to what's in that file it has to

846
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,169
be somebody was neutral it has to be

847
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,840
somebody who if they found in your favor

848
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,710
wouldn't be wouldn't be viewed in a

849
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,529
negative light like if if the

850
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,950
who is overseeing this is the guy who's

851
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,690
the head of the the panel that said you

852
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,799
were a threat that's not a full and fair

853
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,340
chance to be heard because the panel

854
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,929
said you were a threat before and then

855
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,279
they have to issue an opinion in a

856
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,940
reasonable time whatever that means I

857
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,679
mean reasonableness

858
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,390
for the most part of the argument I

859
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,860
would make is if it takes 45 days to

860
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,000
inspect the record 45 days ought to be a

861
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,860
pretty reasonable period for issuing

862
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,070
issuing a panel ruling on these things

863
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,809
if they find that if they find in your

864
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,689
favor that this information should not

865
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:27,200
be in your record it's gone they take it

866
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:29,870
out if they don't find it in your favor

867
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
you still have a right to write

868
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,110
something and have it included in the

869
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,940
record actually you have the right to

870
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,110
submit any record you so if you want to

871
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,620
like sing a song about it

872
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:42,229
you know do do some some crayon artwork

873
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,629
and put that in there you can do that or

874
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,250
you make make a video of you saying this

875
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:53,419
is this is bogus you have a right to do

876
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:54,890
that too so that right to it to amend

877
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,559
the record at that point is absolute you

878
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,940
can write whatever you want there so

879
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,408
even if you lose the hearing you still

880
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,149
get the ability to say by the way this

881
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:04,490
is completely bogus this guy had it in

882
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:05,870
for me now obviously within the bounds

883
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,399
of defamation law there's probably some

884
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,928
limit to what you can say about that

885
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:11,529
this guy had it in for me and he

886
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:14,120
strangles dogs for sexual pleasure I

887
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,740
don't that may not be great I mean I

888
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,270
want to write that but like this guy had

889
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,190
it in for me and he never liked me and

890
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,230
he's always been biased against me and I

891
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,539
think he probably doesn't doesn't like

892
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:30,380
anybody of my race or demographic might

893
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:32,870
be okay substantively that's that's what

894
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,279
I had to cover so questions concerns

895
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,939
comments threats I'll tell you one thing

896
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:42,850
about this I'm doing a workshop at 3:00

897
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,850
in Paris the room Paris

898
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:51,330
and I've got a form that consolidates a

899
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,470
lot of these things into one legally

900
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,659
cognizable form it's slightly better

901
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:58,620
than a Burger King wrapper I'd like to

902
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:02,310
think there's also like I say that but

903
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,719
it's like nobody practices FERPA law so

904
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,009
it's like there's like two dozen experts

905
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,000
in the world I mean really realistically

906
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,930
would any of you know if I just made

907
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,210
this law up entirely this one thing like

908
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,259
so this is a button this is a record

909
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,460
that is better than anything they've

910
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,900
seen that I've read and I guarantee you

911
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,760
Freeza Freeza views though an access I

912
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,610
threw it up on a little website if you

913
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,890
go to student record org it's available

914
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,120
to download so you're welcome to come to

915
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,319
the workshop if you want help in

916
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,520
submitting these records you can do it

917
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,010
electronically you can do it in print

918
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,000
I've got envelopes and stuff if you

919
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,140
don't want my help and want me to go

920
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
away and shut up you can go to that

921
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,290
website download it and amend that

922
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,900
record however you like before you send

923
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,110
it in so thoughts concerns comments

924
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,730
questions hate mail death threats

925
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:53,190
questions about how I do the buffalo

926
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:56,190
wing thing turn this on so having an

927
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,480
incredibly sketchy educational record as

928
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,240
well I think I've dropped it on more

929
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,220
schools and I've graduated from if I

930
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,450
file a request like this which I'm super

931
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,240
interested in doing is I've got one more

932
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,560
degree left to go that I want to do

933
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,899
might anything bubble to the surface

934
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,500
that I don't want to have bubble to the

935
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,240
surface if I make this kind of a request

936
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,550
yeah the question was if you make the

937
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,979
request is it possible that you might

938
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,100
surface things in here that wouldn't

939
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,740
have come up otherwise the short answer

940
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,810
is not that I've never heard of that I

941
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,459
mean for that to happen I guess it's not

942
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,570
totally impossible here's here's the

943
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,030
here's the Dominos I guess that would

944
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,730
have to happen somebody on campus has a

945
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,710
record about you that's false or

946
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,780
damaging and accurate of Ragno but

947
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,600
somebody on you has this record and it's

948
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,060
not in a centralized location right now

949
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,650
so if that other school requests your

950
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,750
records it may not come back with what

951
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,220
the Registrar has but then by virtue of

952
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,480
filing the request it is possible I

953
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,270
guess they centralized your information

954
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,160
in one place and then now they send that

955
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:59,890
larger file

956
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,220
it's it's sort of unlikely I think for a

957
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,170
bunch of reasons one is that if they're

958
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,430
gonna pull these records for you they're

959
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,339
probably gonna pull them for everybody

960
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,328
it would really require them to have

961
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,470
just two different people on two

962
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,809
different days and one of them does the

963
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,740
job and one of them doesn't do it so

964
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:19,119
it's it's not impossible but I wouldn't

965
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,890
it's pretty unlikely and I would also

966
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,740
say that your access of these records

967
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,788
doesn't go into that log that that log I

968
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,959
was talking about people everyone who

969
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:27,789
access your records gets her name analog

970
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:38,289
that's only true of people other than

971
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:40,119
you so that that cover it I feel your

972
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,289
pain men arguing with Jesuits was it was

973
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,960
great training for being a lawyer though

974
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:47,069
I mean I'm like you know vyas but father

975
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,270
but didn't john carlin lumen say man is

976
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,619
man me believe what he chooses and be

977
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,259
answerable for he chooses to believe and

978
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:57,250
do you believe father that the cardinal

979
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,559
was referring to you so I'm curious

980
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,760
about the intersection of a school's

981
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,960
FERPA obligations and also the school's

982
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,430
self-assured right to decide who goes

983
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,859
there and I have a bit of an anecdote to

984
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,169
go with it which is my University Brown

985
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,240
University has a big list of academic

986
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,069
code violations things they'll kick you

987
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,209
out of school for and sandwiched right

988
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:20,589
in between falsifying your records and

989
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,529
destroying of the students classwork is

990
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:25,420
I quote gaining access to a

991
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,799
recommendation without permission

992
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,799
once rights have been waived

993
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,099
I'm not even totally sure I understand

994
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:35,150
what happened there so we're talking

995
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:36,380
about we're talking about Brown has a

996
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,390
thing that says one things you get in

997
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,039
trouble for is gaining access to what to

998
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,868
one's records uh permission er yeah that

999
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,510
is right up there with cheating it says

1000
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:49,280
it would get in the way of fair grading

1001
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:50,390
procedures apparently Brown says if you

1002
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,089
get access to someone's records without

1003
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,160
permission I mean I sort of wonder like

1004
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:58,029
is by operation of law permission let me

1005
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,129
like that seems pretty permissive to me

1006
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,690
III would take the position that if a

1007
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,480
school were to try to discipline

1008
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,309
somebody under a rule like that for for

1009
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,230
engaging in the use of FERPA that would

1010
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:10,130
be a violation of FERPA which is the

1011
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,770
sort of thing they would lose their

1012
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,260
federal funding for so a little curious

1013
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:18,109
so as a student when I waive the right

1014
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,049
to see my letters of recommendation am i

1015
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:22,430
waiving it in the FERPA sense know the

1016
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,200
question when you waive your right to

1017
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,190
see letters of recommendation are you're

1018
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,529
waiving a right to see them later for

1019
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,599
FERPA no I mean usually when we're

1020
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,980
talking about like I only know about L

1021
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,530
sac and like the in going to law school

1022
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,869
for that but you waive them you you can

1023
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,099
see them after they're sent but you

1024
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:41,059
waive the right to see them before

1025
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:43,460
they're sent well that's well

1026
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:48,140
then I guess the answer is do you know

1027
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:51,619
don't waive it the thing it is it is

1028
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:54,049
kind of bogus but my question is how

1029
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:56,329
does the removal of certain parts of

1030
00:38:54,049 --> 00:39:00,680
your record get affected by different

1031
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:02,359
versions of that record so say I say I

1032
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,078
have a student record that existed my

1033
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:07,910
junior sophomore freshman senior year

1034
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:10,490
and I find out about something after I

1035
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:13,129
graduate what would prevent someone from

1036
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:17,569
pulling an older version of my record

1037
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,710
before something heinous was deleted the

1038
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:20,329
question was about if you correct one

1039
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,130
version of the record in this record

1040
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,720
exists in multiple places how do you

1041
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,750
stop somebody from getting the other

1042
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,038
record there's a simple way to do that I

1043
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,270
mean the good news is that the records

1044
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,650
that are going to affect you are going

1045
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,630
to be the ones that are at that central

1046
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,549
location where you're where you're

1047
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,109
requesting it because I mean I guess it

1048
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:40,038
an example here would be so you have

1049
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:41,390
something in your high school record

1050
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,460
that

1051
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,960
you correct after you've gone to college

1052
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,730
but before you go to graduate school and

1053
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,050
now you've corrected it in high school

1054
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:52,430
but the college has the old high school

1055
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,310
version the you know you might have to

1056
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,419
actually write to the college and say

1057
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,940
here's the amended record I want this

1058
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,990
included they they shouldn't have a big

1059
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,690
issue with that because what are they

1060
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,419
care but like I guess going back to your

1061
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,480
point of you could never know is if you

1062
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,980
just get flatly denied then how do you

1063
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,210
how do you control which version of your

1064
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,890
record they got if you get denied what

1065
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,170
like if you get denied that say say

1066
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,810
you're applying for graduate school and

1067
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:24,010
they just deny you and you never find

1068
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:26,000
out it's because they have an old record

1069
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,950
what course of action do you have then

1070
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,200
the question would be what happens if

1071
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,520
you get denied from you you know you get

1072
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,080
denied it in your graduate school

1073
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,940
application and it turns out ultimately

1074
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,140
it's because your college had your older

1075
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,120
version of the unattractive version of

1076
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,560
high school record I don't think there's

1077
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,299
a simple there's a simple fix for that I

1078
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,779
think this this is a good reason to

1079
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,120
request both hits and look at them both

1080
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,430
because I don't think there'd be any

1081
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,560
damages against the college for having

1082
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,609
the wrong record and the high school I

1083
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,370
don't think it'd be damage against cuz

1084
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:57,080
they corrected it so I think the only

1085
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,330
thing to do is to request it before you

1086
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:04,910
apply and then see if they've got the

1087
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:06,770
older version well thanks thanks so a

1088
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,839
similar to your question actually so I

1089
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,430
just went through the college

1090
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,760
application process and now we go to

1091
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:16,759
college in a month remember that on the

1092
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,910
common app we had to check a box that

1093
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,010
says that we wave our FERPA rights and

1094
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:26,629
if we don't do that we we couldn't

1095
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:27,860
submit the application so from what I

1096
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,460
understood from what my college

1097
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:34,130
counselor said she said that we have to

1098
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:37,130
do this to ensure that we can't read our

1099
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,360
teacher recommendations so I guess I'm

1100
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,420
wondering I guess similar to what you

1101
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,810
asked at what point can I read those and

1102
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,340
how well I the question was about I'm

1103
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,779
not on the Common App and also

1104
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,990
congratulations the question was on the

1105
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,790
Common App thank you if it makes you

1106
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,790
waive your FERPA rights

1107
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,980
and the explanation that you got was

1108
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,759
that it was so you couldn't read your

1109
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,110
recommendations those are probably

1110
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,280
simpler explanation as to why they do

1111
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,080
that I mean that that that may be one

1112
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,520
effect of it but waving your FERPA

1113
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,819
rights they couldn't actually distribute

1114
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,780
your transcripts without that so that if

1115
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,890
you don't wave your FERPA rights they

1116
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,180
actually can't give it give your grades

1117
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,470
either because your FERPA rights also

1118
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,160
say that other people can't distribute

1119
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:18,640
your records when I mean you should be

1120
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,690
able to at any time after that submitted

1121
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,890
request those recommendations and see

1122
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,170
them because you waive those FERPA

1123
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,839
rights with respect to the third party

1124
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,360
company that's assembling these that's

1125
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,980
something too common app right you

1126
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,350
preserve your FERPA rights with the

1127
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,520
institution I mean you there's no way to

1128
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,339
permanently give up your FERPA right

1129
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,710
that I'm aware of so and I should also

1130
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,380
say that those FERPA rights will follow

1131
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,600
you around till you die literally till

1132
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,410
you die dead people don't get FERPA

1133
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,549
rights this comes up every so often

1134
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,850
because you'll have a situation where

1135
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,200
they'll be

1136
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:56,509
I mean sadly like people who go on

1137
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,189
shooting rampages and then either kill

1138
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,360
themselves at the end of them or get or

1139
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,930
they get shot at the end of them and

1140
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,580
people want to go back to see whoa did

1141
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,589
the school know that this person was off

1142
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,180
that they had some problem and did they

1143
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,680
do anything about it and the schools

1144
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,850
will sometimes try to say well we can't

1145
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,149
give you that because it's an education

1146
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:15,920
record and the answer is you know once

1147
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:20,480
you've passed on to the great beyond

1148
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,520
your privacy rights are not your privacy

1149
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,650
rights traveled with you and those

1150
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,790
records are no longer private so anyway

1151
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,230
these these FERPA rights are yours until

1152
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,630
death and you can inspect those records

1153
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,070
anytime after you give them to the yeah

1154
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,950
anytime after they've been sent up to

1155
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:39,800
the the common half people so I could

1156
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,240
just ask my college and they'll hand it

1157
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,800
over through the process they'll just

1158
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,240
hand them over like you you waive your

1159
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,950
right to FERPA with with respect to the

1160
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,359
common app but you can't waive it god

1161
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:51,560
with respect to the ability to inspect

1162
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,730
your record sense of course yeah and I

1163
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,400
should also say this is this is a useful

1164
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,170
thing to say like one weird wrinkle of

1165
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,920
this is your rights under FERPA only

1166
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,720
happen only kick in once you've actually

1167
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,910
matriculated such that like if a school

1168
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,169
rejects you you wouldn't have an ability

1169
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,399
to inspect

1170
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,330
their record of you as to why they

1171
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,030
rejected you because you're not a

1172
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,560
student there but but once I am a

1173
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,470
student there I can actually look at

1174
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,130
what they said about an application

1175
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:20,390
absolutely real if it kept it I mean

1176
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,100
there's known as a digital application

1177
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,640
necessarily keep application materials

1178
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,299
some schools do is substitute don't

1179
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,299
thank you thanks so much

1180
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:34,880
so I've got a question about the like

1181
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,160
the arbitration when you dispute

1182
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,349
something that's on the record sure who

1183
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,868
pays for the arbiter and if you're in a

1184
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:45,140
if you go to a small school or like a

1185
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:47,119
small town there's prep there is a

1186
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,078
chance that there is not someone who

1187
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,690
would be negatively for participating in

1188
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,660
that process and have you if that's the

1189
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,729
case how you get somebody that's neutral

1190
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,118
and how do you who's paying this guy

1191
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:03,680
that's in economics well yeah the

1192
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,170
question was about it in the process to

1193
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,538
correct the record who pays for it pays

1194
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,130
for the process the school pays for the

1195
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,799
process but the school is entitled to

1196
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,940
use any process that hypothetically

1197
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,710
gives you a full and fair chance to be

1198
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,989
heard in front of a neutral

1199
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,309
decision-maker so they don't necessarily

1200
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:21,289
have to be an arbitrator they can get

1201
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:23,180
anybody on campus who they can make a

1202
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:24,680
straight face to argument isn't going to

1203
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:29,660
be impacted by the outcome of the

1204
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,640
decision the table let's say there's a

1205
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,690
great incentive on schools and once

1206
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,308
things have gone this far those real

1207
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,319
incentive on schools to try to do this

1208
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:37,910
right the first time given that they're

1209
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,489
gonna be paying for every time they do

1210
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,920
it so if they were to do it and it turns

1211
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:44,569
out that it wasn't fair and the

1212
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,339
Department of Education and or a court

1213
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:50,989
could order them to you again and again

1214
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:52,729
and again until it you have hair so I've

1215
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:56,420
heard of only one case where I know

1216
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:58,720
where that was an issue involving the

1217
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,760
fine people in

1218
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:05,770
of the New York City public school

1219
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,030
system where where the heat they didn't

1220
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,030
give a full and fair chance to be heard

1221
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:13,240
and and they were told you again thank

1222
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:15,400
you do parents have access to a

1223
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,629
children's surprise especially do

1224
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,000
parents have access to the children's

1225
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:26,859
FERPA rights in high school they do

1226
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:29,349
until the child is is 18 in college it

1227
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,509
doesn't matter how old you are I I went

1228
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:33,310
to college when I was fifteen because

1229
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,540
I'm from the middle of nowhere in Ohio

1230
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:36,640
when I was coming to New York City how

1231
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,410
long do you wanting out in Ohio if

1232
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,348
you've been in Ohio for like 20 minutes

1233
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,160
you've seen Ohio playing me pretty much

1234
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:44,319
all of it

1235
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,770
you know I saw a cow I saw a llama I'm

1236
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,770
done here

1237
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:53,069
oh and I saw the cheese Museum

1238
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:55,769
so I pretty much saw the highlights and

1239
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:57,869
we're pretty much done I'm like I mean

1240
00:46:55,769 --> 00:47:02,609
even LeBron left so you can see how that

1241
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:03,119
I was so mad and he left the first time

1242
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:06,150
man

1243
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,579
I was so salty back that one when he

1244
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,929
first left after after hundred seven

1245
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,910
million dollars in no rings I would tell

1246
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:16,499
a joke I'd say LeBron and I have a lot

1247
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:17,969
in common we both left Cleveland were

1248
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,899
both bald and we don't know who LeBron

1249
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:24,150
James his daddy is

1250
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:26,059
I was salty anyway I'm fine now yeah he

1251
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:32,160
got a title he can go where he wants now

1252
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:34,319
anyway I did you forget the question the

1253
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,979
apparent one yes thank you

1254
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,999
yeah the one accept is that if a student

1255
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:40,618
is a dependent and the parents are

1256
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:43,140
paying the bills the parents have a

1257
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,449
right to see did the economic records of

1258
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,249
the college so stuff about tuition that

1259
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,689
you can send to the parents and that

1260
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:50,218
boils down to are you claimed as a

1261
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:51,899
dependent on your parents tax return

1262
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:54,179
that doesn't give them the right to any

1263
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,179
of your other records just the financial

1264
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:58,380
records so if you're in college the only

1265
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:59,519
records your parents could ever get

1266
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,579
would be your financial records and

1267
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,899
that's only if they're paying your bills

1268
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:07,349
your your tuition I'm not any bills your

1269
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,789
tuition but other than that everybody

1270
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:12,109
who goes to colleges is considered an

1271
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:12,109
adult prefer purposes

1272
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,810
just we're over eight and a half already

1273
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,580
and we're trying to get set over there

1274
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,070
well sorry about that well hope some of

1275
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,799
that was useful come see me at the Paris

1276
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:28,290

1277
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,339
