1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
this is my first hope and I'm having a

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,550
blast I love the message I love the the

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,460
many aspects here that are being drawn

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,610
together and the the unified theme under

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,529
all I think the message that I'm going

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:22,020
to bring is going to mesh very well with

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,820
that and emphasize these themes as

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,490
Thomas mentioned I'm a big promoter of

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,260
amateur radio and and the reasons why

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:35,160
will become clear in a bit throughout

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,430
the weekend that we are sharing here one

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,739
of the the aspects that we observe is

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,829
that all of this technology can be quite

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,199
fragile all of this technology is based

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,960
on one single commodity and that is

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,800
electricity and should anything happen

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,710
to that electricity many things will

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,949
fail in rapid succession there's an

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,640
inherent fragility to the the many

20
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:12,119
things that make our life possible and

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:13,650
and and pleasurable one key experience

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,170
that kind of drove that home for me

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,460
occurred almost exactly twenty-five

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,409
years ago this week it was summer of

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,689
1993 it was a very rainy summer and over

26
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,430
the fourth of July weekend there was six

27
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,820
inches of rain that fell on Northern

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,100
Iowa and it became very apparent shortly

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,100
thereafter that there was a big surge of

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,240
water heading down all of the rivers

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,298
towards where I lived in Quincy Illinois

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,669
and the projections were that the river

33
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,430
was going to crest the levees that

34
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,430
protected our area by at least four feet

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,280
so things had to happen and it was

36
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,579
pointed out to the amateur radio group

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,810
to which I belonged that the power

38
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,689
substation was down in the river bottom

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,449
the telephone relay station was down in

40
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,849
the river bottom and the water pumping

41
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,989
and purification system that provided

42
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,450
water for the entire

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,270
community was down in the cheap real

44
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:23,450
estate in the river bottom and if it got

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,960
flooded all that would go away so

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,179
literally overnight the Army Corps of

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,760
engineer the Illinois Department of

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,460
Transportation the Red Cross Salvation

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,429
Army all these organizations came

50
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,240
together to start sandbagging and raise

51
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,060
that levee within the sky island

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,000
drainage district which that County was

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,150
part of there were over 300 miles of

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,700
levees that had to be raised thousands

55
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,060
of volunteers came forth and it would

56
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,130
have been uttered chaos because there

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,700
was no way to communicate and coordinate

58
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,609
all of them except with a system that

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:11,510
utilized no infrastructure and that was

60
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,510
amateur radio so we had hundreds

61
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,910
hundreds of volunteers with walkie

62
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,600
talkies writing with Red Cross trucks

63
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,090
Corps of engineer trucks in the police

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,460
station in the hospital coordinating the

65
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:31,380
communications that would not happen in

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:35,310
the overloaded phone system and for two

67
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,019
weeks we raised the sandbags and it

68
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,900
rained again and we realized we would

69
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:44,580
have to raise them again we ended up

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,570
raising the levee at eight feet it was

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:53,400
one inch above the level of the final

72
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:55,230
crest of the river and it held the levee

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,760
on the west side of the Mississippi

74
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,350
River did not it was breached ultimately

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,620
it was determined it was an act of

76
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,260
sabotage and the eastern counties of

77
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,360
Missouri for two weeks became the fifth

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,870
largest freshwater lake in North America

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,920
but that drove home the message that

80
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,950
some of these things that we take for

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,460
granted are very fragile and we need to

82
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,139
have plans in mind what we can do to

83
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,198
strengthen them

84
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,569
now one of the are the areas of

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,120
fragility which which I'm going to talk

86
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:37,210
about today actually manifested and

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,569
became part of our awareness many many

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,638
years ago and we begin with what what is

89
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:44,129
known as the Carrington event which

90
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,289
occurred August 1st

91
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:50,349
1859 it was named after Richard

92
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:53,110
Carrington who is an observe astronomer

93
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:55,090
in the Royal Observatory in England who

94
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,659
was looking through a device like this a

95
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:03,400
Helia scope monitoring the sunspots and

96
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:05,139
it projects an image of the Sun on a

97
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,479
screen so you don't actually look at the

98
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:14,229
the the bright rays and as he was

99
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:17,919
looking at the Sun he observed something

100
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:20,560
that was completely had never been seen

101
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,109
before at that time he observed two

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,029
brilliant white spots appearing on the

103
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,000
surface of the Sun and this was so

104
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,310
unusual that he left his post trying to

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,830
find an assistant to drag over and show

106
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,840
hey hey hey come here there's two bright

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,060
white spots on the Sun well the Sun is

108
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,159
already white no no this is special come

109
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,169
over and by the time he dragged his

110
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:46,539
assistant over to look at the screen

111
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:49,210
they had faded but he recorded in his

112
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:52,539
journal what had occurred the the spots

113
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:57,430
here labeled a and B were within an

114
00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:00,818
existing sunspot area and were brilliant

115
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:04,810
white spots and these this this was the

116
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:08,589
very first observed solar flare but

117
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,610
associated with this solar flare was

118
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:15,580
something again that it's something that

119
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,029
has never been seen before this was what

120
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:24,580
we now know as a coronal mass ejection

121
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:30,849
the Sun got violently sick and as my

122
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:34,169
ship going to work it's not okay what

123
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:37,319
happened was eighteen hours after this

124
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,318
ejection of

125
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:45,920
ten million tons of ionized hydrogen gas

126
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:50,479
it struck the earth with the force of

127
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,600
ten thousand nuclear bombs this gas yet

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,230
the magnetosphere and shifted the make

129
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,150
the the Earth's magnetic field and it

130
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,270
was first observed by telegraph

131
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,070
operators in their offices they all of a

132
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,770
sudden started noticing that the

133
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,730
telegraph lines in their Telegraph Keys

134
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,590
were starting to throw arcs and sparks

135
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,300
growing in sides up to six inches

136
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,580
fearing something terrible was happening

137
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,830
they disconnected their batteries and

138
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,599
found out that they could still send

139
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,229
messages even with the battery's

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,120
disconnected what was happening was the

141
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,700
changes in the Earth's magnetic field

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,600
was inducing through an inductive field

143
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:35,990
currents in the telegraph lines violent

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,540
currents with with voltages capable of

145
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:44,510
jumping these six-inch sparks meanwhile

146
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:49,550
and there's no photographs to Damac this

147
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:51,349
up aurora borealis were being observed

148
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:56,710
at places they had never been seen

149
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,710
before as far south as Cuba and Panama

150
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,169
there were gold miners in the Sierra

151
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,820
Nevadas who woke in the middle of the

152
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,730
night thinking that it was dawn because

153
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,849
the sky was illuminated and chickens

154
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:15,220
started crowing and and all this but it

155
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:18,260
was a brilliant pink glow to the sky and

156
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,720
nobody knew what it was it wasn't until

157
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,930
they correlated this with the brilliant

158
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,120
Sun Sun solar flare that they kind of

159
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,620
figured that the Sun was involved with

160
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:35,419
this phenomenon this is a coronal mass

161
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,159
ejection there's another phenomenon that

162
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,630
that we want to talk about and that is

163
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:45,230
an EMP or electromagnetic pulse and the

164
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,350
first observation of this was with a

165
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,810
nuclear test called starfish prime this

166
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,640
occurred in July 9th

167
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:57,979
1962 the reasoning for this test was the

168
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,569
Van Allen belts had just been discovered

169
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,940
a couple years earlier

170
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,100
these are belts of intense radiation

171
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,720
that surround the earth and it was

172
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,970
thought at that time they would be in an

173
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,730
impenetrable barrier to space flight

174
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,320
they would destroy any satellite or

175
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,279
manned mission that would attempt to

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,339
pass through it

177
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,920
the starfish prime nuclear test was a

178
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,980
high-altitude hydrogen bomb explosion

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,089
that was sought to get information on

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,779
what would happen in a high-altitude

181
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:33,140
explosion and also possibly modify or

182
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:35,140
weaponize the Van Allen belts so this

183
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:40,339
took place over the Central Pacific

184
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,020
nearby the Hawaiian Islands and I have

185
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,990
another animated gifs that's not going

186
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,750
to work okay but this is the actual

187
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,779
photograph of that explosion at the

188
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:55,280
moment it took place over Honolulu you

189
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:57,710
see Honolulu down and below what

190
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,230
happened at that instant though was

191
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:03,080
something not entirely appreciated at

192
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,630
the time the explosion of the atom bomb

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,600
created a huge burst of gamma rays that

194
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,760
descended down into the atmosphere where

195
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,760
it knocked loose electrons and those

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,670
electrons created an intense burst of

197
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,720
radiofrequency energy that then passed

198
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,430
down into the the Hawaiian Islands and

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,100
basically anything within line of sight

200
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:30,349
of that bomb a lot of weird things

201
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,690
happened that we're not completely

202
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,180
understood at the time they had burglar

203
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,600
alarms going off strings of street

204
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,180
lights went out instantaneously there

205
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,390
was a microwave telephone link that

206
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,130
failed and it wasn't until some years

207
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:51,650
afterwards that the official explanation

208
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:54,800
came out a lot of the the actual test

209
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,260
information for this is still classified

210
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,900
interestingly enough so even to this day

211
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,370
we don't know exactly the the intensity

212
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:07,300
of the fields that were

213
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:11,029
measured at that point in October of

214
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,729
1962 the Russians had to have their own

215
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:16,700
high-altitude nuclear test they launched

216
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,870
a hydrogen bomb at a similar altitude

217
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,850
over Kazakh Stan and they observed some

218
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,040
different things now bear in mind that

219
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,940
Kazakh Stan was very sparsely populated

220
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,709
there were no transistor circuits

221
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,570
present there it was all vacuum tube

222
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:39,010
stuff but the Kazakhs observed that in

223
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:42,950
the aftermath of that atomic explosion

224
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,350
they had power transformers power

225
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,200
distribution transformers simply melting

226
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,580
down power lines were melting and

227
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:56,810
failing catching on fire and the main

228
00:11:51,580 --> 00:12:01,270
the main power supply to to the Kazakh

229
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,270
region caught on fire and burned down

230
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,189
this was something they did not expect

231
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:11,150
and it was very shocking now historians

232
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:14,930
what happened in October of 1962 Cuban

233
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:17,180
Missile Crisis immediately after this

234
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:21,260
test the Russians pulled their missiles

235
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:23,839
out of Cuba one can speculate whether

236
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,410
the outcome of this test had something

237
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,410
to do with that

238
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:39,640
now this is historically known we can we

239
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,620
we can extrapolate what can happen in

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,920
the future from what we know but it is

241
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,430
time for my disclaimer there's a lot

242
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,589
about these tests that we don't know

243
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:57,969
what we do know about the the historic

244
00:12:50,589 --> 00:13:00,910
EMP tests is they occurred and we can

245
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,970
try to simulate those tests using EMP

246
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,969
simulators to recreate the this

247
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,740
particular impulses that were measured

248
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,079
with equipment that may not have been

249
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:17,290
capable of fully capturing the effect

250
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:20,829
what happened in 1962 mostly occurred to

251
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,480
vacuum tube electronics the transistor

252
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:27,640
electronics said the day we're very

253
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:32,790
simple not a lot of it there much of the

254
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:37,209
details are still classified much of the

255
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,160
projected damage that is officially

256
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,130
within the US government project

257
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,980
projections is not correlated by what

258
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:50,350
happened over Kazakh Stan they saw much

259
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:53,100
worse results most likely because the

260
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,269
Hawaiian island is very different

261
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:00,430
geographically than the plains of Kazakh

262
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:03,670
Stan so my disclaimer is there's just a

263
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:07,359
lot about EMPs in particular that we do

264
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,160
not know I'm going to provide the best

265
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,740
information that I've been able to glean

266
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,660
from open source data and if you choose

267
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,970
to disagree with me I'm not going to

268
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,779
argue there's there's room for

269
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,029
disagreement but again I'm going to try

270
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,720
to present the best information that I

271
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:32,019
can we can extrapolate from this

272
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,750
information try to project and predict

273
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:37,690
what may happen should another EMP burst

274
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,329
occur this over the continental United

275
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,589
States but in the end there's a lot we

276
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,589
don't know and cannot know

277
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:50,970
what we do know of EMP occurring from a

278
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,610
high-altitude nuclear burst is there are

279
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,190
three spectral components the first is

280
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,800
called II one that's the first component

281
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,889
of the burst and that's due to the high

282
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,339
powered gamma rays penetrating the

283
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:13,680
atmosphere knockin loose electrons that

284
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:16,410
is a 50,000 volt per meter pulse okay

285
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,779
point of reference inside your microwave

286
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,189
oven the magnet the electrical fields

287
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:25,439
are only a thousand volts per meter and

288
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,820
in a confined space 50,000 volts per

289
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,760
meter across thousands of miles it is

290
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:37,670
however a very brief pulse only about

291
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:41,370
five nanoseconds wide so this means that

292
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:45,540
it has a peak of its frequency component

293
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:48,990
somewhere around the 500 megahertz range

294
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:52,649
perhaps so that means that the resonant

295
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:57,930
antenna is going to be something foot or

296
00:15:52,649 --> 00:16:01,709
so in length following a 1 is called the

297
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,399
e2 burst that is approximately 1

298
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:08,310
microsecond in length about a hundred

299
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,649
times weaker in intensity and very much

300
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,050
mimics the effect of a nearby lightning

301
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,880
strike now who here has had lightning

302
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,589
strike a tree near your house

303
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,040
and you've lost your washing machine

304
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,069
your TV your computer yeah this is going

305
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,969
to be the same thing that happens over a

306
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:32,069
multi hundred mile area following that

307
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:34,199
is what's called the e3 effect and that

308
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:37,079
is a massive disruption of the Earth's

309
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,959
magnetic field and that occurs do they

310
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,810
due to the huge mass of ionized gases

311
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,300
that are rising convectively after the

312
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,609
nuclear blast and those charged

313
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,469
particles in their motion create a

314
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,209
magnetic field that disrupts the Earth's

315
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:56,089
field that induces currents into long

316
00:16:54,209 --> 00:17:01,969
suspended wires in

317
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:05,179
Euler power lines this period occurs in

318
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:10,010
a period of tens to hundreds of seconds

319
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:12,400
and then it's over and this diagram

320
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,890
shows the the particular voltage

321
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:20,870
intensity and time profile of what's

322
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:23,089
likely to happen now the damaging

323
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,579
effects again are going to be related to

324
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,490
the intensity and the wavelengths of

325
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:32,510
these these effects II one is going to

326
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:35,210
affect short antennas which are likely

327
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,809
to be the power cords that plug into

328
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:42,049
your appliances internal wiring perhaps

329
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:45,860
that may be of the appropriate length to

330
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:47,870
pick up these signals e two again as I

331
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,309
mentioned is is similar to the effect of

332
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:55,639
a nearby lightning strike III this is

333
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:59,440
interesting it's it its effect is to

334
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,649
create DC currents within power lines

335
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,210
which were designed to carry AC when

336
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:09,408
those currents enter transformers it

337
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,980
gives the opportunity for the

338
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:16,429
transformer to saturate its open circuit

339
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:22,460
inductance goes to zero it overloads and

340
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:25,490
can be destructive there's a specific

341
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,000
distribution of the effects that we can

342
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:34,190
project from a high altitude nuke if you

343
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,419
have something that is set off at say a

344
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,799
300 mile altitude over the Upper Midwest

345
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,230
the distribution of the effect is

346
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:45,918
actually in an arc primarily to the

347
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,110
southern distribution with peaks of 50

348
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,140
thousand volts per meter again in the

349
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,510
red zone but even throughout the light

350
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,370
blue circle you're going to see voltages

351
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,770
of twenty five thousand volts per meter

352
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,610
so it could literally blanket the entire

353
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,610
United States

354
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:10,620
knowing what these pulses look like in

355
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,350
terms of amplitude and frequency we can

356
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,110
build simulators that strive to

357
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,969
duplicate these effects and here we have

358
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,909
the North American Electric Reliability

359
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,790
corporation has built their simulator

360
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,280
and and and what this is you can see a

361
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,860
bar across the top that's a dipole

362
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,670
antenna it's excited from a Marx

363
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:36,000
generator that is capable of delivering

364
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:39,690
a 500,000 volt pulse into this roughly

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,390
10 meter long antenna and items to be

366
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:50,040
tested will be placed underneath that so

367
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:53,309
the question is should an EMP occur what

368
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:57,620
is likely to survive and the easy answer

369
00:19:53,309 --> 00:20:00,960
is things without a lot of transistors a

370
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:03,989
battery a battery is big and dumb and

371
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,340
chemical your car battery will survive

372
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,040
the little batteries in your smoke

373
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,409
detector and transistor radio will

374
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,050
survive but the smart batteries in your

375
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:16,320
computers and cell phones are not likely

376
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:19,760
to survive because they include smart

377
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,760
charging circuitry inside

378
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,360
what will survive an e-1 pulse a tube

379
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,059
type radio this is the classic how the

380
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,840
crafters s38 Thomas do you have one

381
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:38,910
yeah very good

382
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:41,540
okay tube type equipment did not

383
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,120
experience failures in the Hawaiin test

384
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,790
because the vacuum tubes are macro

385
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,678
electronics not micro electronics they

386
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:55,230
are large scale devices that can absorb

387
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:58,740
the energy okay this is a very popular

388
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,929
radio among Preppers because it is a

389
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,679
transformer list design it can be

390
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,510
operated from a hundred twenty volts DC

391
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,380
tin car batteries strung together will

392
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,530
run this so if you want to make some

393
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,420
money find one of these at a flea market

394
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,920
upgrade it and change the capacitors put

395
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:23,040
it on eBay as a

396
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:29,280
radio you can make some money okay

397
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:32,340
in 9th 2004 the EMP Commission studied

398
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,910
37 different cars placed them in that

399
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,909
simulator hit them with the EMP pulse

400
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:43,890
the e1 pulse and found to their

401
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,480
amazement all of them survived ok I read

402
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,130
this and I had such a cognitive

403
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,900
dissonance I could not understand that

404
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,880
because everything that I've read up to

405
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,260
that point says oh it's total disaster

406
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,640
nothing will survive we're going to be

407
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,980
going back to horse and buggy but ok

408
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,150
I've worked in the automotive

409
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,010
engineering world for quite a few years

410
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:08,160
automobiles are designed to withstand

411
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:11,250
some absolutely horrific electrical

412
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,290
conditions a automobile and it's

413
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,170
electrical components must be designed

414
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,680
to survive installing the battery

415
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,680
backwards

416
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,840
because because the nuclear scientists

417
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,520
are doing nuclear science and the other

418
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,520
guys are working in auto mechanics

419
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:37,170
inside every electrical component inside

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,690
the car is a certain suppressor it's a

421
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:45,420
powerful Zener diode it's about the size

422
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:48,680
of a nickel and the electrical spec for

423
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,420
cars says that it must survive the

424
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,800
application of a pulse of a hundred

425
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,460
twenty volts for four hundred

426
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,010
microseconds four hundred milliseconds

427
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,360
excuse me so those Zener diodes which

428
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,590
are distributed out through the entire

429
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,870
car have to sync that energy and it will

430
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,179
do a wonderful job for a neat to pulse

431
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:15,510
and evidently it does a pretty good job

432
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:18,300
for an e-1 pulse also so at first glance

433
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,340
you would say that the the advice of all

434
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,700
the preparedness experts that you get to

435
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,919
a pre 1980s diesel vehicle that has no

436
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,620
electronics in it well yeah that's a

437
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,700
good advice but even afterwards it may

438
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,850
not be such a bad deal okay my caveat my

439
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:39,510
disclaimer I have to throw in here after

440
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:42,770
2004 cars have been manufactured with a

441
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:45,510
whole lot more computer circuitry is

442
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:48,060
that computer circuitry going to be more

443
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:52,170
vulnerable than what was made in 2004

444
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:54,960
odds are yes but I can't tell you how

445
00:23:52,170 --> 00:24:00,690
much more because we've not had a test

446
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,370
done since then as it turns out most ham

447
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:08,070
equipment will survive there were a

448
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:10,050
series of tests done in 1985 results

449
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,480
were published in qst magazine if you

450
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:16,860
want to look that up again by the the

451
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,140
EMP Commission and you would think that

452
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,270
this this equipment has a lot of

453
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,060
transistors in it it's going to fail due

454
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:27,990
to that pulse and it turns out that none

455
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,870
of it did again the cognitive distance

456
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,240
hits because we're told everything's

457
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,239
going to die

458
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,710
this stuff did not and the reason for

459
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,080
that is this transceiver equipment here

460
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,990
must generate about a hundred watts so

461
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,409
it must not interfere with itself so

462
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,660
there is protection circuit built in to

463
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,660
keep it from destroying itself from its

464
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,179
own internally generated electromagnetic

465
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,390
fields and that also gives a degree of

466
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:02,059
protection from external fields and

467
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,570
these radios even with the antennas of

468
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:10,250
their microphones plugged in seem to

469
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:15,050
survive now my disclaimer those radios

470
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:18,740
had metal cabinets these little walkie

471
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,899
talkies have plastic cases the metal

472
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,710
provides some protection that the

473
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:29,240
plastic does not my beloved little

474
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:33,350
walkie-talkie might not survive but I

475
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:38,270
have plans for it what will survive in a

476
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:40,850
one pulse strategic weapons and they

477
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:44,120
must as we'll get into in a little bit

478
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:47,000
I've actually seen these planes up close

479
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,909
and the groovy thing is the windshield

480
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,890
and the windows on it have a metal grid

481
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,980
embedded in them just like the windows

482
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:59,000
of a microwave oven it keeps the stuff

483
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:03,860
out because you want this flying when

484
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,270
the bombs start going off but what is

485
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:11,209
vulnerable from the EMP testing we know

486
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,879
that things with a lot of micro

487
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,340
electronics have very small gates which

488
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:22,040
are not capable of absorbing large

489
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:25,250
amounts of energy so for that we know

490
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,428
that likely your your satellite

491
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,460
receivers smart meters anything with a

492
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:34,280
lot of micro electronics in it that is

493
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,559
not specifically hardened for any type

494
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:41,149
of industrial control it's likely to go

495
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:44,540
sorry so ways to protect your vulnerable

496
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,870
electronics number one disconnect

497
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,029
everything that's not a new

498
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,459
and that's good advice whether you're

499
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:52,529
fearing that the North Koreans are going

500
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,570
to launch nuke or if you're in lightning

501
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,390
season and you're sitting on top of a

502
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,250
mountain unplug everything because the

503
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,020
wiring of your house is a great antenna

504
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,000
that's going to collect that energy and

505
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,710
direct it into anything that's plugged

506
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,260
in my personal favorite strategy is to

507
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:13,890
put a surge suppressor on everything

508
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:16,679
that is plugged in that's electronics so

509
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,929
your computer your microwave your TV all

510
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,700
that expensive stuff go down to Walmart

511
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,159
get a search press or it plugs in your

512
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,679
outlet and that will swallow

513
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,279
most of the energy of a pulse that comes

514
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:33,059
in your line when when lightning struck

515
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,100
near my house in 2008 we lost two CFL

516
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,918
lightbulbs and all the neighbors around

517
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,490
us lost microwaves and ovens and washing

518
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,980
machines and expensive stuff number

519
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,649
three shield everything with a Faraday

520
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,380
cage anything that is particularly

521
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:51,570
sensitive that you care about or that

522
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:56,610
cannot be protected in any any of the

523
00:27:51,570 --> 00:28:03,510
other ways okay a Faraday cage is not a

524
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:05,879
cage for ferrets and there's a lot a lot

525
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,520
of misconceptions and myths that go

526
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,890
around about what makes an effective

527
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,370
Faraday cage a Faraday cage simply

528
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:17,789
stated is a conductive sphere or body

529
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:20,309
that surrounds your sensitive item it's

530
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:23,480
made of highly conductive material with

531
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:28,230
some thickness to it so it will conduct

532
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,000
that pulse around your sensitive item so

533
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,960
that this the item and the center does

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,809
not even know that a pulse has occurred

535
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,149
if you go into the prepper literature

536
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:41,158
they will tell you a lot of things yeah

537
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:43,289
they'll tell you put your electronics in

538
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,480
an ammo box and ammo boxes made of steel

539
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:48,390
oh yeah it's good except it's not

540
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:53,279
because steel is a very poor conductor

541
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:55,770
of electricity you're you get just about

542
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,130
as much good by digging a hole and

543
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,990
burying your item

544
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,320
not that I would recommend that either

545
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,780
additionally the steel box has a lid

546
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,689
that just folds down on top and does not

547
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,270
create a metal to metal contact so that

548
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:15,490
gap is wide open for these frequencies

549
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:17,470
to penetrate other okay okay I'm getting

550
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,240
a headache here one of the other prepper

551
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,370
sites says well if you see the blast

552
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,560
just throw your radio into the microwave

553
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:30,899
and slam the door if you can do that

554
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:33,970
within 5 nano seconds you're pretty good

555
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,070
yeah a microwave oven is intended to

556
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,530
shield the microwaves insight from

557
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,740
getting out and vice versa it's better

558
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:44,350
than nothing but you can do better and

559
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,770
and the other one which really gets me

560
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,780
is the so-called EMP bags and they're

561
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,389
sold on the same websites that sell the

562
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:58,120
nutritional supplements that we were

563
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,800
talking about earlier yeah if you buy

564
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,199
parts from digi-key they come in these

565
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,649
bags it's kind of a silvery colored

566
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:09,250
plastic and you can see through them and

567
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,410
in my reasoning if you can see through

568
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,280
them that the metallization is not

569
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,960
really too adequate and there's there's

570
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,510
empirical tests where yeah you put your

571
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,830
mic your cell phone in here and dial it

572
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,470
and it may not pick up but there's also

573
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:31,179
some some actual tests which we'll get

574
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:34,090
into in a second science experiment here

575
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,640
okay we talked about decibels or DB

576
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,250
that's a measure of attenuation 10 DB

577
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,780
means that you're cutting things by a

578
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:47,890
factor of 10 taking out 90% of the

579
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:50,770
signal 20 DB is a hundredfold 30 DB is

580
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,770
1,000 fold so when we're talking about

581
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:58,660
how much shielding you get we're going

582
00:30:53,770 --> 00:31:01,930
to talk about DB your file cabinet and

583
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,530
ammo box gives you less than 10 DB of

584
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:08,260
attenuation now these are verified by

585
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,779
some experiments by a NASA scientist dr.

586
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,059
Arthur Bradley who

587
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:14,489
has actually gone with calibrated

588
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,408
equipment not a cell phone experiment

589
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:19,609
calibrated equipment to measure the

590
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:25,109
attenuation at the frequencies of choice

591
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:30,149
the EMP bag is only good for about 15 DB

592
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:35,699
a galvanized trashcan gives you 20 DB so

593
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:37,559
that's taking out 99% of the impulse but

594
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,309
I just said that steel is not a good

595
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,710
material for a Faraday shield it's not

596
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:45,658
the steel of the trashcan that's working

597
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,570
here it's the zinc coating that's

598
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,499
actually a pretty decent conductor if

599
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:54,450
you wrap the lid with aluminum duct tape

600
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:56,279
the the metal tape that you can get at

601
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,080
the hardware store you double the

602
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,080
effectiveness which tells you that the

603
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,149
gap around the lid leaks a whole lot of

604
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:08,968
energy in that you can very effectively

605
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:12,928
knock down a microwave oven is good for

606
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:16,649
25 to 40 DB but the simplest and easiest

607
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:21,479
one you get a sheet of aluminum foil you

608
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:24,330
take it out of your hat take your

609
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:26,070
sensitive item fold it over wrap it up

610
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,080
like you're making a sandwich that you

611
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,029
want to keep really fresh crimp over

612
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,609
those edges just as tight as you can and

613
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:36,450
that right there is good for 50 DB of

614
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:38,899
attenuation how much do you need and

615
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:43,019
that's something that nobody ever says

616
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:44,459
okay I'm gonna stick my neck out here

617
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,710
and I will be the first person to ever

618
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,589
say so but I'm going to define that you

619
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:54,479
need 60 decibels of attenuation of that

620
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:58,200
50 kilo volt signal to be safe in just

621
00:32:54,479 --> 00:33:00,869
about every condition you can't so you

622
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,849
take your folded aluminum foil wrap you

623
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:04,678
stick it in another plastic bag and wrap

624
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,928
it around with aluminum foil again

625
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,450
you've now got a hundred DB of

626
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:14,039
attenuation and nothing's getting

627
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:16,739
through that personally what do I keep

628
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,070
in a Faraday cage it's things that are

629
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:23,610
absolutely essential and not easily

630
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,530
obtainable I have another walkie talkie

631
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:30,600
just like that wrapped in aluminum foil

632
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:33,600
I have a 40 meter CW ham radio

633
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,120
transceiver if the communication

634
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,699
infrastructure goes down this will still

635
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,250
allow me to send long-haul signals over

636
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,070
thousands of miles to handle emergency

637
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,020
messages things like this were used in

638
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,159
the aftermath of Katrina for months

639
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:52,580
until they got the telephone

640
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:55,140
infrastructure back up a multiband radio

641
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,049
years you're going to need information

642
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,140
there will be broadcasters that survive

643
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:02,400
an incident like this where they get

644
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,200
their information from is another

645
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,070
question but you will need that

646
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,080
information and whether it's am/fm or

647
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,730
any of the shortwave bands there will be

648
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:18,840
something there that you can listen to

649
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:23,219
and something of use okay this one and

650
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:25,139
there are chuckles and and and the the

651
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,790
presentation last night about putting

652
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:35,429
Linux on one of these ear eaters was

653
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:38,429
really good you know ideally I would

654
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,100
love to have a tablet that is milled

655
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:44,820
spec and recognized but the old burns

656
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,560
Noble Nook it's in a rubberized case I

657
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,280
can drop it and it's gonna survive and

658
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,649
the cool thing is it will have multiple

659
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,070
months of battery life because there's

660
00:34:52,649 --> 00:35:01,500
no backlight to suck the battery I've

661
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:06,020
got a 16 gig card in here with six

662
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:09,119
thousand books and documents in here

663
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,160
manuals for every vehicle I own every

664
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,250
appliance I own every piece of ham radio

665
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,540
equipment that I own books on medicine

666
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:20,670
surgery metallurgy welding woodworking

667
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:24,350
it's all on archive.org just go out

668
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:27,090
there spend a couple of days downloading

669
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,700
downloading the information that will be

670
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:32,250
essential in the event that the internet

671
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,839
does not exist tomorrow or you can't

672
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,750
make a trip down to the library because

673
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:42,900
people are burning books for heat

674
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:44,550
a multimeter because I'm gonna be fixing

675
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,870
all the stuff to get that that I

676
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:51,660
couldn't fit in the Faraday cage okay I

677
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,220
do not have one of these but the

678
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,250
vulnerable part of your car will be the

679
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,290
engine computer it's already pretty well

680
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,940
shielded but again it's the vulnerable

681
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,360
part and it makes the difference between

682
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,540
your car being a usable vehicle for

683
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,880
getting around or a $10,000 garden

684
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,650
ornament get one of these wrap it in

685
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,300
foil and you're good go to the junkyard

686
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:21,870
they're cheap now then for an e3 pulse

687
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:31,760
the e3 pulse would be the consequence of

688
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:34,710
either CME or or the the e3 from a EMP

689
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,470
that induces the very high voltages and

690
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:44,000
the DC currents which will burn out the

691
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:47,549
Transformers in 2003 there was a small

692
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,550
CME that mostly affected the upper

693
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:53,070
altitudes of Canada this is actual

694
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,630
pictures of one of the high-powered

695
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:58,860
distribution transformers that was

696
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,470
burned out from the onset of the CME and

697
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,290
the disruption in the magnetosphere to

698
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:07,589
the the damage and failure of this

699
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,690
transformer it was 90 seconds there's

700
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:13,160
not a lot of time to react to that if

701
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,160
you're even aware that it's happening

702
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:22,950
this has been analyzed and the effects

703
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:26,180
projected for a CME of half a micro

704
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:31,020
Tesla per minute of magnetic flux change

705
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:35,310
which is corresponding to the the the

706
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,230
damage that occurred in the 1921 cime

707
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:40,700
which was only about half the strength

708
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:47,190
of what happened in the Carrington event

709
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:50,529
okay these green dots are where

710
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,240
geomagnetic current exits the ground red

711
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,760
is where it enters back into the ground

712
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,790
so anytime you see one of these circles

713
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:04,630
you will have a circuit breaker blowing

714
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:07,000
these two elements here in circles left

715
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,920
and right side that represents areas

716
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,859
where transformers will fail and there

717
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:18,190
will be long-term power outages if there

718
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:21,089
is a cm of an EMP blast over Chicago

719
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,349
based on these projected field strengths

720
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:31,029
this is the damage and you have

721
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:32,770
nationwide grid down in such a case you

722
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:35,740
are going to see something on the order

723
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:38,890
of 350 high voltage transformers

724
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,020
destroyed wanted true trillion dollars

725
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,690
of economic damage the first year and up

726
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,660
to 10 years to restore the problem is

727
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:50,619
these transformers take about a year to

728
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:52,990
build there are very few places in the

729
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:55,240
United States that that make them most

730
00:38:52,990 --> 00:39:00,910
of them are made in in Europe and

731
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:03,368
shipped over so that's an issue you

732
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:06,879
cannot replace 350 of them all at one

733
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:09,940
time as it exists the grid is operating

734
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,849
at about 90% capacity it's more

735
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,069
efficient that way if you lose 10% of

736
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:18,510
your transformer capacity everything

737
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:22,808
goes down beyond that you're talking

738
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:27,940
world global or national blackout

739
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:31,510
conditions the fragility of the grid is

740
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:36,190
one thing but it's interdependence II on

741
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:38,020
all of the other essential services you

742
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,549
have to stop and pause and reflect on

743
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,130
that because you you are you have

744
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:45,339
effects on the oil and gas industry all

745
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:48,000
these pipelines are pumped without power

746
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:50,200
to pump them you lose gas and oil

747
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,960
Communications internet cell phones

748
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,640
landlines all of those operate on the

749
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,400
grid they have battery backups which

750
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,049
lasts for perhaps 36 hours if you're

751
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,530
lucky the really good ones have

752
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,300
sets and diesel storage that can run for

753
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:10,040
a couple of weeks past that point they

754
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:11,750
go down water is being pumped without

755
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,300
the pumping stations that run on the

756
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,250
grid that goes down you have no water to

757
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,970
drink you have no water to flush the

758
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:23,780
toilet banking in finance your credit

759
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:27,410
card goes non-functional I don't have

760
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:33,320
any cash in my pocket doggone it that's

761
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:35,450
a problem transportation if if for

762
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,540
example we have multiple vehicle

763
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:42,470
failures say in in the tunnels here we

764
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:45,560
are now locked in it cannot escape the

765
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:48,410
island emergency services are similarly

766
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,600
affected they are vitally dependent upon

767
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:53,180
communication and the government

768
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,549
services FEMA and so on which would be

769
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,339
providing emergency services cannot

770
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:03,170
communicate cannot cannot be transported

771
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,480
basically any grocery store has about

772
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:11,480
three days worth of inventory and when

773
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:17,270
that's gone stomach start rumbling worst

774
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:19,400
case scenario is if you have an e3 event

775
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,550
that sends a search backup into a

776
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,710
nuclear power plant you can shut down a

777
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,110
nuclear power plant in its core remains

778
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,120
hot for several weeks and unless there

779
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,610
are water pumps that continuously cool

780
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,299
that it melts down that's the that's

781
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:38,450
what happened in Fukushima there are

782
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:41,200
generators on-site with diesel fuel to

783
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,250
operate these pumps every installation

784
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,939
enough fuel to keep it running

785
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:49,790
if those gents if those gensets and

786
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:53,390
pumps are affected by either an e1 or an

787
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:57,460
e3 pulse bad things happen and you've

788
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,460
got nuclear power plants all over

789
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:07,479
use of EMP in warfare yeah we know who

790
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,970
the bad guys are most likely it's the

791
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,800
the little loud mouths like North Korea

792
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:18,490
and Iran trouble is though it's very

793
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,589
hard to do an EMP anonymously you can

794
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,259
follow the missiles with the radar back

795
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:25,089
to the point of origin the concept of

796
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,200
mutually assured destruction has been

797
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:28,710
very effective

798
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:34,980
even though kind of scary for the past

799
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:37,900
several generations but you know what

800
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:42,280
it's difficult to predict the psychology

801
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:44,079
of other entities you can you can you

802
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,750
can project something like a school

803
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,570
shooter who acts in a very irrational

804
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,520
manner to take out as many other people

805
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:55,750
as he wants knowing that his ultimate

806
00:42:51,520 --> 00:43:02,710
goal is suicide project from there to a

807
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:05,200
much larger gun but the saving grace in

808
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:07,839
my mind is that nuclear weapons are

809
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,419
extremely expensive and so are the

810
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,819
delivery systems and those people most

811
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,210
likely to use it are the ones least

812
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:17,589
likely to afford it but with the

813
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,550
knowledge of the vulnerability of the

814
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:23,369
grid comes another threat it takes a guy

815
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:27,369
with a high-powered rifle on a hillside

816
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:30,069
three or four shots to put a hole in one

817
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:33,220
of these high voltage transformers the

818
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:35,349
oil drains out it overloads it overheats

819
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,839
and it's gone this happened in

820
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:45,790
California in 2014 and nobody was ever

821
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:50,529
caught and it has all the hallmarks of a

822
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:53,920
deliberate act as a rehearsal okay 9/11

823
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:58,150
was nineteen guys with flight lessons in

824
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,130
airplanes you find a hundred unhappy

825
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,260
people with high-powered rifles and they

826
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:05,770
could do as much damage as a

827
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,310
high-altitude EMP for one one thousandth

828
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,310
of the budget

829
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:20,710
okay okay

830
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:24,200
what is being done to protect us the the

831
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,180
2015 transportation bill had seventeen

832
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,649
million dollars set aside for an EMP

833
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:33,379
study to identify transformers in

834
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:39,579
inventory that can be moved and to set

835
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:42,140
aside a strategic transformer pool of

836
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:44,720
Transformers that can be bought put in

837
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,609
place ready to be shipped around the

838
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,160
country at a moment's notice

839
00:44:46,609 --> 00:45:01,598
so it's not totally hopeless for us to

840
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:04,549
survive make some plans can you for this

841
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,480
my everyday carry is my MacGyver

842
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:10,430
pocketknife it's super handy because the

843
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,730
good beer does not come in twist-off

844
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,730
tops

845
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,610
you need to be able to at the very least

846
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:21,550
provide for warmth use one of these

847
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:23,830
mylar space blankets be able to open a

848
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,720
can be able to purify water get

849
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,850
information in communication like my

850
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:33,580
little nook my little walkie-talkie that

851
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:36,130
is essential essential reading one

852
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,750
second after by William fortune is a

853
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,210
piece of fiction but it's very accurate

854
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:43,750
and well researched a couple of other

855
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:47,050
authors Fernando Aguirre SELCO Begich

856
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:50,950
these two gentlemen were in Argentina

857
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:53,200
and Yugoslavia respectively during the

858
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,899
unpleasantness there and they have seen

859
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,270
the effects of disruption of systems and

860
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,680
the effect on people who suddenly find

861
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:06,130
themselves going into third world

862
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:10,299
existence and hunger one of my key

863
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:12,100
formative experiences was in 2003 when

864
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,400
Hurricane Isabel hit Williamsburg

865
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:18,250
Virginia when I was living there it was

866
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,010
a cat5 storm on it hit the Outer Banks

867
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:24,040
and by the time it rolled through there

868
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,680
were millions of trees down we had just

869
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,650
moved into this cul-de-sac and when the

870
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,830
storm blew over and the Sun came out we

871
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,390
all stepped out to survey the damage

872
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:38,770
there was no phone there was no power

873
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:40,540
and there would not be for weeks and we

874
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,170
looked up and down the street and there

875
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:46,509
were people that we had never met before

876
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,880
that's the reality of suburban suburban

877
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:52,600
life but we were now meeting these

878
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,120
neighbors and realizing we've got

879
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,180
refrigerators full of food that's gonna

880
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,640
go bad so we rolled the gas grills out

881
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,490
of our garages and fired them up and

882
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,600
started cooking first the frozen pizzas

883
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,060
as they thawed

884
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,250
then the hamburgers then the roasts then

885
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,799
the hams and then the turkeys and we had

886
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:15,220
a week-long block party

887
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,440
and in the process we made friends

888
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:21,730
lifelong friends that we never would

889
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,520
have otherwise and and I think that is

890
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:27,010
kind of a microcosm lesson of how we

891
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,870
need to be facing this because it didn't

892
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,180
matter if the guy down the street had a

893
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,940
rainbow flag and the other guy had a

894
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:46,480
confederate flag all those flags blew

895
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:50,890
away in the wind and and even though

896
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,900
worst case projections will be that bad

897
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,400
things can happen and millions of people

898
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,440
will die millions of people will not be

899
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,870
one of the ones who will not and you

900
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,300
will have an opportunity to rebuild your

901
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,450
community and make it a better place

902
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,450
thank you

903
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,600
you
