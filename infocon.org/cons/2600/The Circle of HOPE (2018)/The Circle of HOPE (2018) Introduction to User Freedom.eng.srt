3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:21,539
No whoa hi yay okay holding a microphone

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,279
hi this is introduction to user freedom

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,359
I'm Molly de Blanc and this is Karen

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,159
Sandler a quick introduction about us my

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,749
name is Karen Sandler I'm the executive

8
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:33,150
director of an organization called the

9
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:35,129
software freedom Conservancy we are a

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,989
non-profit charity and the home of

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,060
almost 50 free and open-source software

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,730
projects stop I see some people

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,920
applauding stuff you're using like for

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,449
example git but tons of other projects

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,810
too we're also the home of outreach e

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,530
which is a diversity initiative and we

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,300
are also the ones who enforce the GPL on

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,730
behalf of Linux kernel developers who

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,379
asked us to and a few of our member

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,959
projects and I'm interested in all of

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,540
this in large part because I literally

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,129
have a big heart my heart is three times

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,499
the size of a normal person's heart it's

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,850
called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and

25
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm at a very high risk of suddenly

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,850
dying so I have a pacemaker

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,158
defibrillator implanted in my body and

28
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,899
studying my own defibrillator and how

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,899
defibrillators work made me passionate

30
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:23,520
about the safety of our software

31
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,159
generally and it turned me into someone

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,740
who thought that open-source was cool

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,789
and useful into someone who thinks that

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,859
software freedom is essential I'm Molly

35
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,659
de Blanc that's my twitter handle that

36
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,658
is my personal Twitter not my work

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,689
Twitter actually the bottom one is also

38
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,060
not my not my work Twitter it's in fact

39
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,419
my personal status net account so you

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,369
can reach me in either of those places

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,799
I'm the campaign's manager at the free

42
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,229
software foundation so I do organizing

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,209
and education around free software and

44
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,619
free software related issues I also

45
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,429
serve on the board of directors of the

46
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:08,459
open source initiative so what is user

47
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:13,710
freedom user freedom thank you

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,990
user freedom is the idea that we

49
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,880
have the right and the ability well we

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,310
should have the right and ability to

51
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,420
choose and understand our technology

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,750
that when we're using it we're

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,609
consenting to it enthusiastically and as

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,580
part of that we need to have autonomy

55
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,460
over over our computing and as part of

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,480
that we need to have the knowledge to

57
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,400
understand and make conscientious

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,260
decisions and then the ability to make

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,120
those changes and have control over our

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,079
software and all of our technology that

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,850
we use our rights extend to digital

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,830
spaces the idea of digital rights

63
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,710
especially in this context is that in

64
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,240
the regular world we have all these

65
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,730
rights and freedoms that we've agreed

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,110
upon and that just because we're looking

67
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,910
at a different framework and working in

68
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,240
a different paradigm doesn't mean that

69
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,260
it's actually that different the

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,580
frameworks that we've already

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,769
established for the way that we

72
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,730
communicate and the way that we interact

73
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,100
with society aren't are well established

74
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,840
and we we shouldn't think of them as

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,519
completely new ideas just because we

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,490
have new ways of doing it we should

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,120
apply our rationale for these strong

78
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,860
ideas around privacy and and all of the

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,300
other rights and freedoms that we expect

80
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,150
in that same overall context I know this

81
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,510
is a very savvy audience I think

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,550
compared to many others but there's a

83
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,829
knee-jerk reaction to say we do

84
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,080
everything so differently now you know

85
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,270
people say we didn't used to have email

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,740
we didn't used to have you know these

87
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,720
platforms that we communicate with each

88
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,360
other so we have to think of completely

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,640
new ways of thinking about important

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,430
issues about our technology and about

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,890
our society but what I found to be most

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,600
useful is to go back to well how how did

93
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,730
we used to think about doing the same

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,500
thing and applying that to a new

95
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,810
framework and trying to find a rational

96
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:10,860
way to map that out so what is software

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,740
freedom there's a nervous silence in the

98
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,820
crowd like you might not know the answer

99
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,799
if you don't know the answer that's

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,409
totally okay because we're gonna explain

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,719
it to you yes and I would say that a lot

102
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,850
of people get involved with in the field

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,460
and are active in free and open source

104
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,480
software and many of them haven't taken

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,270
the time to step back and

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,460
about what what that means and and how

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,640
that plays out so I really love this

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,620
this image which is I think from a FSF

109
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,620
t-shirt yes you can in fact get it

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,400
upstairs in the expo hall or whatever

111
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,010
that's called

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,710
that's a shameless plug I love it

113
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,349
because I think it it it it shows us

114
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,979
very explicitly what these four freedoms

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,630
mean so so we generally think of four

116
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,540
freedoms with respect to our software or

117
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,500
the ability to run the software to use

118
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,890
it the ability to to edit it and make

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,800
changes the ability to contribute and

120
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,500
then and then the ability to not just

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,690
share the original copy or the original

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,490
version that you're using but also the

123
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,140
ability to share the changes the

124
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,760
modifications that you have made to the

125
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:32,610
software so free software is necessary

126
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:34,849
for user freedom yes great thanks free

127
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,070
software is necessary for user freedom

128
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:43,350
software freedom is this tool that we've

129
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,550
created to help protect user freedom one

130
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,280
of the things that free software does

131
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,660
and means is that we can look at these

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,510
things we can take them apart we can

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,400
understand them and we can't consent and

134
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,409
we can't consent enthusiastically to

135
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,270
using software and using technology if

136
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,520
we don't understand and if we can't

137
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,380
understand what's going on for it so one

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,669
of the ways somebody recently gave me

139
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,210
really good language for this which is

140
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:09,410
that software freedom enables user

141
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,539
freedom yeah I like to think of it as

142
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,280
software freedom being at the service of

143
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,650
all of the other freedoms that we need

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,099
software freedom is an essential tool

145
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,659
that we need to accomplish our our

146
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,240
protection and make sure that our

147
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,390
technology is ethical it's like a

148
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,270
cornerstone piece of ethical technology

149
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,909
so another way to think about this is by

150
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,729
using the example of a Terms of Service

151
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,410
right so a Terms of Service usually when

152
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,840
we see them and we see them every day or

153
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,830
many of us some of us people see them

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,419
every day

155
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,680
and agree to them usually without

156
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,560
reading them because they're these

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,949
complicated crunchy things that make no

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,539
sense

159
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,490
so Terms of Service really needs to be

160
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,320
clear and concise for us to be able to

161
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,780
click I agree and do so in good

162
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,610
conscience however that is not what

163
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,830
happens and the same thing is true with

164
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,350
technology it needs to be something that

165
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,150
can be interpreted and understood in a

166
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,520
clear and concise manner in order for

167
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,099
people to be able to click I agree in

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,650
good conscience this particular image is

169
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,800
an art piece trade from Dar vanevski

170
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,388
called

171
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,979
I agree which printed out several

172
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,599
different Terms of Service from websites

173
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,080
and I should introduce you

174
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,669
I'm I'm also a lawyer in addition to

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,609
being executive director of an

176
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,229
organization and this is not legal

177
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,270
advice why you would think it was legal

178
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,539
advice I don't know but it's not legal

179
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,669
advice and I am NOT your lawyer but but

180
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,669
to do a slight legal rant which is that

181
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,190
I I cannot believe that these Terms of

182
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,549
Service are in fact enforceable and I've

183
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,530
been really floored by the evolution of

184
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,240
our case law and contract to uphold them

185
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,419
because if you look at these Terms of

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,090
Service they're just outrageously long

187
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,760
professor published a paper that showed

188
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,159
that you would have to read for months

189
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,740
in order to like consistently every day

190
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,419
reading these Terms of Service to just

191
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,610
agree to what the ordinary person agrees

192
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,940
to in their ordinary course of dealing

193
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,009
and as a lawyer I try to read as many of

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,990
these Terms of Service as possible but

195
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:17,639
it's simply impossible to read them all

196
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,259
it's it's it's a it's a bit baffling how

197
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,530
we could be in that situation you still

198
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:27,210
get other things done I try how does

199
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,729
free software protect how does software

200
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,258
freedom protect user freedom so having

201
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,819
introduced myself as a lawyer and nobody

202
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:37,529
threw anything at me so that was pretty

203
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:42,300
exciting so free software is is

204
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:46,200
predicated on copyright raise your hand

205
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,779
if you have read a free software license

206
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,820
at some point so it's like three

207
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,860
quarters of the audience raise your hand

208
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,130
if you have never heard of copyleft and

209
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,690
it's totally okay because

210
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,339
there are always people who haven't you

211
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,300
know you have to hear about it raise

212
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,350
your hand if you've never heard of

213
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,329
copyleft so a couple of people so so

214
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,329
free software is totally predicated on a

215
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:10,239
legal concept and the idea is using

216
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:12,399
copyright but to keep up copyright which

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,720
generally restricts software and

218
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,089
restricts what you can share it

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,449
copyright creates effectively a monopoly

220
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,550
over the work copyright applies simply

221
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:23,050
when you when you write the software

222
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,729
when you write the copyrighted work it

223
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,939
arises you don't have to do anything to

224
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,470
get it if you fix your work and if

225
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,589
you're if you fix a work of tangible

226
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,110
creative expression that is when your

227
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,360
copyright arises and it's a very low bar

228
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,750
for copyright ability and so once you

229
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,480
have that copyright you can use that

230
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,550
copyright slash monopoly ish system but

231
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,529
to share your work instead and that is

232
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,040
where these free and open source

233
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,930
software licenses come to play so copy

234
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,670
so free and open source software means

235
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,310
software with those freedoms that we

236
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,130
identified before the ability to use to

237
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:03,250
to share to make changes and to share

238
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,410
those changes what what those licenses

239
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,209
do is they provide a legal framework for

240
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,139
doing it and there are a variety of

241
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:13,719
different licenses there's the two

242
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:16,360
general categories are copyleft and non

243
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,630
copyleft and copyleft is a really cool

244
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,550
concept it's the idea of using copyright

245
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,430
but to keep software free and to keep so

246
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,250
in other words if you use a copyleft

247
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,630
license you say you can do whatever you

248
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,250
want with this software and this is

249
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,560
really shorthand but you can do whatever

250
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,990
you want with this software provided

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,939
that if you make changes and distribute

252
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,850
those changes you do so under the same

253
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:42,699
license so it's a detractors have called

254
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,880
it viral in the past but now viral is

255
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:48,189
actually a good term but I like to think

256
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,769
of it as Forever Free or a snowballing

257
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:53,319
effect so once you release your software

258
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,699
under a copyleft license it creates this

259
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,029
body of software that grows and grows

260
00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:03,279
that many people contribute to so the

261
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:05,410
very nature of free software of free and

262
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,540
open source software is predicated on a

263
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,019
legal hack and it's a I think it's a

264
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,230
it's a real

265
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:15,730
cool one so the way that we define what

266
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,309
counts as a free license or an

267
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,319
open-source license is that we have put

268
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,699
our trust into two organizations the

269
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,618
Free Software Foundation in the open

270
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:24,849
source initiative who each maintained a

271
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:27,160
canonical list so the Free Software

272
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,259
Foundation maintains a canonical list of

273
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,679
free software licenses while the OSI

274
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,239
maintains one of open source licenses

275
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,089
what we've done is these organizations

276
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:40,199
look at how given license that's

277
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:43,869
proposed to them fits into maintaining

278
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,508
user software freedom and then makes the

279
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,699
decision to either approve it or not

280
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:50,410
based on that criteria so when some

281
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,819
things is calling itself free or

282
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,350
open-source when it's using one of those

283
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,849
licenses that's when we know that

284
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,879
there's really integrity in the

285
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,339
technology those license lists are

286
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,899
predicated on definitions so those two

287
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,149
organizations actually Molly is

288
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:07,239
affiliated with both of them I'm doubly

289
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,549
qualified to talk about this and I'm

290
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:11,199
simply pro bono counsel sometimes to the

291
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:13,959
Free Software Foundation that may mean

292
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:15,819
that I'm not qualified at all since I

293
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:18,040
don't have any position of authority at

294
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:22,389
either organization but that was a bad

295
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,420
joke but but so so those those those

296
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:26,829
lists are predicated on a review of the

297
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,929
definitions there's an open source

298
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,089
definition and a free software

299
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:33,790
definition and what's interesting is

300
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,589
that the open source definition comes

301
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,540
directly from the free software

302
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,279
definition so they're not like two

303
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,209
separate things that have been developed

304
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,480
independently the open source definition

305
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:48,008
was originally came from the the Debian

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,069
free software guidelines and that was a

307
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:52,990
way to write down an interpretation of

308
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:55,748
the four of the of the free software

309
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,970
definition and so both have kind of been

310
00:12:55,749 --> 00:13:00,100
tweaked a little bit in the interim but

311
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,019
generally those license lists are

312
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,850
overlapping there are a historical one

313
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,679
or two instances where something might

314
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,540
not be approved by both but if it is

315
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,459
approved by both and almost all of the

316
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,799
licenses that appear on one here on the

317
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,199
other you can pretty much know that it's

318
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,669
a free and open source and if you'd like

319
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,109
to talk about Debian's role in this

320
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,459
later both Karen and I are very

321
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,340
enthusiastic about the Debian project

322
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,680
and happy to talk about it

323
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,620
[Laughter]

324
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,229
which brings me to the discussion of

325
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,080
terminology of using free software using

326
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,520
the term open-source software I do want

327
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,470
to take a note and say this because I

328
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,260
think many people have only heard the

329
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,050
term open-source and what I have found

330
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,720
in the course of my work in this field

331
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,670
is that different people think that

332
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,830
they're saying different things when

333
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,270
they say free software or open source

334
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,970
software and what they think they mean

335
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,250
differs from person to person so I've

336
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,530
heard people think that free software

337
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,420
means a copy software released under a

338
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,250
copyleft license and some people think

339
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,500
open source is a non copyleft license or

340
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,560
some people call it permissive or lacks

341
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,870
permissive some people think that free

342
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,390
software refers to ideology and open

343
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,360
source only refers to collaborative

344
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,580
business models but I've heard this but

345
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,130
but some people use open source as an

346
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,770
ideological description of what they're

347
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,200
doing and some people use use free

348
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,340
software to describe all of the use of

349
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,620
free and open source software in the

350
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,510
field and so often I like to say free

351
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,380
and open because both terms are

352
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,610
sometimes a little bit Ken if you look

353
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,350
at them on their face without the

354
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,870
knowledge that we have you might think

355
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,900
that that the open source for example

356
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,640
only refers to being able to look at the

357
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,660
code not necessarily having any rights

358
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,640
to modify it so I think it's just very

359
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,280
so long as we are very clear that we are

360
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,930
talking about freedom I think that

361
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,390
that's the most important thing I like

362
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,250
the term software freedom I also work at

363
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,360
the software freedom Conservancy but

364
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,760
there are other software freedom

365
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,050
organizations but I think as long as

366
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,960
we're very clear about what we're

367
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:09,189
talking about I think that that's what

368
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:11,080
really matters so free can also mean a

369
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,550
few things people say free as in beer

370
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,640
but I'm trying to move away from that

371
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,900
and make free isn't coffee happen so if

372
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,220
you want to make that happen with me

373
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:23,530
that'd be really great so so when we say

374
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,180
free software a lot of people actually

375
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,329
interpret the word free in a variety of

376
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,569
ways all which are accurate to some

377
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,730
extent depending on the case so a lot of

378
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,820
free software is is gratis

379
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,760
it's available at no cost all free

380
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,380
software is free as in freedom and a lot

381
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,720
of free software is also free as in

382
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,399
kittens where you see this thing and it

383
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,930
seems really great and then you take it

384
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,699
home and suddenly you realize you need

385
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,500
to maintain it and feed it and take care

386
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,880
of it and sometimes it will still come

387
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,149
and try to eat your face in the middle

388
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,279
of the night I would say that outside of

389
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,990
English or other languages don't have

390
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,699
this problem necessarily some languages

391
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,790
have the term Libre or an equivalent

392
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:08,979
which which stands for freedom but I

393
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,750
found that in the US if you talk about

394
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:16,350
Libre software people think you're

395
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:19,510
talking about their horoscope so

396
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:22,360
software freedom is as I said essential

397
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,880
it's we were both you know really

398
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,519
dedicating our lives to working on free

399
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,389
software so it's great it's important

400
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,820
but it can't be the only answer so we

401
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,529
know that all software is vulnerable

402
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,319
just because software is free and open

403
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,720
doesn't mean it's better or safer i

404
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,029
want.i it actually makes it very tough

405
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,889
to explain the issue and tough to

406
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,560
advocate for it because I want to stand

407
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,350
up on stage and say free software is

408
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,969
awesome it's better it's safer if you

409
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,699
use free software everything's gonna be

410
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,829
fine an excellent but the truth is that

411
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:59,229
all software has vulnerabilities and all

412
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,000
software has problems the thing is what

413
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,860
do we do when we have a problem and

414
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,559
that's where software freedom really

415
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,929
matters so I think that you have to view

416
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,480
software freedom in the context of our

417
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:12,160
overall technology and understand that

418
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,980
it's not the only thing it's a

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,540
cornerstone of ethical technology but it

420
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:24,520
can't be the only piece of it so why is

421
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,199
user freedom important Karen well use

422
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,139
our freedoms and important to me because

423
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:33,540
I have this defibrillator right I mean

424
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,250
so addressing my own mortality and

425
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,168
finding out that I had a two to three

426
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,150
percent chance per year of dying and

427
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:43,600
that it compounded and being diagnosed

428
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:47,480
at age 31 was extremely daunting I'm a

429
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,639
very logical and fact driven

430
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:56,150
person and the stats on my longevity

431
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,370
were quite alarming and the the doctors

432
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,929
said but it's not a problem because you

433
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,090
can have this defibrillator and then

434
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:04,250
everything will be fine and to which I

435
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,678
asked well what does it run and they

436
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,150
said runt and I said well yeah this

437
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,990
device has software on it and they said

438
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:14,419
software and so having this software

439
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,610
literally sewn into my body and screwed

440
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,890
into my heart has made me realize that

441
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,899
having some kind of control over it not

442
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,970
even being able to look at it and

443
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,700
knowing that that software is in my body

444
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,700
has been a really poignant experience

445
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,370
and once you have that experience it's a

446
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,040
very short walk from medical devices to

447
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,290
cars in which we entrust our lives every

448
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,450
day and from cars to voting machines to

449
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,940
stock markets and while we live in an

450
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,460
Internet of Things where we're only as

451
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,990
safe as our weakest link suddenly while

452
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,120
everything is talking to everything else

453
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,340
much more of our software becomes really

454
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,439
important from a critical security and a

455
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,709
personal view so for me it is just this

456
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,350
deeply personal issue that I basically

457
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,059
can never escape

458
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,830
so before writing this talk I thought I

459
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,840
cared about user freedom and software

460
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,299
freedom from this very high view of

461
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,760
society and how that's this us as a

462
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:10,940
society we're at risk and technology is

463
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,820
this extremely pervy technology is so

464
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,160
pervasive it's everywhere in Karen's

465
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,870
case it's in her body I think my knees

466
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,950
are gonna get replaced someday and and

467
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,979
who knows what they'll be doing with

468
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,570
knees at that point you know it's in our

469
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,960
pockets how many of you have a device on

470
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,330
you that's really a computer yeah I

471
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,600
think I I don't right now but mine's

472
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,830
right here it's nearby so I used to

473
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,809
think that I really only cared about it

474
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,049
at this level and in doing this talk I

475
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:41,750
realized that I actually have this like

476
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:43,730
extremely deep visceral reaction and

477
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,100
understanding that's so little of my

478
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,090
experience actually belongs to me and so

479
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,830
little of my experience is something

480
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,809
that I'm controlling right and whether

481
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,549
we're talking about the like the

482
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,799
Promoted Tweets that we see on Twitter

483
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:59,120
which like I definitely look at and use

484
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,220
a lot to things like even what's

485
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,719
controlling the street lights outside

486
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,760
like these aren't experiences that I

487
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,530
have ever really been given the

488
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,090
opportunity to consent to other than by

489
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,510
deciding that I want to interact with

490
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:13,010
the world yeah I think we're all in the

491
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,260
process of becoming a nun becoming

492
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,510
cyborgs in different ways for me my

493
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,059
technology is always implanted but we

494
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,650
interact with all of our technology in

495
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,629
different ways than that line that

496
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,610
blurry line between where we end and

497
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,330
where our technology begins gets

498
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,860
blurrier and blurrier every year so

499
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,168
there are also a lot of personal reasons

500
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,149
why you should care about software

501
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,169
freedom and user freedom if you don't

502
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:42,620
already so one of them is the right to

503
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:45,650
repair or to have your your technology

504
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,989
repaired a lot of cars for example today

505
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,559
rely on proprietary software and you

506
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,539
have to bring your car to your dealer in

507
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,280
order to get your car repaired if you

508
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:58,908
have a problem which means that you have

509
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,039
to rely on an authorized dealer and not

510
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:02,720
be able to repair the car yourself you

511
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,640
wouldn't necessarily even be able to go

512
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,890
to a skilled mechanic who didn't have

513
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,200
who wasn't you didn't have a license

514
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,530
from that from that car manufacturer for

515
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,960
the proprietary software and and and

516
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,450
we're still you may have to bring it to

517
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,370
a dealer but only certain dealers so the

518
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,080
the right and I love using the right to

519
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,449
repair as an example of why you would

520
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,460
care about user freedom or software

521
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,370
freedom because gosh darn it it's so

522
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,150
American I'm like I should have a right

523
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,070
to repair my car or my tractor or my

524
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,400
heart device or anything that we

525
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,320
possibly rely on they're specializing

526
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,780
the tools to fit your needs I think this

527
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,870
is one that matters to a lot of hackers

528
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,490
especially when you're using something

529
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,100
and it's not quite working the way you

530
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,590
want it to one example of this is key

531
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,600
bindings right so if you want to change

532
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,370
your key bindings if you want to make it

533
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,418
so that when you hit caps lock it does

534
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:02,270
something different than make the

535
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:04,940
letters all big that's a key binding in

536
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:09,500
general for safety and security and

537
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:12,730
Trust so we cannot have companies single

538
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,890
companies in particular be in control of

539
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,870
our basic safety and six

540
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,670
what we have right now is the exact

541
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,219
we've got it all wrong

542
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,500
right now we have mostly devices that

543
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,540
have proprietary software that we can't

544
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,460
review and we can't control and we can't

545
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,320
change when something goes wrong but we

546
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,210
also have no appreciable security on a

547
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,740
lot of those devices my defibrillator is

548
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,990
a good example of that there's no

549
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,030
encryption no password protection it's

550
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,460
the worst of both worlds right

551
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,680
what we need is real security and also

552
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,480
free and open source software so that we

553
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,830
can we can have some control over our

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,380
basic technology most of the most of the

555
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,610
great security tools are based on free

556
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,810
and open source software or are free and

557
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,639
open source software because you can't

558
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,639
let one entity control the keys only

559
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,240
what if that company gets purchased what

560
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,610
if through no ill will the company goes

561
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,750
out of business I want to make sure that

562
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:10,159
the the my defibrillator for example

563
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,960
isn't controlled just by a single

564
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,730
medical device manufacturer there's also

565
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,380
trusting who's in charge of a company

566
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,580
you might have one particularly great

567
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:21,170
CEO or CTO or CEO o or C something else

568
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,750
who's like taking these great ethical

569
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,100
stances that we all get really into but

570
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,660
then if it switches and someone else is

571
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,550
in charge suddenly everything might

572
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,680
change completely so here's a great

573
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,399
example and I wasn't planning to talk

574
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,180
about this but but people many

575
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,450
developers who were committed to freedom

576
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:43,280
were had no problem adopting github and

577
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,110
just a lot of their software and github

578
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,270
and then suddenly when github was

579
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,699
acquired by Microsoft there was an

580
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,700
uproar about whether or not that was the

581
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,250
end of the trust ability of github but

582
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,410
once you entrust your software to to a

583
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,650
system like that it's a you you know

584
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,760
what you're getting and there's no no

585
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,530
[Music]

586
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,260
you know slide on it either company it's

587
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,810
just it is what it is right and if you

588
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,180
you just have no idea what's gonna

589
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:14,510
happen to a company down the road I

590
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,680
think the very idea that I'm just

591
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,790
because I don't think that Microsoft is

592
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,590
any different than a lot of the

593
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,940
companies that have proprietary software

594
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,659
companies that use free and open-source

595
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,610
software in our field but somehow the

596
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,740
people react to the name and the history

597
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,590
and I think that that it's just a great

598
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,150
example

599
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,770
you don't know it could be an

600
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,880
acquisition by another company but it

601
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,280
could also just be a change in

602
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,810
leadership so we have to look we have to

603
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,000
be very forward-looking with respect to

604
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:43,770
who we trust for our software and our

605
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,880
technology in general ah and and

606
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:51,450
similarly the right to privacy is is is

607
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,540
by definition such a personal thing I

608
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,180
know that for example my defibrillator

609
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,830
by default would be broadcasting and so

610
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,670
when I got a new defibrillator last year

611
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,590
I had a hard time finding one that was

612
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,150
not constantly broadcasting so if

613
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,570
anyone's trying to look for my

614
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:13,290
defibrillator I was able to disable my

615
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,750
my wireless component in software but I

616
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,460
got the only defibrillator available in

617
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,710
the US market where you can do that

618
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,770
there was only one and it was only made

619
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,440
available by a small a small in the u.s.

620
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,450
manufacturer which to me is terrifying

621
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,200
we're connecting all of the things we

622
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:33,300
don't even realize what's talking to to

623
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,550
what what technology is talking to other

624
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,290
technology and the the the fact is that

625
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,490
people don't even realize that that

626
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,700
they're broadcasting in this way we need

627
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,470
a right to not broadcast but we need we

628
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,560
need to examine our right to privacy in

629
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,120
this overall ethical technology

630
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,889
construct and think about user freedom

631
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:55,860
accordingly and it's a real reason why

632
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:57,930
you should care about user freedom free

633
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,850
soft freedom of expression and safe

634
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,550
spaces so safe space is to develop those

635
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,399
ideas is also predicated on software

636
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:07,470
freedom and user freedom I've since

637
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,690
especially I'm sure for many of you in

638
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,820
this room I know for myself a lot of my

639
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,920
ideas have really been developed in

640
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:20,060
digital spaces whether it's been on IRC

641
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:23,100
or over signal chats or whatsapp and I

642
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,780
need to have those spaces in order to

643
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,370
develop my ideas and in order to be able

644
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,970
to communicate things and communicate

645
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,379
them safely and confidently and if we

646
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,960
can't trust the tools that we're using

647
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,200
to have these conversations then we're

648
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,480
in a pretty dangerous place it turns out

649
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,220
yeah I want to add that it's not

650
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,290
necessarily free

651
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,260
free software and user freedom doesn't

652
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,960
necessarily or soccer freedom doesn't

653
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,160
necessarily make the space free I do

654
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,340
want to acknowledge that we sometimes

655
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,080
have toxic personalities in in the field

656
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,540
and they don't necessarily create safe

657
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,730
spaces but you can't have an overall

658
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:06,030
framework of safe spaces and free speech

659
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:07,500
without free software fundamentally and

660
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,389
and the thing is that we don't even know

661
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,270
how a lot of our technology is gonna be

662
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,850
used so for example what I got my

663
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,470
defibrillator I don't want to say how

664
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,760
old I am but I got my first afib relator

665
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:24,540
awhile ago um I I thought that it was

666
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,700
more about auditability and I didn't I I

667
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,520
thought that my story was basically done

668
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,950
but as I've lived my life with my

669
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,040
defibrillator it's become relevant in

670
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,580
unexpected ways so for example I was

671
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,210
pregnant

672
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,429
and about a quarter of all pregnant

673
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,960
women have palpitations that means their

674
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,100
heartbeats kind of fast from time to

675
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,710
time with a little bit of a regularity

676
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,360
and when that happened to me which is

677
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,560
perfectly normal if you were someone

678
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,330
without a heart condition or without a

679
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,470
defibrillator and you went to the doctor

680
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,560
and you said I've been having these

681
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,450
palpitations a doctor would generally

682
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,860
say to a pregnant woman oh yes pregnant

683
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,350
women and often palpitate don't worry

684
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,909
about it but for me my defibrillator

685
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,429
thought that my heart was in a dangerous

686
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:09,510
rhythm and so it unnecessarily shocked

687
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:11,850
me twice and so I got shocked twice

688
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,950
because my device was trying to deliver

689
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,949
me unnecessary and unwanted treatment

690
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,990
and the only way to avoid that was to

691
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,280
take drugs to slow my heart rate down so

692
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,190
much that I could barely walk up a

693
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,879
flight of stairs and when I looked into

694
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,350
it I thought this can't be right it's so

695
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,190
common for pregnant women to have

696
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,449
palpitations but it turns out that fewer

697
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,740
than half of all the people who get

698
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,380
defibrillators are women

699
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,680
it's in like the low 40 percentages but

700
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,630
more importantly 85% of the people who

701
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,900
get defibrillators are over the age of

702
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,600
65 so the set of people who are pregnant

703
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,280
with defibrillators is just tiny and

704
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,610
being pregnant as a temporary condition

705
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,930
I promise you that the device

706
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,669
manufacturer

707
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,430
no interest in having pregnant ladies

708
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,900
getting shocked it's like any medical

709
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,490
device companies worst nightmare is

710
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,170
having their pregnant patients getting

711
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,670
shocked but it's just not on their radar

712
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,340
screen they just aren't thinking about

713
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,140
it because my use case wasn't what the I

714
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,500
wasn't the intended audience of my

715
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,180
device and this defibrillator the

716
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,830
representative tells me it should last

717
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,720
17 years a lot of our technology is

718
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,970
going to last a long time we're putting

719
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,700
all this technology especially connected

720
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,710
technology in our security systems and

721
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,420
our refrigerators and all kind of light

722
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,070
bulbs all kinds of devices that were

723
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,990
surrounding ourselves with for these

724
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,939
long with these long periods of time and

725
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,680
we have no idea how it's going to be

726
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,680
used it's going to be impossible for us

727
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,530
to predict the problems that we're going

728
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,300
to are going to arise and more so the

729
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,530
companies that made these devices are

730
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,320
going to go out of business their

731
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,370
products are going to end-of-life the

732
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,899
developers who worked on it at those

733
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,760
corporations are going to find new jobs

734
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,050
and those companies are not going to

735
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,270
keep great records they're not going to

736
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,980
keep good spurs code internally if we

737
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,139
don't get the complete and corresponding

738
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,340
source code for all of our technology

739
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,320
we'll never be able to fix the problem

740
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,480
as they happen and those problems are

741
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,480
getting more and more complex by the day

742
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,620
the need for user freedom is by

743
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,419
definition extremely personal so I hope

744
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,699
each of you in this room either have or

745
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,530
will have soon your own reason why user

746
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,030
freedom matters to you and this could be

747
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,040
because like Karen you have a heart

748
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,180
condition or like me you're scared of

749
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,810
what's gonna happen in the future to

750
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:30,450
society it could also be because maybe

751
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,730
you have a sibling with an accessibility

752
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,530
issue and you're very concerned that the

753
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,840
technology currently doesn't meet their

754
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,220
needs

755
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,020
it could be because you just have a

756
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,040
specialized need for your own tools and

757
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,590
you want it to work a little bit

758
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,850
differently than it currently is but

759
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,070
these are things that I really hope

760
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:51,540
you'll be thinking about and coming up

761
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,770
with so in addition to personal reasons

762
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,560
why free software matters there are also

763
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:58,110
lots of societal reasons right so racial

764
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,139
justice I'm not an expert in racial

765
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,240
justice or race issues but I do believe

766
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,820
that that is in fact a user freedom

767
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,280
issue when we look at how many

768
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,730
algorithms and AI how algorithms in AI

769
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,260
are

770
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,300
becoming this integral part to a lot of

771
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,690
how societies working whether or not

772
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:20,070
we're looking at something like

773
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:21,840
automatic faucets in bathrooms that have

774
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,110
trouble recognizing people with darker

775
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,429
skin tones or you're looking at say like

776
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,340
when Google facial recognition software

777
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,710
was confusing African Americans with

778
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,909
gorillas which is something I hope you

779
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,770
know about and if you don't you should

780
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:42,450
read about it I hear the problems been

781
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:43,800
fixed but here but but these are race

782
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,220
issues and these are free software

783
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:51,540
issues there are also issues of economic

784
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,670
justice this is thinking about so when

785
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,830
you think about economic justice I want

786
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,530
you to think about the economic

787
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,750
inequalities that exist and the ways

788
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,850
that we are currently interacting with

789
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,670
them how many of them are being driven

790
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:09,629
by technology whether or not we're

791
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:11,670
looking at how how immigrants who are

792
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,850
coming into the United States are being

793
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,980
assessed with ice recently it came out

794
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,120
that the algorithm algorithms they were

795
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,790
using in the checklists that they were

796
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,080
using to determine who was being allowed

797
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:28,230
into the u.s. wha

798
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,139
were redone secretly so that it listed

799
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,210
everyone as a potential threat who

800
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,980
needed to be detained but they weren't

801
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,330
talking about the people who are doctors

802
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,580
coming over from England they were

803
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:42,750
talking about the people who have

804
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,490
different socio-economic statuses and

805
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,170
then there's an important education

806
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,210
component because software freedom and

807
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,940
it's connected to some of the the

808
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,040
economic arguments as well but with with

809
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,690
software freedom comes the

810
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,450
democratization of Technology

811
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,750
so with software freedom anyone can

812
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,580
access their their software which allows

813
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,140
them to learn and to be able to

814
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,460
participate even if you don't have the

815
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,360
money to buy proprietary software

816
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,920
licenses raise your hand if your first

817
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,510
work out your first software thing that

818
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,090
you got took an interest in dug in on

819
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:18,300
was connected to a game I know what mine

820
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,909
was like yeah like a quarter of the

821
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,290
audience you know games are I used to

822
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,750
think that games weren't that

823
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,220
to the story of software freedom because

824
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,320
it was focused on these societal issues

825
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,210
but of course games are a way that a lot

826
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,860
of people get involved and if their

827
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,780
software freedom connected to those

828
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,620
games it allows people to dig in and to

829
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:41,220
and to bring that into their education

830
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,959
it's really important that educational

831
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,250
institutions have access to different

832
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,330
software and control over their software

833
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,240
now we're going to talk about companies

834
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:55,530
corporations and governments money

835
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,030
everybody likes money companies are

836
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,389
really interesting because they have a

837
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,950
real stake in free and open source

838
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,440
software raise your hand if you have a

839
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,480
company you have a job that Reaser going

840
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,510
to have a job that you have to use or

841
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,610
develop free software in some way and

842
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,030
that's like more than half of the

843
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,889
audience companies care about free and

844
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,960
open source software because it's super

845
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,540
useful to them it's very hard to get to

846
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,649
market without having without using a

847
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,600
tremendous amount of free and open

848
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,159
source software and they they have a

849
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:31,830
vested interest and they want to control

850
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:34,230
the they want to control the software

851
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,899
that that they're using in their

852
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:39,649
products but their interests may not be

853
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:43,230
aligned with the public's interests so

854
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:45,810
you know what they're focused on may not

855
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,918
be applied to every use case and through

856
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:52,139
no ill intention of those of those

857
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:54,658
companies they they may do things that

858
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,129
are in fact not at all what what we want

859
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,410
so it's great that they are so invested

860
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:00,960
we need companies to be using free and

861
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,790
open-source software in order for us to

862
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,990
succeed as a movement because if

863
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,220
companies aren't using free and

864
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,509
open-source software then we're left

865
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,459
with products without free and

866
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:12,090
open-source software but at the same

867
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,520
time we have to sort of step up and and

868
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:19,110
make sure that we demand more freedom in

869
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,630
our in our devices freeing code also

870
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,740
matters with things like uber and PayPal

871
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:27,390
these are actually two kind of divisive

872
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,310
examples but when you're thinking about

873
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,819
platforms it still matters because if

874
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:35,100
we're willing to give up software

875
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,380
freedom at one level

876
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,370
then the question is where are we going

877
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,130
to be drawing the line

878
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,380
so either you might say well PayPal is

879
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:46,290
dealing with a lot of secure financial

880
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,180
data and it's like great well maybe cars

881
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,340
should also be something that we don't

882
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,960
have access to because cars are multiple

883
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,480
time killing machines that are going

884
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,070
around on the streets or well if we're

885
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,160
gonna also then have cars as this

886
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,720
protected class of technology maybe we

887
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,549
should and then you just kind of work

888
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,899
your way down and then suddenly you

889
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:08,010
actually don't have any software freedom

890
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:10,290
anywhere oh yeah this is a picture of

891
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,080
the cat guarding the fish store we just

892
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:17,340
need to move we we just need to make

893
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:19,830
sure that the that we give ourselves the

894
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,650
power and the tools so that we can

895
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:25,560
influence influence that gatekeeping and

896
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,480
make sure that our technology has our

897
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,190
interests at heart and also the the

898
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,620
corporate interests because companies

899
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,320
will find a way to profit off of the

900
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,759
software that we make available to them

901
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,320
but we don't necessarily have to give

902
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,230
too much and as Molly says it's a

903
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,420
slippery slope so making sure that that

904
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,440
we we stand firm and demand freedom

905
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,120
wherever we can is really important

906
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,860
there's also to take this idea of

907
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,529
corporate stuff too with another example

908
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,480
in a personal issue

909
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,580
this is era papers all also known as

910
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,010
abilify which is now available with a

911
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,960
sensor in it the sensor then will talk

912
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,880
to your phone which will talk to your

913
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,910
doctor and inform your doctor when

914
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,780
you've taken it and how long it's taken

915
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,730
to disperse into your system so this

916
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,480
means you have like there's a bunch of

917
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,560
things wrong with this right and to very

918
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,530
quickly try to go over them because

919
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,420
we're running low on time so this is

920
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,740
trusting the security of your phone for

921
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,630
example your phone is like a part of

922
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,250
this process and that's like super scary

923
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,420
already because we're having trouble

924
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,250
trusting things like voting machines

925
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,530
then we want to look at like trusting

926
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,030
your doctor it's when we one of the

927
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,470
things when we talk about software is we

928
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,630
talk on proprietary software as we

929
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,609
talked about lock-in and how once you're

930
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,020
using a piece of technology you might

931
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,940
not be able to use another piece of

932
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,280
technology that does effectively the

933
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,359
same thing because of file formats

934
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,190
because

935
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,200
your history is built into this one tool

936
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,700
and it's kind of the same thing where

937
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,470
you end up in a situation where maybe

938
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,730
you have to keep using the same doctor

939
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,980
even if that doctor is not the right

940
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,720
person for you because they have access

941
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,369
to all this information and you've built

942
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,288
up this particular reliance with them

943
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:06,150
I'm locked into my defibrillator because

944
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,440
it's sewn into my body but I should be

945
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,089
able to choose whatever medical

946
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,869
professionals I want to to be able to

947
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:15,808
adjust it and right now I can't so this

948
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,880
is representative of the government I'm

949
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:21,450
glad someone left I'm here for you Molly

950
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,769
yeah I'm actually not going to talk

951
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,180
about governments being evil I'm going

952
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:28,379
to talk about pro production of software

953
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,879
so in the u.s. we have this really great

954
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,160
thing where things that are produced by

955
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,749
the government belong to the people this

956
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,239
should also be true for the code

957
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:37,379
produced by the US government we're kind

958
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,470
of lucky in that there's this thing

959
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,900
called the u.s. called the federal

960
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:45,118
source code policy which is beginning to

961
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,200
tackle that issue but it's also

962
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,269
important to make sure that the

963
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,649
fundamental technologies that we're

964
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:52,288
building everything else on that's

965
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:57,180
governing us are free and respect us as

966
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:59,549
users one of the great tools that we can

967
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,899
use in order to help us with with making

968
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:02,519
sure that there aren't shady things

969
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,269
happening in the background is is

970
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,939
copyleft which is the tool the licensing

971
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:10,499
tool that we talked about before

972
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,239
copyleft which requires that if you're

973
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:14,098
distributing the software that you

974
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,890
distribute along with that software

975
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,509
software the the source code or an offer

976
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,118
to that source code that is good and

977
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:24,749
exercisable and what's important about

978
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,630
copyleft is that it helps it if if if

979
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:29,098
someone is is using the software in Ana

980
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,869
dubious way and you can examine the

981
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,279
source code you stand a chance of

982
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,839
possibly being able to find it and

983
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:36,539
possibly being able to modify it it's

984
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,849
not a slam dunk again I really want to

985
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:41,940
say that free software is just better

986
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,079
and safer period but these are

987
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,239
complicated issues there could be

988
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,789
backdoors that we don't pick up when we

989
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,739
review the source code but once we find

990
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,569
out that there's a problem being able to

991
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:54,599
identify it and being able to do

992
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:56,849
something about it is is only possible

993
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,980
with software freedom when I talk with

994
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:00,250
people about licensing and license

995
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,920
approval one of the

996
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,480
common things I hear is well what if I

997
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,170
want well I want to I want to make a

998
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,020
free software license but but I wanted

999
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,790
to include a clause saying do no evil

1000
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,620
that's kind of why we have copyleft it

1001
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,020
doesn't actually keep people from doing

1002
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,670
no evil but what it does mean is that if

1003
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,340
say a government is doing something

1004
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,350
totally insidious with the technology

1005
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,420
that's already free software that's

1006
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,370
already copyleft they then in turn have

1007
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,380
to share what they've done this doesn't

1008
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:31,810
protect you from what's been going on

1009
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:35,050
but it does make it so that you can know

1010
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:36,850
what's happening even and hopefully give

1011
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,590
your consent well and it's not

1012
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:42,339
necessarily connected to copyleft

1013
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:45,520
generally but but the GPL suite of

1014
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,140
licenses is is great and I should

1015
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,570
mention actually that software freedom

1016
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,339
Conservancy is license agnostic we are

1017
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,930
home of lots of free and open-source

1018
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,700
software projects some of them are

1019
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:58,450
copyleft some of them are non copyleft

1020
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:01,419
but personally what I like about the GPL

1021
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,490
suite of licenses is that it requires

1022
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,250
complete and corresponding source code

1023
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:08,799
so it's the complete source code and the

1024
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,690
scripts to to build and install it and

1025
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,430
that's really important for having any

1026
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:16,660
appreciable freedom with respect to the

1027
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:21,129
software we use in summary we like

1028
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,450
copyleft big fans recommend it cool so

1029
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,190
there are lots of things that you can do

1030
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:27,120
to help free software user freedom and

1031
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:31,210
software freedom here's a wonderful list

1032
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,350
we are basically over time so a few

1033
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,550
minutes for questions what we can run

1034
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,710
through these really really quickly

1035
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:38,740
we'll take we'll go yeah you can work on

1036
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,300
projects please ask questions nobody

1037
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,069
wants to be the one creating that

1038
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,960
terrible dystopia that we're going to

1039
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,910
live in so if you're working in a

1040
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,290
technology company ask questions about

1041
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,700
the ethics of the products you're

1042
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,290
working on ask questions about the

1043
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,930
software and the software licensing a

1044
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:55,180
question can really just change the

1045
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,799
tenor of the conversation teach others

1046
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,149
this means teaching others both about

1047
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,410
user freedom but also about free

1048
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,910
software helping them learn to use

1049
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,799
something can make it easier and a lot

1050
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,560
less scary and it's also an important

1051
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,660
step in the proliferation and advocate

1052
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,480
just don't just take these ideas for

1053
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:12,430
granted use free software tools use free

1054
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,109
software tools in your life and weather

1055
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,788
and when you're building free software

1056
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:17,380
because if we don't have good free

1057
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,930
software we're not actually gonna be

1058
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,160
able to get anybody else to use it

1059
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,859
please negotiate your employment

1060
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,149
contract a lot of people take jobs and

1061
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,558
with the understanding that they're

1062
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,809
gonna work on free and open-source

1063
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,700
software and their jobs ask for that to

1064
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:33,730
be put in your contract consider asking

1065
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,470
your company if you can can you can hold

1066
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,930
the copyrights that you write within the

1067
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,660
context of your employment having that

1068
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:43,118
conversation can really propel the the

1069
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,950
the if companies want to recruit the

1070
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,589
best talent and if lots of developers

1071
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,999
are asked or contributors are asking for

1072
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:50,499
these things companies will start to

1073
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:53,319
move in order to attract better talent

1074
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:55,180
you can ask Karen about this later with

1075
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,180
contract patch which is a Conservancy

1076
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,919
project shameless plug and on the note

1077
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,069
of shameless plugs you can also support

1078
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,180
organizations with both time and money

1079
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:05,589
organizations like the software freedom

1080
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,808
Conservancy and the Free Software

1081
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:09,819
Foundation are member driven where lots

1082
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:11,799
of our funding comes from our members

1083
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:13,630
are member donations and our member fees

1084
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:15,220
and support we simply wouldn't survive

1085
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,739
without donations from individuals but

1086
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:25,058
enough Schilling yes okay five minutes

1087
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:27,819
left thank you very much thanks and we'd

1088
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,989
love twins if you want to queue up at

1089
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:30,430
the microphone that would be great

1090
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,960
I also especially encourage questions

1091
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,339
from people who don't normally ask them

1092
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,660
or haven't asked them before and if you

1093
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:36,130
make a statement not a question I'm

1094
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,480
going to interrupt you so if you've

1095
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,210
never asked a question before just jump

1096
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,900
to the front of the line I haven't asked

1097
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,049
a question

1098
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,549
so Karen can you just tell the technical

1099
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:46,569
details of how you were able to disable

1100
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:50,170
the wireless module on your

1101
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:52,089
defibrillator so I wish that I wish that

1102
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,369
I were able to do it myself but the

1103
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:56,799
truth is that I so what was fascinating

1104
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:59,589
was going into my electrophysiologist

1105
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:03,160
office and saying okay so here are my

1106
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:04,660
issues and and so first I was like okay

1107
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,519
I want to get a device manufacturer

1108
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,049
where I know I can get access to my

1109
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,368
source code or at least have the ability

1110
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:12,519
to negotiate it can you help me with

1111
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:15,519
that and they were like I guess I don't

1112
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:17,319
know and then and then I said and I

1113
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,379
definitely want to be able to disable

1114
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:21,940
the wireless functionality preferably in

1115
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,269
hardware and I heard that Dick Cheney

1116
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,480
had it done so that wasn't the case when

1117
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:30,180
I heard soap so can I have that too

1118
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,500
and I got laughed at basically because

1119
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,290
that is not something that you can do

1120
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,180
and and what the device manufacturer

1121
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,650
what the technician did with me it was

1122
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,500
she called all of the device

1123
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,210
manufacturers on speakerphone with me

1124
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,310
which was amazing of her and I was able

1125
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,950
to go through each each company and ask

1126
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,270
them about the do you have any that

1127
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,799
aren't broadcasting wirelessly can i

1128
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,170
disable it in hardware can we do that

1129
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,170
prior to getting it implanted and the

1130
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,730
answer was you know no are you kidding

1131
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,380
me off yeah you can learn more to bet

1132
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,820
more about yeah story from Karen's

1133
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,800
handlers keynote at Linux come for

1134
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,840
Australia 2018 I was want to say that

1135
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:09,540
bio tronic said that their devices were

1136
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:11,220
hack proof nice thank you hi

1137
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,680
we seem to be in a state where the

1138
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,240
default licensing model is the users

1139
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,220
can't do anything except what they're

1140
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,629
told they're able to do are you aware of

1141
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,520
many licensing models that are the

1142
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,050
opposite where users can do anything

1143
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,480
other than what they're told they can't

1144
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:28,619
explicitly do and do you know why that's

1145
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:37,820
not a more common model the only thing I

1146
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:41,340
can think of is the D WTF why W license

1147
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:43,050
I mean I think most of the free and open

1148
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,730
source software licenses that are OSI

1149
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:50,550
and oh s I approved in FSF recognized as

1150
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,609
free allow you to to generally do

1151
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:55,560
whatever you want with them and then III

1152
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:58,529
don't usually recommend that license

1153
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,500
because it's a it's a problem in that

1154
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:03,750
one it's often edited out in terms of

1155
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,580
when you refer to it and also because it

1156
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:10,170
has no disclaimer of warranties I see a

1157
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:16,410
lotta hashman at the end do you want to

1158
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:18,780
jump to the front great sorry for

1159
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:21,420
cutting the line so I had a question

1160
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,280
about you mentioned like this this case

1161
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,109
in which like if you have free software

1162
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,170
and you have a bad actor like you know a

1163
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:30,029
government or something like even say a

1164
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,920
large corporation that then violates the

1165
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,930
terms of that license at least it's free

1166
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,470
so maybe you can see that happening like

1167
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,730
what is there to compel them to like if

1168
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,169
they're already breaking the terms of

1169
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,810
the license what they're doing nefarious

1170
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,250
things

1171
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,130
what is there to compel them to like

1172
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,480
actually make that source code visible

1173
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,670
to like you know demonstrate that

1174
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,590
there's a problem so a license that

1175
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,660
requires people don't do nefarious

1176
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:56,650
things with technology is not a free

1177
00:46:52,660 --> 00:47:00,069
license yes but if they if for people

1178
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:02,890
who don't follow the terms of license we

1179
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,540
we run a way of doing license

1180
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,879
enforcement as copyright on behalf of

1181
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,170
copyright holders and and there are

1182
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,790
various ways that you can do that it's

1183
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,530
tougher with governments but having a

1184
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,710
public discussion about it is probably

1185
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,420
one of the first ways to do that

1186
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,200
Thanks we have like one more minute so

1187
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,920
last question

1188
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,259
real fast startup I controlled the

1189
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,220
software development for years I'd been

1190
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,220
able to do open source

1191
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,790
I finally got my non-technical

1192
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,590
colleagues to be okay with open source

1193
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,120
and champion it now I wanted to make the

1194
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,440
next move to free I'm just wondering if

1195
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,150
in the last thirty seconds you have any

1196
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,440
positive ways that you've seen that

1197
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,810
people have been able to make that last

1198
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,980
step to like GPL and make normal people

1199
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,270
think it's okay so this is another

1200
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,470
example of using free and open

1201
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,970
differently than I expect you mean

1202
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,709
you've been able to do non copy left and

1203
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,930
you want to do copy left exactly yeah

1204
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:53,160
talking about the long term business

1205
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:55,930
model of the software copy like using a

1206
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,270
using a non copyleft license or a weak

1207
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,680
copyleft license can allow other your

1208
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,860
competitors to have a competitive

1209
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,120
advantage but using using copy left it

1210
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,850
if you're releasing the code anyway

1211
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,319
releasing it under a strong copyleft

1212
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,700
license basically levels the playing

1213
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,420
field it means that your competitor

1214
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,160
can't take it

1215
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,820
fork it and then fragment the market

1216
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,560
awesome thanks thanks very much thanks

1217
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,650
and we'll be outside if anybody wants to

1218
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:23,820
ask more questions

1219
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,820
[Applause]
