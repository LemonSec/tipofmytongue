1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
okay so just for calibration has anyone

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,700
in the room either administered

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,719
installed or used to cure drop as a

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:17,220
journalist okay you don't like to pee oh

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,169
no we got a few people cool awesome so I

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,479
just wanted to understand how familiar

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,300
people are with the project and so today

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,060
I'm first going to make sure that we're

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,269
all on the same page by motivating why a

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,070
project like secure drop is necessary

11
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,780
and then I'll review how the system

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,570
currently works and then we're going to

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,739
talk a little bit about you might have

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,090
heard some things have changed in the

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,370
past couple of years so we'll discuss

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,390
how the landscape is changing both for

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,610
anonymous whistleblowing

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,920
and how secure drop is changing in

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,750
response and so then I'll discuss a

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,300
little bit some of the challenges that

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,879
users are facing using a very secure

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,640
system like this some that we think we

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,140
have good answers to and a plan for and

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,210
others that are open problems that I

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,480
hopefully will have plan to see it in

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,670
your mind to think about so first let's

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,539
motivate why a project like secure drop

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,710
is necessary or important so does anyone

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:18,150
know who this is no no okay we got one

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,030
so this is Mark felt and he's known in

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,920
the United States by his codename deep

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,840
throat and he was an anonymous source

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,299
that provided information to the

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,939
reporters Woodward and Bernstein during

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,060
the Watergate scandal and so this was a

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,649
situation that and this reporting

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,509
eventually led to the downfall of the

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,030
Nixon administration so this sources

39
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,950
activities clearly had a massive impact

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,930
at the time this person was providing

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,390
information to journalists he worked for

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,030
the government for the FBI and his

43
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,070
identity was kept secret for decades

44
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,549
even after the fact and simply because

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,130
the journalists refused to identify

46
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,750
their source and so that was the 1970s

47
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,839
and we live in a very different world

48
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,619
today unfortunately one that we talk

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
about a lot at conferences like this one

50
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,520
the implications of the fact that almost

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,580
every interaction between humans is

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,770
now mediated by some third party and a

53
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,110
third party is collecting data both of

54
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,460
the content and the metadata who is

55
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,560
talking to who which is what's most

56
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,950
important for and making contact between

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,810
sources and journalists so we know well

58
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,940
that there are telephone email and

59
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,520
messaging records held by these third

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,770
parties and the problem with this is

61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,980
that they can be subpoenaed to provide

62
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,080
records possibly without end-users even

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,940
being notified because these court

64
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,730
orders often have a gag associated with

65
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,200
them even meeting physically in the

66
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,549
modern age sometimes in response to this

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,950
people say oh you know you just meet

68
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,740
each other in the in the parking lot but

69
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,560
that's increasingly difficult because

70
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,630
these meetings in physical space also

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,980
produce a significant amount of data all

72
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,140
our cell phones are connected to the

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,720
same cell tower if you live in a place

74
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,179
like the UK or where there's widespread

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,240
use of automatic license plate readers

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,290
or ALP Oz then that tracks your movement

77
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,240
from within a city if you use a vehicle

78
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,489
there's also widespread use of CCTV and

79
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,980
facial recognition in many cities now so

80
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,170
just getting to that location without

81
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,200
producing a potentially identifying

82
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,899
trail that can be interrogated by leaked

83
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,970
investigators elite investigators that's

84
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,760
really the the fundamental problem so

85
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,650
making first contact as a journalist

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,820
with a source without producing this

87
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,870
metadata trail is a real challenge and

88
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,109
the the idea that the US government will

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,480
actually try to access this data to

90
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,810
identify journalistic sources is not

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,850
it's not a theoretical threat this is

92
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,310
something that did actually happen in

93
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,799
the Obama administration so the Obama

94
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,470
administration acquired the telephone

95
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,910
records in this case of journalists at

96
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,320
The Associated Press not just one

97
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,700
journalist a whole bunch of journalists

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,769
in order to try to identify a source and

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,329
under that administration there were a

100
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,530
record number of leak investigations

101
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,630
simply because I mean it's not the only

102
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,260
reason but it's certainly the case that

103
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,700
it's a lot easier to do this kind of in

104
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,180
Dean now because you have all of these

105
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,210
do you see places that you can go to get

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,680
data about who is talking to him so the

107
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,159
investigative methods are just much

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,900
better and more recently just last month

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,570
we have now seen the Trump

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,429
administration using this same tactic in

111
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,710
this case they issued a subpoena for the

112
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,690
telephone and email records of a New

113
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,409
York Times reporter to identify her

114
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,960
source

115
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,420
and so we need something that's going to

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,340
address this problem and restore the

117
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,910
balance because it's really shifted over

118
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,919
to leak investigators we need to make it

119
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,220
more difficult for leak investigators to

120
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,770
identify sources and so that's the goal

121
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,170
that the secure drop project aims to

122
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,120
address and so it's put pretty nicely by

123
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,340
this guy Charles Barrett who wrote a

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,790
report about secure drop a couple of

125
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,159
years ago where he describes the point

126
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,930
of the project as aiming to restore the

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,940
effectiveness of a reporter's privilege

128
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,010
to protect their sources through

129
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,660
principled non-cooperation and making

130
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:29,730
that a meaningful action so that's what

131
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,520
we set out to do so this is a project

132
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,130
that was originally created by the late

133
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,219
Aaron Swartz Kevin Paulson and the late

134
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,040
James Dolan about five years ago five

135
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,810
six years ago and was adopted by freedom

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,750
of the press foundation to continue

137
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,480
development as a free software project

138
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:52,020
and it was first actually announced at

139
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,110
Hope four years ago now you can check

140
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,099
out our snazzy new web site shown here

141
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,120
so now I'm briefly going to talk about

142
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,280
how we accomplished this and so then we

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,810
can go on and talk about deviations from

144
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,549
it so the role of the secure drop team

145
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,380
that maintained the software is we just

146
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,200
write the software we don't run any

147
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,090
secure drop instances individual and

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,070
news organizations or nonprofits that

149
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,810
are interested in having a leak channel

150
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,969
like secure drop we'll set it up at

151
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,230
their organization and so what that

152
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,700
means is they will get two servers which

153
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,120
they physically install at the

154
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,430
organization one that exposes two web

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,450
applications one that is used by sources

156
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,610
one that is used by journalists

157
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,090
and those are both only available as

158
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,740
tour onion services and then we have a

159
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,500
second server and the purpose of that

160
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,750
server is just to monitor the first so

161
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,020
if there's unusual activity someone's

162
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,880
logging in and that put the password in

163
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,060
wrong but generates an alert that gets

164
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,630
sent to administrators and so they enjoy

165
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,220
reading all of those lovely alerts then

166
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,020
we connect these two servers to a

167
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,970
network firewall and the purpose of that

168
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,260
is just to segment the secure drop part

169
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,950
of the network from the border news

170
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,770
organization these three devices are on

171
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,140
prem at the news org that might be in

172
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,150
the news organizations data center it

173
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,010
might be in the general counsel's office

174
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,520
or an editor's office but it's somewhere

175
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:25,090
that is physically secure and is a

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,609
first-party so if you know a news

177
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,330
organization got raided they would know

178
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,350
about it if they got a court order for

179
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,260
access to the secure table they would

180
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,290
know about it's such that they can fight

181
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,630
and that's what's really critical so

182
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:44,470
when people submit documents those are

183
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:48,580
encrypted to the GPG key that is

184
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:51,310
associated with each deployment and then

185
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,800
the only place where the private key is

186
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,660
stored is on a special computer and

187
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,710
we're going to great detail about how

188
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,180
that workflow works that machine is

189
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,820
called a secure viewing station we

190
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,940
remove all the network hardware at most

191
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:11,500
ways that one can exfiltrate data from

192
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:15,580
the workstation and journalists have to

193
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,460
ferry documents to that workstation so

194
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,810
briefly just to summarize the workflow

195
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:25,539
is as a journalist I connect to the web

196
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,180
application over at or I download my

197
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,970
documents I ferry them across using USB

198
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,710
or CD sneakernet to a secure viewing

199
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,070
station and then I open them and read

200
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:39,130
them and report on whatever is there and

201
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,860
most importantly sources also have to

202
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,980
use tor to connect to the server and

203
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,000
that's for their own protection so I

204
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,629
just want to underscore

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,069
if you don't use tor please do it really

206
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:56,779
is meaningful to protect sources for tor

207
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:58,279
to be common and mainstream so if you're

208
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,370
not using tor browser please go to

209
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:04,220
torpor torque down load it and use it it

210
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,470
really is meaningful cover traffic so to

211
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,199
get to this point as a source you need

212
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,089
to have the correct onion address of the

213
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:14,240
secure drop source interface so how do

214
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,839
you sources get that so in some cases

215
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,269
news organizations will point to secure

216
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,009
drop on their in their newspaper a

217
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,930
physical newspaper if they have one and

218
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,480
it might be on the front page as The

219
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,839
Globe and Mail does here or or in an add

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,540
some news organizations have done and

221
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,939
that generally points to a page on their

222
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,889
website which we call the secure drop

223
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:39,829
landing page which contains instructions

224
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:42,139
for non-technical sources how they can

225
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,449
get to the secure top source interface

226
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:47,029
so it's basically go download tor

227
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:49,550
browser type in this onion address boom

228
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:52,069
there you go it's pretty simple from

229
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,689
their sources perspective they don't

230
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:56,509
need to know what GPG is or anything

231
00:09:53,689 --> 00:10:00,379
like that which is the point and then we

232
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:02,809
maintain a directory on the secure web

233
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,389
site that you can filter by topic or a

234
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,949
language and we kind of have a backlog

235
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,329
we got a lot of them in here but there's

236
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:10,939
a lot being installed that we haven't

237
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:13,729
got in the directory yet so it's

238
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:16,610
something to be aware of so now let's

239
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,100
talk about how things have changed in

240
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:23,660
the past two years both for the project

241
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:27,769
and the political landscape this guy

242
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,660
unfortunately and so I can say from my

243
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,930
perspective so I started working on

244
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,949
secure drop right before the 2016

245
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,920
election and after chrome was elected we

246
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:42,349
basically started getting emails like

247
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,219
every day or every few days from news

248
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,230
organizations that you know maybe they

249
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,079
wanted securedoc before but really saw

250
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,490
the need in this and political climate

251
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,339
given some of the rhetoric that was

252
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,490
occurring for a leak channel like secure

253
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,010
draw so we have helped a lot of those

254
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,350
news organizations

255
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,260
contacted us to install secure drop so

256
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,450
this is a list of just the some of the

257
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,390
English language news at have adopted

258
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,800
secure drop just in the past two years

259
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,900
so we have a lot of big news

260
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,599
organizations using secured up among

261
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,579
other tools to get leaked documents

262
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,760
which is really sweet and we have a

263
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:24,400
backlog of orgs that once secured drop

264
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,110
but we're small team so we try to help

265
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,100
as many people as possible and if that's

266
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,780
something you would be interested in

267
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,800
helping people with and I encourage you

268
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:35,439
to do so and I was careful to specify

269
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,719
English language when I put the previous

270
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,090
slide up because secure drop is now

271
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,620
available in thirteen other languages in

272
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,930
addition to English those languages are

273
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,150
listed here and so if you read and write

274
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,189
a natural language that is not English

275
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,840
and even if it's one on this list

276
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,120
already I encourage you to help

277
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,590
translate and localize secure drop at

278
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,940
this link and the cool thing about this

279
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,770
localization the translation effort in

280
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,810
particular is that it was community led

281
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,620
so a lot of the people like contributed

282
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,150
translations were people that either run

283
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,710
secure drops and wanted to make it

284
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,000
available to sources that don't speak

285
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,770
English or news organizations that are

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,420
in a country that doesn't speak English

287
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,540
is its primary language and wanted to

288
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,670
make it available in their locale so one

289
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,589
of those orgs for example is al-jazeera

290
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,829
which now this is a source interface for

291
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,690
Algeciras instance and they have a nice

292
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,600
tips page now that includes secure drop

293
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,660
as one of the channels and along with

294
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,510
other tools so that's a pretty sweet

295
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,000
development so returning to the u.s.

296
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,660
u.s. context we've heard this term

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,070
thrown around the Golden Age of leaps

298
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,990
and that's primarily due to the

299
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,600
onslaught of leaks that have come from

300
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,060
the Trump Whitehouse exhibit meme levels

301
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,720
we've seen leaks about leaked documents

302
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,329
we've had meetings were journalists or

303
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,800
sorry people that are employed by the

304
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,150
Trump administration are being told not

305
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,089
to leak or the details of all that

306
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,550
leaked but it does seem like a lot of

307
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,270
people within government certainly at

308
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,490
least within the White House

309
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,370
seeing the value of having a channel to

310
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:20,600
talk to journalists to get information

311
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,170
out as a check on power and at least a

312
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,670
few of the this kind of story

313
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,229
related to the Trop administration have

314
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,420
come through secure drop

315
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,950
so in this Gizmodo story they got a

316
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,319
leaked phone call submitted through

317
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,760
their instance and in the forbes case

318
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,420
they were contacted by a source that

319
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,790
tipped him off to the story so for the

320
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,589
most part it continues to be the case

321
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,349
that news organizations do not say

322
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,209
publicly when a story comes through

323
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,980
secure draw which is the right thing to

324
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,839
do

325
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,580
so we discourage news orgs assembly in

326
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,430
cases where leak investigations are

327
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,310
likely to happen from stating publicly

328
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:02,359
or anywhere where a leak investigator

329
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,520
may have access to in the end you

330
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,660
shouldn't be talking about oh this

331
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,060
source came in through secured up

332
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,779
because that's very useful as an

333
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,790
investigator

334
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,320
there are many channels to which a

335
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,000
source can talk to a journalist and

336
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,610
there's always finite investigative

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,770
resources so we don't want to do

338
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,640
investigators work for them by saying

339
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,920
these other possible leads are all going

340
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,819
to be dead ends I'm trying to make it

341
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,680
their jobs harder so unfortunately even

342
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,300
though it's the golden age of leaks it's

343
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,969
also the golden age of leak

344
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,199
investigations so about a year ago now

345
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:41,600
there was a press conference which is

346
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,760
what this story is about was Jeff

347
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,290
Sessions who's the head of the United

348
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,950
States Department of Justice announced

349
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:53,810
they crack down on leaks that they are

350
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:56,540
setting out to stem the tide and we have

351
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,109
seen a big uptick in leak investigations

352
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,829
and several prosecution of sources so

353
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,680
far so if you are interested in hearing

354
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:08,870
more about the threats that journalists

355
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,089
are facing including leak investigations

356
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,279
I encourage you to go to this talk later

357
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,700
today which is about another project of

358
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,410
freedom of the press foundation called

359
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,570
the press freedom tracker which tracks

360
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,600
and reports on press freedom incidents

361
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,639
so some of the leak investigations that

362
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,920
have occurs for example reality winner

363
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,930
who if you don't know is an NSA

364
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,029
subcontractor who is one of the people

365
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,599
that has been charged for leaking

366
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:41,550
documents that will be discussed in this

367
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,949
talk so taking a step back for a second

368
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:49,079
I think it's worth thinking about what

369
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:50,758
the natural response is to a ecosystem

370
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,399
where it's easier than ever before to

371
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,500
leak documents if you're in the position

372
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,170
of people that want to protect the

373
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,130
information that your organization has

374
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,750
what can you do

375
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,939
so we've already discussed leak

376
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,399
investigations and that's certainly one

377
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,370
of the tactics that is useful figure out

378
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:13,160
who the leakers are and you know crush

379
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,290
them as a deterrent but you can also

380
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,519
encourage employees to report on one

381
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,839
another so you can have an insider

382
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,100
threat training program which is

383
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,350
something that a lot of US government

384
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,750
organizations are doing where they'll

385
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,240
teach people the warning signs when a

386
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,160
disgruntled employee has an iff sticker

387
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,360
on their laptop and might leak documents

388
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,120
super radical stuff and so this slide is

389
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,790
from a insider threat training which I

390
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,130
took for giggles and anyone can take it

391
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,180
it's public and in this particular

392
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,889
module they go through different

393
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,959
whistleblowers intermixed with people

394
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:53,760
that like sold US government secrets

395
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:57,839
together and talk about what the warning

396
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,649
signs were for edification and so for Ed

397
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,060
Snowden the main characteristic they

398
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,470
brought up was the habitual

399
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,158
non-compliance with the rules and

400
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,370
regulations so I you know this seems

401
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:15,329
like a common strategy another common

402
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:17,428
strategy is just to make sure that you

403
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,438
maintain observability of all the places

404
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:22,980
where you have secure documents

405
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,299
workstations for most organizations so

406
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,040
if you can improve monitoring and

407
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,689
alerting within the organization to make

408
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,980
it significantly harder to exfil

409
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,380
documents without detection

410
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,390
that's another pretty effective tactic

411
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,730
you can't get your

412
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,130
phone in the same room as the computer

413
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,720
that has the slideshow that you want to

414
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,460
leak and if it's the case that if you

415
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,040
insert a USB Drive it's going to get

416
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,990
logged then you've got a problem and

417
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,840
this is a list of events that are

418
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,200
suggested to be monitored according to

419
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,459
the 2017 threat insider guide and which

420
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,929
is a great weed huh yeah yeah so the

421
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,360
degree to which this advice is followed

422
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,700
obviously varies probably pretty widely

423
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,678
across different government agencies but

424
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,110
we know that at least some do monitor

425
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,390
events like USB drives being inserted

426
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,990
into controlled computers and we know

427
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:16,700
this from these our reality winners bail

428
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,799
hearing documents where they note that

429
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,690
she inserted a or this is the claim at

430
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,450
least that she inserted a thumb drive

431
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,730
into a top-secret computer for a certain

432
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,570
amount of time so this information is

433
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:34,280
really useful for a leak investigators

434
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,350
what else can the government do so

435
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,750
pretty classic tactics

436
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,139
compartmentalization disinformation so

437
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,870
compartmentalization is something that

438
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,270
we know is being done if you get a

439
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,949
document leaked as an org and that

440
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,010
document is only ever been in the hands

441
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,080
of five people and then it makes the job

442
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,990
of a leak investigator that much easier

443
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,730
and this information I don't know of

444
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,500
cases where that's been used to try to

445
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,210
detect the leaks at least in the US

446
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,110
government context but it certainly

447
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,720
might be a useful strategy so the reason

448
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,090
that I am bringing all of this up is we

449
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
should be thinking as a community that

450
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,918
wants to create a safe environment for

451
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,020
people to become sources and get

452
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,240
information out from these very control

453
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,770
of institutions how can we mitigate

454
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,190
these concerns is there anything that we

455
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,590
can do to mitigate these concerns this

456
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,179
part of the pipeline is not something

457
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,040
that the secure drop project is

458
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,549
addressing so I encourage you all to

459
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,010
think about that it's worth noting that

460
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,980
all of this is predicated on an insider

461
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,919
that is unable to circumvent whatever

462
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,350
controls are in place and these same

463
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,270
issues don't apply to an external actor

464
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,840
or a different set of constraints doom

465
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,730
just to know so let's return to some of

466
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,399
the challenges that secure drop is doing

467
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,980
something about and the first challenge

468
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,080
is the usability so creating a secure

469
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,710
system that has these multiple machines

470
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,010
usability is a big problem

471
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,300
so I'm now gonna go in more detail how

472
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:11,640
securedoc looks from the journalist

473
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:14,820
perspective yeah so this is what a

474
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,370
journalist looks at when they are using

475
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,929
secure draw they have two computers and

476
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,280
they usually have like arcade style

477
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,190
setup like this where they're next to

478
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,530
each other one is online that's the

479
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,810
machine on the left and one is a gap

480
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,830
that's the machine on the right and then

481
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:34,500
some transfer device is used to shuffle

482
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,840
thought remove docks from the journalist

483
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,840
workstation again online to the air-gap

484
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,379
workstation sometimes that's a USB Drive

485
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,570
those USB drives are reused sometimes

486
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,400
those are CDs depends on the

487
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,960
organization and their threat model so

488
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,210
when a journalist is downloading

489
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,890
documents they will use tails which is

490
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,410
the operating system that we use for

491
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,290
both of these devices which is based on

492
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,070
Debian and they will open up to a

493
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,000
browser they will go to the secure drop

494
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,879
journalist interface which looks like

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,670
this and they see a list of code names

496
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,190
these are all of the sources that have

497
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,980
submitted something to the instance from

498
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:20,970
there they download the documents they

499
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,640
open up their file manager and put in

500
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,760
their USB Drive mounted move those

501
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,100
documents over to the transfer device

502
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,980
then they'll physically shuttle a lot

503
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,860
over to the secure viewing station where

504
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,690
they will decrypt documents are really

505
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,090
the only thing that's in the secure

506
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,060
viewing station in terms of secure drop

507
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:45,300
tooling is just the private key

508
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,129
there was no UI there's no like secure

509
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,500
drop UI people are just clicking to

510
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,800
decrypt files and they use these do PG

511
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,090
pop-ups and the reason for this

512
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,220
complicated configuration is

513
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,639
it mean it mitigates a few threats but

514
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,090
the most important one is the threat of

515
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,520
malware so secured off is a system where

516
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,919
people are going to be opening random

517
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,050
files some of them can be malicious and

518
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:17,260
so we want to make sure that those files

519
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:19,120
are isolated so some of the usability

520
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,090
issues that we're finding with this flow

521
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,040
is we've made it really easy for sources

522
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,169
to leak documents but we've offloaded

523
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,190
some of that complexity onto journalists

524
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:32,920
on the back end so some things to

525
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,340
remember about this class of users is

526
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,830
that they're not technical they're they

527
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,629
don't want to use the command line they

528
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,189
have a lot of other stuff going on a lot

529
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,110
of other deadlines and their primary job

530
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,330
is not to be kind of fiddling around

531
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,709
with secure drop and doing all of this

532
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:55,139
air gap stuff and they're not spies so

533
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:57,490
we have to teach people OPSEC and other

534
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,410
the other parts that they need to know

535
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,670
in order to do this safely so that's one

536
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,370
of the things that freedom of the press

537
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,230
foundation does is we'll go in to news

538
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,389
organizations and train people to use

539
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,830
the system securely which is just a

540
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,020
matter of in this current configuration

541
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,629
building muscle memory and so there's a

542
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,160
team of people and each org that are in

543
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,140
charge of checking secure drop and

544
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,370
they'll be on a rotation and it's not

545
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,130
always like this but this is the most

546
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,250
common configuration and they'll just

547
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:28,110
get in the habit of everyday checking

548
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:33,250
going through this book this flow so

549
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,899
some of the issues are as follows so one

550
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,120
is that it's challenging to run custom

551
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,180
software just because there's an egg app

552
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,139
so if you want to install a program say

553
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:47,470
you get a bunch of emails leaked and you

554
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,480
want to open them in a nice format

555
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,730
that's going to be easy for you to work

556
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,220
with and search that's going to be

557
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,260
difficult you'll have to download that

558
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,300
software on the journalist workstation

559
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,490
and do this same flow to bring it across

560
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,470
to the air-gap machine so that's kind of

561
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,960
a difficult experience

562
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,030
updates can also be difficult for a

563
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,890
journalist user so if at any point

564
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,110
instructions to journalists and involve

565
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,380
like just make this boot drive that's

566
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:18,740
not really something but they can do

567
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,130
most for most of the time and it's also

568
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,090
the case that an air-gap machine may not

569
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,830
get updated so it's not going to get

570
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,750
automatic updates by construction

571
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,030
because it's air-gapped so that means

572
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,270
that as a function of time it's becoming

573
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:38,690
a softer and softer target as it's not

574
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,190
getting security updates so you know the

575
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,530
places in the secure of architecture

576
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,230
that need to be as hardened as possible

577
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,360
are obviously this place where we're

578
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,370
opening random malicious files the egg

579
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,310
app and the source interface which

580
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:57,469
anyone can access another usability heck

581
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,840
up is using the file manager for

582
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,860
organization like this so journalists

583
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,439
have this sometimes very chaotic way of

584
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,879
organizing files and folders keeping

585
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,560
track of all the sources they're talking

586
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,290
to in the air-gap environment because

587
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,820
there's no a tooling there and this

588
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,670
workflow is something that they're doing

589
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,840
every day so this can produce

590
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,200
corner-cutting

591
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,649
if you want to make it a little faster

592
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,970
for the most part I'm genuinely

593
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,010
impressed when I go into our

594
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,510
organization because journalists just

595
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,780
get into the habit of following the

596
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,650
steps and develop muscle memory despite

597
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,320
the fact that it's not the easiest

598
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:40,760
system to use but it's only natural that

599
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,810
sometimes corners get cut and then the

600
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,420
final concern which I'll talk a little

601
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,070
bit about in an extended way is just the

602
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,230
difficulty of removing metadata

603
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,840
different documents and that's an area

604
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,080
where there is just a lack of tooling

605
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,919
generally and it has pretty serious

606
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,399
implications so here are two examples

607
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,810
where at the top the New York Times

608
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,910
accidentally improperly redacted a PDF

609
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,889
and it was possible to read the name of

610
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,760
NSA agent which is obviously not their

611
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,120
intention and then

612
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,400
the bottom situation was where vice this

613
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,969
is pretty well known vice took pictures

614
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,140
of John McAfee when he was in hiding and

615
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,710
accidentally gave away his location

616
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,780
through access data in the photographs

617
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,280
so the tools that we have for

618
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,340
journalists right now are basically the

619
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,020
following and so one is the metadata

620
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,730
anonymization toolkit and this is

621
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,740
bundled in tales which is really nice

622
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,980
and it's a GUI tool which is also

623
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,419
something that journalists can use

624
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,160
unfortunately it's not getting a lot of

625
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,900
maintenance and development these days

626
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,820
so if anyone here is interested in

627
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,169
working on that I highly encourage you

628
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,840
to do so there is also a set of scripts

629
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:55,770
by Michael Lee called PDF Reducto so

630
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,928
that's also entails so that is really

631
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,540
helpful the only issue is that it's a

632
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:03,120
CLI so it's something that we can call

633
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,440
out to if we write a GUI but it's not

634
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
something that journalists can use

635
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,309
directly unless they're technical and

636
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,520
then the other technique that people use

637
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:15,418
to do this is printing documents using

638
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,340
an air-gap printer which is what like a

639
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,960
lot of FOIA offices will do for now

640
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,299
documents then we scan them to get rid

641
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
of metadata there are some really nice

642
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,179
examples of organizations handling this

643
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,940
well this is one case this is a secure

644
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,270
drop document also motherboard had a

645
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,110
story about a memo written by this guy

646
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,580
James d'amour at Google and the details

647
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,678
of the story don't really matter well

648
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,510
what is relevant is that they got the

649
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,980
same document multiple times from a

650
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,740
bunch of different sources which is

651
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,530
funny and of itself and the way they

652
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,540
handled the metadata and the document

653
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,309
was they just recreated the entire thing

654
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,260
that we typed it all and that's one of

655
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,928
the best methods for reducing risk to

656
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,169
sources when you want to publish the

657
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:03,000
entire document and so sometimes people

658
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,400
say oh well why didn't you just do it on

659
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,059
the server side get rid of the metadata

660
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,700
there and security concerns aside which

661
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,350
I can go into people are interested

662
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,179
that's useful metadata that journalists

663
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,490
want to use and so the kind of four

664
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,700
things that we one is we want to be able

665
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,070
to inspect it remove

666
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,080
Evette redacted parts of the documents

667
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,120
and then optionally retype it and if

668
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,110
that were done in an automated way that

669
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,239
would be awesome

670
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,370
so if you know of a problem that does

671
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,560
this really well in a user-friendly way

672
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,239
and please come talk to us if you want

673
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,649
to write this or working it all so let's

674
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,500
chat so how can we address some of these

675
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,890
challenges so one thing that we've been

676
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,860
working on is using cubes to replace

677
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,750
these two workstations the journalists

678
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,350
workstation unsecured viewing station

679
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,060
and combining those into a single device

680
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,639
so cubes for those of you that don't

681
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,260
know is a security focused operating

682
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,700
system where everything runs in a

683
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,370
virtual machine and uses the Xen

684
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,440
hypervisor to do so you have different

685
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,070
security domains which are different VMs

686
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,710
and I'll show a screenshot in a second

687
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,439
this is really well-suited for the

688
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,740
secure drop situation where the name of

689
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,710
the game is opening random files and you

690
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,210
don't want to hack the entire system if

691
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,460
you're interested in this generally I

692
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,610
recommend you to check out Michael Lee's

693
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,180
talk in a couple of hours in booth

694
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,500
wherever that is where where he'll go

695
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,580
through different demos of how you can

696
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:40,600
use this on your regular desktop so here

697
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:45,189
is a screenshot from using the current

698
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,500
secured architecture in cubes so each VM

699
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,050
has this colored a bar around it and

700
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,150
that denotes one security domain this

701
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:56,110
program is part of so these green beans

702
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:59,170
these are document leaks which are in

703
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,929
disposable vans so when this window is

704
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,520
closed the VM will be destroyed if the

705
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:07,210
document is potentially malicious it

706
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,540
only pops that one VM you can also have

707
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:14,050
VMs that are never connected to the

708
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,840
network so they the VM doesn't even see

709
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,180
a network adapter and so that's what the

710
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,600
yellow VM is which is storage VM so

711
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,060
that's something that we've prototype it

712
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,620
prototypes thanks to the work of Josh

713
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,850
there who's maybe in the audience

714
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,409
somewhere

715
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,629
and it really does seem like it's gonna

716
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,830
be a really promising Avenue for a

717
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,210
secure table so I'm going to talk about

718
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:40,040
that in a little bit more detail so the

719
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,740
way that this would work so on the Left

720
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm showing the current model where

721
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,180
we're using USB Drive and manual

722
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,639
intervention to move these documents

723
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,250
from one machine to another and again

724
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,220
manually decrypting documents and

725
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:58,520
instead we're planning to migrate to an

726
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,640
architecture like the following each so

727
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,710
that the gray box is one machine a

728
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,750
single workstation if you want to read

729
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,950
any of the code that's the or yeah the

730
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:16,700
get repo and each one of these white

731
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:19,700
boxes is a virtual machine so the only

732
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,740
VM that has direct network access is the

733
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,240
one that has the tall logo inside and

734
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:28,310
that's running the tour process the VM

735
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,770
underneath it that's responsible for

736
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,360
connecting to the van that has network

737
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,020
access inferring documents back and

738
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,080
forth what journalists see is a UI that

739
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,210
runs in a VM that is not connected it

740
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,310
doesn't have a network adapter and the

741
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,820
only way that can talk to the internet

742
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:50,030
is through its neighboring virtual

743
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,510
machine any document is open in a

744
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:55,820
disposable VM and then the private key

745
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,040
is kept separately from the environment

746
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,990
where documents are opened whereas right

747
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,610
now in the egg of environment that's the

748
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:06,470
same environment so that's the the plan

749
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,169
architecture and already we've been

750
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,510
using this internally for testing and

751
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,180
experience is really so much better for

752
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,740
journalists because you just go to tor

753
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,230
browser you click on the document and

754
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,970
then you just wait for a while as a

755
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:23,480
bunch of stuff happens that is not

756
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:27,530
exposed to the user and a document pops

757
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,360
open that's in a disposable VM so what

758
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,440
are the step returning to these

759
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,810
usability challenges how does this help

760
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,310
so it automates the submission process

761
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,290
the steps that are previously done

762
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:42,020
manually so it takes less time to text

763
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,760
check secure drop and we can auto update

764
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,590
everything so there's not one piece of

765
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,910
the architecture that's not going to be

766
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,250
getting security updates because it's

767
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,680
not connected to the network while

768
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,230
everything will update and journalists

769
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,150
can use a rich UI to interact with the

770
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,160
server which I'll talk about in a second

771
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,670
and there already are some tools and

772
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,170
cubes that do post processing of

773
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:07,790
documents that we can leverage in this

774
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:10,490
environment so the planned UI that will

775
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,690
replace the browser is going to look

776
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,940
something like this we're still debating

777
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,010
the final design but we want to move in

778
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,480
this direction which is a messaging like

779
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,550
interface which is something that's very

780
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,990
familiar it's like a familiar pattern to

781
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:26,389
most users on the Left we have different

782
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,160
sources that the journalist might be

783
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,660
communicating with other journalists

784
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,000
that are on border to secure drop that

785
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,790
you might want to talk about a security

786
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,160
up sources with and then on the right is

787
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:40,280
just a messaging like interface for

788
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,100
talking to sources a journalist logs in

789
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,930
they see this interface they send

790
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,899
messages to sources they can download

791
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:51,500
documents which are just inline in the

792
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:55,190
messaging flow so that's a very

793
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,440
promising Avenue for reducing the

794
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:01,100
frustration that some journalists are

795
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:06,920
having and really producing a still very

796
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:09,799
secure workflow but being a lot simpler

797
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,320
and enabling us to put in more tooling

798
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,760
as a function of time so that's what

799
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,379
we're currently working on and heading

800
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,850
towards and we're gearing for gearing up

801
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:23,418
for a next security audit which will be

802
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,190
later this year if you're from a news

803
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:28,668
organization and you think that this

804
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,470
would be fun to try out we're going to

805
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:32,779
be having a pilot and if this year early

806
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,850
next year with a few news organizations

807
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,429
for early user feedback and I strongly

808
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,500
encourage you to do so if you think this

809
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:43,110
is an interesting project I encourage

810
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,900
you to get involved so

811
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,060
in summary it's been an eventful couple

812
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,950
of years with a lot of major news

813
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,440
organizations in the u.s. now using

814
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:54,569
secure drop and a much more overseas

815
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,970
jury thanks to that localization effort

816
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,760
a lot of our energy is focused on

817
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:02,490
improving usability for journalists and

818
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,100
it's just the start of providing a rich

819
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,750
set of open source tools for the

820
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,610
journalists news case and in this

821
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,760
political climate is really important

822
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,680
for communities like ours to help

823
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,140
sources and journalists communicate

824
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,339
securely and do what they do best which

825
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:29,970
is speak truth to power

826
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:33,950
thanks for your attention thing we have

827
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:37,980
time for questions as I can't really see

828
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:40,500
so in the previous talk they were

829
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,680
talking about a new generation of Tor

830
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,940
onion services which have very long

831
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,690
addresses that seems like a major

832
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:52,560
usability problem for sources what's

833
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:56,070
your thinking around that it's yeah

834
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,140
certainly the case that there are some

835
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,170
usability issues associated with that

836
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:05,190
but overall it's much better for sources

837
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:08,120
to use version 3 onion services for the

838
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:11,520
most part it's not like sources are

839
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:15,390
memorizing secure drop source interface

840
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,580
URLs generally they're going to the news

841
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,160
organization's website their HTTPS

842
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,170
website and getting the only newer well

843
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,279
from there so it won't really change the

844
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:28,230
source workflow much but this model am i

845
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,790
right in thinking that there's still the

846
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,920
ideas that you still have one secure

847
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,720
machine in the counsel's office as you

848
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,340
suggested or is the idea that this is

849
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,270
something that could be distributed to

850
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,430
individual workstations good question so

851
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,650
the idea is that this would still be a

852
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,240
secure machine that's kept under lock

853
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,580
and key because there are other physical

854
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,430
and operational security concerns like

855
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,750
we wouldn't want journalists to be using

856
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,069
this like in a coffee shop whereas

857
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,350
we can just be watching what they're

858
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,570
doing or even just in the general

859
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:01,660
newsroom where it can be a pretty

860
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:04,720
uncontrolled environment so generally we

861
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,759
recommend a private room where

862
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,129
journalists can go maybe check out the

863
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,950
secure drop journalist workstation and

864
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:21,010
use it again and then it's kept under

865
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:24,189
lock and key otherwise thank you just a

866
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,740
minor concern about the cubes version

867
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:28,270
seems that in some ways that could be a

868
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,490
little less secure than the current

869
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,980
architecture like if you don't trust the

870
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,589
processor or Hardware you've got the

871
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,810
decrypted stuff and decrypted stuff

872
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,240
occurring appearing on screen in a

873
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,049
machine that has an internet connection

874
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,850
so are you planning to maintain the old

875
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:50,470
air-gapped version as well or dumb just

876
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:54,430
migrate everybody to the cubes minimum

877
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:58,330
we'll have to maintain tales workflow

878
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,669
for a while ideally we will migrate

879
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,319
everyone over what we do actually

880
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,920
depends on the results of this pilot

881
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,990
that I talked about when we see how

882
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,300
users react to using this in production

883
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:14,200
then we'll kind of make the final

884
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:17,380
determination about what to do but if

885
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,029
people like this workflow in terms of

886
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,760
the user experience and the plan is to

887
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,370
migrate everyone over there are some

888
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,340
additional threats it's absolutely true

889
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,980
from moving from an egg egg egg app

890
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,560
environment to the cubes environment but

891
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:36,220
there are other threats that we consider

892
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,310
more likely that are mitigated by moving

893
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,680
to that environment so you know there

894
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,020
are threats like as an vulnerabilities

895
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,120
that enable people to break out of the

896
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,460
VM where the documents are opened and

897
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,069
that's something that we'll never be

898
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,290
able to fully address but we can

899
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,000
mitigate it by doing things like making

900
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,700
sure that it's hard to get code

901
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,990
execution in that virtual machine and so

902
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,120
that's something that we're working on

903
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:04,649
now hardening the system to mitigate

904
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,650
those threats as much as we can

905
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,710
so especially with that new chat like

906
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,950
interface with the potential migration

907
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,289
to the cubes OS architecture do you see

908
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,359
like this new version of secure drop

909
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:20,640
potentially just replacing all other

910
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,200
alternative tools that a journalist

911
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,730
might use to communicate with sources

912
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,799
like I know that a lot of journalists

913
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,660
have like been using signal or they

914
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:31,109
might still be using like I don't know

915
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:33,359
like PGP encrypted emails do you just

916
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:34,970
see them using that like singular

917
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,058
interface for everything at that point

918
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:41,098
that's a good question I don't see it

919
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,950
replacing all of those channels I think

920
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:47,569
they'll all exist together and that is

921
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:49,558
because it still will take significant

922
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:51,359
technical effort from a news

923
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,490
organization or they need to get someone

924
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,710
that's able to like install a service to

925
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,029
do so

926
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:59,520
whereas to set up like a signal tip line

927
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:01,950
it's pretty easy to set up secure drop

928
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,230
you need like someone who's a Linux

929
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:09,020
admin so until that's not the case no I

930
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:14,599
wanted to ask a question about a

931
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:18,049
essentially likes reactions to do this

932
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,079
it seems to me like the the natural

933
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:23,670
counterpoint to to this is to like do

934
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:26,400
versioning of all documents like to each

935
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,500
individual party so that if a version

936
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,020
leaks that there's some sort of hidden

937
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,970
metadata inside I thought it was great

938
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,700
how you talked about you know retyping

939
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:39,419
retyping this stuff I wonder like what

940
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,910
from the user experience from a leaker

941
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,950
secure drop can do to kind of inform

942
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,509
them of those kind of threats and form

943
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:49,618
the journalists I know that like that's

944
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:52,710
been an issue before yeah so that kind

945
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,829
of tactic where slight differences will

946
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,539
be introduced in a document to make it

947
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,069
clear when the document was leaked and

948
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,430
that timing information is extremely

949
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:03,990
useful for a leak investigator and the

950
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,569
best thing that the security project can

951
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,220
do at this stage is let journalists know

952
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:10,079
that this is a threat on and I think

953
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,490
most of the big news organizations are

954
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,140
aware of this if they're working with

955
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,328
leaked documents and so the way that

956
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,040
that kind of information can be injected

957
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:21,370
like watermarking as slight changes in

958
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,730
fonts typos that stuff that you can take

959
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:27,009
out by retyping documents in terms of

960
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,450
slight changing in wording that's

961
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,640
something that would not be addressed by

962
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,799
retyping documents and that may be a

963
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,259
threat that might just need to be

964
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,330
accepted it can't be fully mitigated but

965
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,650
risk can be reduced significantly by

966
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:43,270
retyping the document what you see is

967
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,660
the pros and cons of using secure drop

968
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:51,240
over just like using signal and sending

969
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:53,759
an attachment to a journalist mm-hmm so

970
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,189
when you're using secure drop those

971
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,810
documents are a being sent through a

972
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:02,380
system where there isn't a metadata

973
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:04,779
trail like if you because everything is

974
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,750
going through talk and the documents are

975
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,240
sitting on a server that is hardened and

976
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,160
opened in an environment that is

977
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,339
hardened so the overall security level

978
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,720
across the architecture is much higher

979
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:25,480
than just you know using signal on a

980
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:26,480
phone the third question cool thanks

981
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,539
very much

982
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,539
[Applause]
