1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,830
it's team and today I'm gonna talk a bit

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,559
about what's been happening to our human

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,320
rights online what we can do about it

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,270
and how ranking Digital Rights fits in

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,119
to that ecosystem of advocacy so ranking

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,970
digital rights is a non-profit research

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,580
initiative we work with an international

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,189
network of partners to set global

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,750
standards for how companies in the

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,690
information and communications

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,739
technology sector should respect freedom

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,379
of expression and privacy we also then

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,870
rank 22 of the world's most powerful

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,269
internet mobile and telecommunication

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,690
companies on how transparent they are

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,230
about their policies that affect users

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,050
rates so as you can see on the slide

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,819
this is a map of the of the 22 companies

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,919
that we ranked in our most recent index

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,600
which we released in April of this year

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,200
so first let's talk about what's going

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,030
on with our human rights online this is

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,310
a screenshot of the congressional

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,729
testimony with Mark Zuckerberg we came

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,780
to testify in front of Congress about

26
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,250
what had happened with the Cambridge

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,049
analytical scandal this past spring so

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,720
we've all seen the news right over the

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,600
past year too there's been increasingly

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,860
bad news about when it comes to our

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,750
rights to privacy and freedom of

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,100
expression online this is one of the

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,710
most recent examples where the CEO of

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,649
Facebook was called before Congress to

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,809
talk about how his company had

36
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,259
mishandled the vast amounts of user

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,270
information that it collects about us

38
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,460
which had allowed the data of 87 million

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,130
Facebook users to leak to Cambridge

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,979
analytic and be used for political

41
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:04,679
targeting during several elections we've

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,860
also seen disruption of elections in

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,520
other ways so according to freedom on

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,569
the Nets 2017 report online manipulation

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,700
and disinformation tactics how to roll

46
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:20,108
in elections in at least 18 countries

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,170
from 2016 to 2017 so you can see in the

48
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:24,639
slide they measured the prevalence of

49
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,920
these tactics in different countries

50
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,379
included in their report things like

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,500
pro-government media or a paid online

52
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:35,048
and commentators the use of political

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,750
bots and then also dissemination of fake

54
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:40,150
news around elections this is something

55
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:44,109
that we're seeing increase over the past

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,959
few years and then of course the data

57
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:50,049
breaches 2017 was a huge year for data

58
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,769
breaches we learned in the case of Yahoo

59
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:56,469
that all three billion yahoo accounts

60
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:59,439
had been affected by the data breach at

61
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:02,290
that company we've also seen data

62
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,599
breaches from Equifax from uber from

63
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,030
other companies so this is increasingly

64
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,260
a problem for the health and the

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,599
security of the Internet and then lastly

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,149
we've we've also seen censorship of

67
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,099
human rights related content so there's

68
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,209
been a number of articles about making

69
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,388
headlines about human rights activists

70
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,859
and others documenting evidence of

71
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,079
crimes against humanity and other human

72
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,090
rights abuses and then that content

73
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:34,239
disappearing from platforms like YouTube

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,389
where it might be gone forever and won't

75
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,530
be able to be used in criminal cases or

76
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,849
advocacy campaigns another important

77
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,359
means of addressing the human rights

78
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,939
abuses in these conflicts so those are

79
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,799
just a small sample of issues that were

80
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,448
seen making headlines over the past few

81
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,689
years there are there are many more

82
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:58,449
other issues going on that could take up

83
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,828
a whole talk but these are kind of some

84
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,509
of the the big headlines that we've all

85
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,930
seen and what these all have in common

86
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:07,869
is that in each case the decisions that

87
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,219
companies make have an impact on how

88
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,379
users are able to exercise their rights

89
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,539
so at this point in time given both the

90
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,909
increasing power of global tech and

91
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:21,488
telecommunication companies and the

92
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:23,469
numerous documented cases in which these

93
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:26,409
companies are infringing on users rights

94
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:28,900
the question we have is how do we create

95
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,160
an online environment where human rights

96
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,780
are actually protected so I'm going to

97
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,970
talk a little bit about ranking digital

98
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,469
rights and kind of how what our theory

99
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,110
of changes when it comes to this

100
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,900
question we take a particular approach

101
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,150
to this so as I mentioned earlier we

102
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,219
evaluate 22 of the world's most powerful

103
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,190
Internet until communication companies

104
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,740
on how transparent they are about their

105
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,700
policies and their practices that affect

106
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,970
users rights so you can see here here's

107
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,789
a map of the top social networks in each

108
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,600
country as of January 2018 so all the

109
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:10,750
blue countries are where Facebook is the

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,140
top social network that people access on

111
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,510
a regular basis in Russia you can see

112
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,340
the kind of tan color is for V contacts

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,580
they're sort of some people call it a

114
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,940
facebook like equivalent in Russia key

115
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,859
Zone in China and then others around the

116
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,770
world but you can see that that Facebook

117
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,070
kind of dominates a lot of the map here

118
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,680
and then similarly top web sites that

119
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,460
are accessed across the world the light

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,330
blue is all Google and then we have in

121
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,000
the light orange color is Baidu

122
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,700
VK again at the top and then YouTube in

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,630
some of the the greyish pink countries

124
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,950
you can see um so we we look at the 22

125
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,440
companies that have kind of the biggest

126
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,500
footprint globally that's how we

127
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:07,240
determined which companies to include in

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:10,090
our index and so we evaluate these

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,010
companies by creating a methodology

130
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,369
which is essentially a set of 35

131
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,409
benchmarks and we research how well

132
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,770
companies public disclosures meet these

133
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,440
benchmarks our research goes through

134
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,570
seven steps of review and verification

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,910
including a step where we share our

136
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,290
preliminary findings with the companies

137
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:34,840
themselves so they have an opportunity

138
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,760
to respond to what we found and ask

139
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,919
clarification questions about what it is

140
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,740
that we're measuring and then we then

141
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,710
publish and

142
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,200
index with top-level findings and we

143
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:49,849
release a public data set which has all

144
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,380
the data that went into the rankings so

145
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,270
what are these standards come from we

146
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,850
created this methodology it has a set of

147
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:00,109
benchmarks what's what's the basis for

148
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,500
for our methodology so one of the the

149
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:06,140
founding frameworks for our project is

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,570
the United Nations guiding principles on

151
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,150
business and human rights these are a

152
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,370
set of 31 principles that were adopted

153
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:17,030
by the United Nations Human Rights

154
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,740
Council in 2011 and they affirm that

155
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,289
just as governments have a duty to

156
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,780
protect human rights companies also have

157
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,770
a responsibility to respect human rights

158
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,299
so these principles include things like

159
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,979
companies should avoid causing or

160
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,530
contributing to adverse Human Rights

161
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,150
impacts they should seek to prevent or

162
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,309
mitigate these adverse Human Rights

163
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,469
impacts they should make policy

164
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,500
commitments conduct human rights impact

165
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,720
assessments and also provide access to

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,460
remedy in cases where human rights have

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
been infringed upon because of the

168
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,810
company's actions we also take a cue

169
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,669
from the global network initiative

170
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,920
global principles on freedom of

171
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,390
expression and privacy these are

172
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,240
commitments that were developed by

173
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,610
companies investors academia and civil

174
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,420
society which really focused on getting

175
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,820
companies to consider and avoid the

176
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,460
adverse impacts of government demands

177
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,760
and government regulation on their users

178
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,039
rights companies who are members of the

179
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,810
gni commit to implement these principles

180
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,330
and they go through a regular review

181
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,870
process so ranking digital rights

182
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,840
methodology builds on these frameworks

183
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,240
and also on several years of stakeholder

184
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,810
engagement and drafting with a range of

185
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,630
different organizations companies

186
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,900
academics and others who who influenced

187
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,809
our work and came to a consensus on what

188
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,939
the sort of baseline things companies

189
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,839
should be doing to demonstrate their

190
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,390
respect for users rights so our index

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,089
measures how transparent companies are

192
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,339
we're just asking companies to disclose

193
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:59,300
what they do what their policies are

194
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:01,910
what their commitments are it's to be

195
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,008
honest it's a pretty low bar it's not

196
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,209
covering everything that companies

197
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,370
should be doing in order to be

198
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,859
respectful of human rights but the idea

199
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,569
is this is kind of the baseline of what

200
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,750
companies who care about human rights

201
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:17,569
can do to demonstrate their commitments

202
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,569
and there are also other important

203
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:23,209
conversations to be had about these

204
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,729
companies business models whether these

205
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:27,378
practices and policies are sustainable

206
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,500
or compatible with a human rights

207
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:32,600
focused online ecosystem those are also

208
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,970
important conversations but we're

209
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,550
focused on the transparency part as a

210
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,810
first step in that conversation to get

211
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,579
companies to talk about what it is

212
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,800
they're actually doing so what does the

213
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:48,469
ranking to droids Index tell us these

214
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,050
are our findings from the 2018 index

215
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:55,759
which we released in April so you can

216
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,930
see we rank on the top as the Internet

217
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,300
companies on the bottom as the

218
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,250
telecommunication companies and it has

219
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,199
their total scores as well as the

220
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,639
breakdown of their scores for the three

221
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:08,149
different categories in our methodology

222
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,639
these categories are governance freedom

223
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,709
of expression and privacy so in each one

224
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,750
of those categories there's a subset of

225
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,670
benchmarks that have indicators and

226
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,649
element questions that lay out what

227
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,500
companies should be disclosing about

228
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,759
their practices

229
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,529
so a couple of things I want to point

230
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:29,269
out about the findings you'll see for

231
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:31,579
example Google Microsoft and both ranked

232
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,790
top three overall this doesn't

233
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:38,420
necessarily mean that they're the best

234
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:40,309
companies or that these are the

235
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,819
companies that I would point to if

236
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:45,439
someone was asking if let's say a human

237
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:47,180
rights advocate and odds are by Jean

238
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,219
said you know which companies should I

239
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,609
use this isn't necessarily like a

240
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,170
foolproof indicator of that it's an

241
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,629
indicator of how transparent these

242
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,670
companies are so the top three companies

243
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:01,420
are the ones that are disclosing the

244
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,259
most information about the most things

245
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,479
since that's what we measure we measure

246
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:09,709
transparency

247
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,060
and the results show that there's still

248
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,589
gaps in disclosure for all of these

249
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,410
companies so some of these companies do

250
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:18,019
particularly well in some areas and fall

251
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,709
short and others and you'll notice the

252
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,690
scores in the left-hand column indicate

253
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:28,279
that only two companies Google and

254
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:30,500
Microsoft got a D if we were looking at

255
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,240
this from an academic lens but the rest

256
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,820
of the companies got F's so no one's

257
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,399
doing great and there's definitely a

258
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,930
room for improvement for everyone but

259
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,329
it's a tool it's a tool to push

260
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,910
companies to be better to disclose more

261
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:51,279
and the methodology gives a roadmap for

262
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:55,130
companies to do that this year we also

263
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,589
publish data on year-on-year trends so

264
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,800
we kept the methodology consistent from

265
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:03,550
the 2017 index to the 2018 index which

266
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,290
allowed us to show where companies are

267
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:10,310
either improving or declining in their

268
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,079
disclosure and our findings this year

269
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,660
showed that almost all the companies had

270
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,829
at least some improvement and you can

271
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,980
see in the graph Apple for example had

272
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:23,689
the highest improvement year-on-year

273
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,420
they improved their disclosure of their

274
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,180
governance policies they also improved

275
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,800
in several areas where they disclosed

276
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,899
information about their policies or

277
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,029
their practices that they were already

278
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:37,279
doing or they already had in place they

279
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,779
just hadn't focused on disclosing that

280
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,160
information to the public to their

281
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:45,380
stakeholders so we we saw a relatively

282
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,199
large improvement from Apple this year

283
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,360
in those areas Twitter also had

284
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,149
improvement in several areas around

285
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,430
their human rights impact assessments as

286
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:02,000
well as how they respond to third-party

287
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,760
requests like government requests to

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,660
remove content or restrict accounts on

289
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,019
their platform the telecommunications

290
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,600
company telefónica improved their

291
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,850
transparency reporting which for those

292
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,889
who aren't familiar a lot of companies

293
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,959
now are adopting this practice where

294
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,119
release transparency reports that

295
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,819
include information about their process

296
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:29,569
either for responding to takedown

297
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:31,969
requests removal requests or requests to

298
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:33,529
hand over a user information for the

299
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,019
telecommunication companies and

300
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,910
telefónica in particular they disclosed

301
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,970
more information about how they respond

302
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,829
to network shutdown requests from

303
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,339
governments and I'll go a bit more into

304
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:48,979
that in a few minutes um and then so

305
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,139
I've also highlighted you'll see the the

306
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,669
three arrows that point to the

307
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,649
telecommunication companies that joined

308
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:57,799
the global network initiative in the

309
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:00,889
past year or it was March of 2017

310
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:04,669
so telefónica Vodafone and Orange all

311
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,290
joined the gni in the past year so we

312
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:08,660
saw improvements from all three of those

313
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,209
companies where they made meaningful

314
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,600
changes to their disclosed policies and

315
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,399
commitments as part of their their

316
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,649
joining the global network initiative

317
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,819
and then the last thing I wanted to

318
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,819
highlight for the year-on-year

319
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:26,660
comparison is the Chinese companies so I

320
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:28,849
circled Baidu and Tencent which both had

321
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,149
improvements in their disclosure from

322
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:37,009
the previous year mostly in the area of

323
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:39,679
how they handle user information so in

324
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,739
the area of their privacy policies what

325
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,988
information they collection and retain

326
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:46,970
those kind of practices so it shows that

327
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:49,069
even in some of the more restrictive

328
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,169
political environments all of the

329
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:52,819
companies in our ranking still have

330
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:57,439
areas where they can improve their

331
00:14:52,819 --> 00:15:01,819
disclosure another one of the areas

332
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:05,829
where we've seen improvements from the

333
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:09,169
2017 index to the 2018 index is

334
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:11,508
company's role in policing content or

335
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:14,089
accounts on their own platforms so this

336
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,509
graph shows a number of indicators or

337
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,739
benchmarks in our index that measures

338
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:21,649
companies disclosure of their policies

339
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:23,689
for policing content so includes the

340
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:25,549
first two which have to do with their

341
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:29,660
own Terms of Service enforcement and

342
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:31,880
then the others have to do with their

343
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,130
responses to government requests or

344
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,720
third party requests to remove content

345
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,939
or restrict accounts on their platforms

346
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,220
so we're seeing slight improvements

347
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,280
across the board in this area but again

348
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:47,540
there's a lot there's still relatively

349
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:51,740
low scores across the board we have seen

350
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,990
more improvements on indicator f5 which

351
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,900
is specifically about the process for

352
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,790
responding to third-party requests we've

353
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,699
seen less improvement from companies

354
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,490
around their process for enforcing their

355
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,320
own rules this is something that the

356
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,090
broader civil society community has been

357
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,450
pushing companies to be more transparent

358
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,300
about for several years and we're seeing

359
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:18,170
slowly slowly better disclosure in that

360
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,709
area but only from certain companies who

361
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,969
are I think getting pressure the most

362
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,550
and then finally one area I wanted to

363
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,740
point out was our indicator F 4 which is

364
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,900
data about Terms of Service enforcement

365
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,490
this is an indicator that has really

366
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,260
lagged over the past few years and is

367
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,620
still lagging you can see it's the

368
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,340
lowest bar in this chart but we are

369
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,230
starting to see steps toward improvement

370
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,840
in this area and again this really has

371
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,820
to do with a collaborative effort from a

372
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,010
number of organizations and individuals

373
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,280
who have been working on this issue to

374
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,930
get companies to disclose actual data

375
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,670
about their actions that they take to

376
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:00,530
enforce their own rules on their

377
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:03,800
platform so well I'll go back for a

378
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,260
second so disclosure on f4 has been very

379
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,669
low for the past few years the slight

380
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,040
increases that we've seen have mostly

381
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,189
been anecdotal so companies will publish

382
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,310
like a blog post saying in these few

383
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,650
months we removed over a million

384
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,359
accounts for like extremist activity or

385
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,189
something like that but not

386
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:26,780
comprehensive data by any means

387
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:29,270
so just in April we started to see a few

388
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:33,260
companies make big strides in this area

389
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,030
this was after our data was we stopped

390
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,100
our research cycle so this will be taken

391
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,399
into account in the next research cycle

392
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,020
but we saw Google released a report for

393
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,410
YouTube where

394
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:50,240
they broke down data for that provides

395
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,330
much more information about how much

396
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,190
content they're removing by what method

397
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,570
they're removing this content how it's

398
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,430
being flagged or how it's coming to

399
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,320
their attention and then for what

400
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,140
reasons so what type of content is being

401
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,810
removed so we saw this from YouTube and

402
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,360
then I think a week later Facebook also

403
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,300
released a report of a similar nature

404
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,429
talking about giving data about how they

405
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,470
enforce their Community Guidelines and

406
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,900
their Terms of Service so those will be

407
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,000
taken into account in the next cycle of

408
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,100
our research we're really excited to see

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,870
companies start to disclose this kind of

410
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,000
information in a similar way that they

411
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,310
disclose information about government

412
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,140
requests to remove data we also need to

413
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:33,669
know what they're doing how they're

414
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,650
policing content on their own platforms

415
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,150
so we've seen some improvements but

416
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,550
there are also significant gaps in

417
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,210
disclosure and these gaps can sometimes

418
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:48,530
serve as warning signs or areas to focus

419
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:51,830
our advocacy so one area that I'd like

420
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:54,590
to point out is all right what we call

421
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,169
our user information questions so these

422
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,570
are a set of seven privacy indicators

423
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,490
that measure how transparent companies

424
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,919
are about how they handle your user

425
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,110
information so things like what the user

426
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,880
information do they collect what user

427
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,649
information do they share who are they

428
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,660
sharing it with how long are they

429
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,970
retaining this information do you have

430
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,500
any control over what they're collecting

431
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,520
what they're doing with your user

432
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,830
information so on these set of questions

433
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,470
we've seen despite some improvements

434
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,810
from a few companies the average scores

435
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,900
are still quite low the highest score is

436
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,000
56 out of 100 and this is a really

437
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,430
important issue for a lot of us it's

438
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,760
also very much related to the Cambridge

439
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,490
analytic a scandal and you'll see that

440
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,129
Facebook's disclosure in this area is

441
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,700
worse than many and many of the

442
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,080
indicators compared to other companies

443
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,330
but no one is doing particularly well

444
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,850
here so Facebook kind of came under the

445
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,770
fire for good reason but it's also a

446
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,459
broader trend that we should be

447
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,470
concerned about

448
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,510
how little these companies are

449
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,750
disclosing about how they handle our

450
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,429
user information people don't really

451
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,409
know what what companies are doing with

452
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:08,330
our user information and that's because

453
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:10,929
companies aren't clear about it they are

454
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,789
not really disclosing their practices

455
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,980
very clearly but we're anticipating

456
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:19,879
seeing some movement on these indicators

457
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,010
over the next year with the GDP are in

458
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,590
Europe and how companies decide to

459
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,640
comply with that regulation we might see

460
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,279
some movement on some of these

461
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:33,649
indicators hopefully in a positive

462
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:37,909
direction another area that we measure

463
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:40,070
in our index is security oversight so

464
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:42,230
this includes what companies are

465
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,500
disclosing about their practices to keep

466
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,450
user data secure things like do they

467
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,250
have systems in place to limit and

468
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,770
monitor employee access to user

469
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,330
information do they disclose that

470
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,490
they're conducting internal security

471
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,970
audits do they disclose that they're

472
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,590
conducting external security audits and

473
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,929
as we can see again there are a few

474
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,470
companies who are disclosing enough

475
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,929
information here Google and Kakao from

476
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,360
the Internet companies and then AT&T as

477
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:14,049
well but again the scores across the

478
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,850
border are relatively low and this also

479
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:19,129
relates closely to another indicator in

480
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,289
our index which is about policies for

481
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,679
responding to data breaches as we know

482
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,789
this is a big issue for the security of

483
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,510
the internet for the security of our

484
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:31,879
user information so we want companies to

485
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,370
disclose you know in the event that you

486
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,299
don't properly secure user information

487
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:39,830
or a data breach occurs what steps are

488
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,730
you going to take to remedy the

489
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:46,879
situation so we ask that companies

490
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,370
disclose that they will notify the

491
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,490
relevant authorities

492
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,049
that's all notify affected users and we

493
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,690
want them to disclose what steps they'll

494
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:59,450
take to address the impact of the data

495
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,490
breach on their users so two of the

496
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,799
first two things are in many

497
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,929
jurisdictions already required by law

498
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,450
these are things that companies usually

499
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,049
have to do anyways but we're asking they

500
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,220
just glow

501
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:16,759
of public commitments to do this and

502
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:19,869
also to make clear to users what they'll

503
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,730
do about the adverse impacts that might

504
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,738
affect users because of these data

505
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,940
breaches so we've seen very few

506
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:30,739
companies disclosing these commitments

507
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,799
even though in it's a pretty low bar for

508
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,779
for companies to disclose that they will

509
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,749
do what is legally required and then

510
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:40,730
also what steps they'll take to remedy

511
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:42,830
the situation so this is an area that

512
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,090
we've been watching to try and push

513
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:50,259
companies to be more transparent and and

514
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:54,199
get them to improve their policies and

515
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:57,679
then finally we have an indicator on

516
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,080
Network shutdowns which pertains to the

517
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:05,119
telecommunication companies that we rank

518
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,460
in the index from a number of civil

519
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,668
society organizations have been doing

520
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,889
research on this issue over the past few

521
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,840
years access and now in particular has

522
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,729
been documenting the prevalence of

523
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,470
network shutdown requests or demands

524
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:23,119
around the world and the the number of

525
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,090
the instances of network shutdown

526
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,199
requests are increasing and

527
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,488
telecommunication companies play a key

528
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,239
role in these events so we understand

529
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:36,619
that oftentimes companies are

530
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:38,629
constrained in how they can respond to

531
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:41,928
these kinds of demands but we want them

532
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:43,908
to have clear policies in place for what

533
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,710
their process looks like for responding

534
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,629
to these requests and we want them to

535
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,309
disclose that information so their users

536
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:53,719
have that information as well um and

537
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:56,330
again this is an area where we have seen

538
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,730
some improvements in disclosure over the

539
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,730
past year you can see this is a

540
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:06,019
year-on-year comparison between the 2017

541
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:08,600
scores and the 2018 scores however

542
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:10,279
disclosure across the board remains low

543
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:16,248
no company

544
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:19,749
scores over 50% on this indicator so

545
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:22,640
what does all this data tell us and how

546
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,590
does it help us kind of move toward

547
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,970
holding companies accountable for their

548
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,409
impact on human rights online one of the

549
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,330
things that this data tells us is it

550
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,290
helps us understand kind of what the

551
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,120
problems are

552
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,700
and what the gaps where there are gaps

553
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,040
in disclosure and then hold companies

554
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,530
accountable for how their actions and

555
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,510
their stated human rights commitments

556
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,420
compared to their disclosed policies so

557
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:50,140
an example of this that comes up a lot

558
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,400
is the Terms of Service enforcement

559
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,070
indicators so we want companies to be

560
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,660
transparent about what their rules are

561
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,700
either in their Terms of Service or

562
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,510
their community guidelines and how they

563
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,490
enforce their those rules that isn't

564
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,260
enough to ensure that they are that

565
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,970
their policies are sound that they're

566
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,440
enforcing them in a consistent way as

567
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,440
we've all seen with some of these

568
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,540
companies it's often very incoherent set

569
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,810
of policies in terms of how they're

570
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,060
stated or how they're implemented but

571
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,040
without knowing without forcing

572
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,679
companies to disclose what the policies

573
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,000
are there's no way for us to engage with

574
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,360
those companies to improve their

575
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,730
policies or to have a sense of how their

576
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,820
internal policies align with how they're

577
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:38,240
actually implementing their enforcement

578
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,429
in practice so transparency can help us

579
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,260
have a better conversation have better

580
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:46,700
advocacy campaigns more targeted

581
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:49,430
advocacy campaigns it's not a fix in and

582
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,770
of itself but it can increase trust

583
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,430
between users and companies and help

584
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,610
kind of build that bridge that

585
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,590
relationship

586
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,330
it also gives stakeholders information

587
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,580
they need to push companies to improve

588
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,710
their practices and it gives it provides

589
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,899
data to show where companies are failing

590
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,150
to disclose important information it

591
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,810
also shows where where there's room for

592
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,880
improvement

593
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,919
especially when we look at companies in

594
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,870
similar jurisdictions if one company is

595
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,090
outperforming the other it's clear that

596
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,070
there aren't legal restrictions

597
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,959
preventing that company from disclosing

598
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,179
information because other companies in

599
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,740
that jurisdiction are able to disclose

600
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:29,930
that information as well so what can you

601
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,330
do with this information if you are

602
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,430
interested in using it there's a lot of

603
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,409
things that you can do we put our

604
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,600
methodology online

605
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:42,230
so it can be used as a framework for

606
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,789
asking companies questions if you're an

607
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,320
investor there's information on our

608
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:47,929
website for how to use the index

609
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,120
findings including an investor brief so

610
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:52,340
I put an excerpt from our investor brief

611
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,668
up there with key questions that

612
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,370
investors can ask companies in order to

613
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,330
push companies to have adopted better

614
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,489
policies that are more respectful of

615
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,320
human rights and also ask them if they

616
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,799
don't have those policies why don't they

617
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,539
have them there's also a lot of

618
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,070
resources on our website that I wanted

619
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:13,879
to highlight so if you go to ranking

620
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,668
Digital Rights org backslash Index 2018

621
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,340
you can find the breakdown of all of our

622
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,650
rankings for the past year there's also

623
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,480
a lot of resources in here so if you if

624
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,630
you go up to the resources tab that's

625
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,780
where you'll find the investor brief on

626
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,940
the the second bar at the top you can

627
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,260
click on either companies or services

628
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,120
and that will give you a much more

629
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,340
detailed breakdown of how these

630
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,199
companies perform on all 35 indicators

631
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,840
you can also see how they compare with

632
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,000
with other companies and you can look at

633
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,039
the different individual services so for

634
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,620
each company that we rank we give them

635
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,820
an overall score but for each of those

636
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,309
companies there are a number of services

637
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,439
that we evaluate that make up that score

638
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:00,080
so for Facebook for example we look at

639
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,320
Facebook the social network platform we

640
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:13,250
look at whatsapp Facebook Messenger and

641
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:14,658
Instagram okay oh and then the last

642
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,450
thing I wanted to point out is the

643
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:19,400
download button up there is where all

644
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,309
our data lives so if you are a person

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,720
play around with it there's a lot of

653
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,539
different ways that you can work with

654
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,900
the data to find interesting comparisons

655
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:47,000
between companies you can also highlight

656
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,510
issues that are important to you by

657
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,620
digging through the indicators

658
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,090
and so if you're interested in doing

659
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,669
that I mean feel free to do it but we'd

660
00:28:52,090 --> 00:29:00,070
also love to hear about it if you decide

661
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:01,420
to do some of that digging around sorry

662
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm having a hard time now reading my

663
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:10,270
notes cuz the ladies changing Oh

664
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:12,189
and then finally adaptations of our

665
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,860
methodologies so as I mentioned our

666
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,590
methodology is all available online

667
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,169
we can't rank and evaluate all the

668
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:23,080
companies in the world because we only

669
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:25,510
there's like six of us on staff so we

670
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,000
can only do so many things but we

671
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:31,050
encourage others to take the methodology

672
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,640
and adapt it to local or regional

673
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,780
research projects there has been we've

674
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,450
worked with a couple different groups

675
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,320
already who have taken our methodology

676
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,530
and applied it to rank either companies

677
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,360
that we don't rank or ones in a specific

678
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:49,030
region so I worked with some folks in

679
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,429
New York to look at the different

680
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,490
Internet service provider options for

681
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,330
residents of New York and how

682
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,610
transparent they are about their privacy

683
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,780
policies so if you live in New York you

684
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,929
could definitely check that out it's an

685
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,210
interesting report but we're open to

686
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,440
working with other research

687
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,050
organizations to do these kind of

688
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,850
adaptations in order to get the research

689
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:14,320
out into the world and provide more

690
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:17,469
opportunities for advocacy so kind of

691
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,090
too close where do we go from here

692
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,950
I think there are a lot of lessons that

693
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,139
we can learn from the environmental

694
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,270
movement other talks have also mentioned

695
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,550
this and it's something that we we

696
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:31,000
reference when talking about our

697
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,129
methodology there have been successful

698
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,130
examples of pushing companies to do the

699
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,990
right thing over years and decades of

700
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,890
advocacy and things like public pressure

701
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,810
things like positive well written

702
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,470
regulation things like divestment

703
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:50,889
campaigns we've already seen several

704
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:53,440
investor groups taking a stand against

705
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,590
some company practices over the past few

706
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,570
months so there there's a lot that we

707
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,000
can do and this is just one part of the

708
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,950
equation of the efforts needed in order

709
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,739
to hold companies accountable

710
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,049
and push for greater transparency so I

711
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,940
think in closing and we need to continue

712
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,580
to think about you know what kind of

713
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,239
future do we want from the online

714
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:20,939
ecosystem and how do we push for that

715
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:20,940
better future so thank you everyone and

716
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,928
I think we have a little bit of time for

717
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,359
questions so if anyone has questions can

718
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,359
go up to the mic in the middle

719
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:16,080
no show I just wanted to ask about the

720
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,730
indicators you mentioned governance I'm

721
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,860
wondering if you could say more about

722
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,720
what specifically you're looking at sure

723
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,550
absolutely thank you so the question was

724
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,010
about our governance indicators and and

725
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,040
talking a bit more about what we include

726
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:32,940
and what we measure so the governance

727
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:35,520
indicators measure the company as at the

728
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,750
group level so what policies they

729
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,040
disclose about the the commitments they

730
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,840
make to human rights and how they

731
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,820
implement those commitments throughout

732
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,980
the company as a whole um so there are

733
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,649
six indicators in that category we

734
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,450
measure the first indicator is does the

735
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,340
company make a commitment to respect

736
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,730
freedom of expression and privacy as

737
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:59,189
human rights and we specifically look

738
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,850
for language referencing human rights

739
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,160
frameworks

740
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,860
um because some companies will talk

741
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,440
about protecting user information and

742
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:13,429
things like that but not privacy as a

743
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:15,480
human right we look at whether there is

744
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,820
commitments from different levels within

745
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,620
the company to oversee the

746
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,740
implementation of these commitments to

747
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,070
human rights so we look at board level

748
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:27,090
executive level and management level

749
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,800
commitments to oversee the

750
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,590
implementation of these human rights

751
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,960
policies we look at human rights impact

752
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,689
assessments so we ask that companies

753
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,630
disclose that they conduct regular human

754
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,490
rights impact assessments to anticipate

755
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,220
whether there might be human rights

756
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:47,150
concerns arising from the rollout of a

757
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,190
new service or entering a new market

758
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,360
things like that and how they're the

759
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,450
services they already have might be

760
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:59,370
infringing on user rights and then we

761
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,590
also look at access to remedy so which

762
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,229
is which comes from the UN guiding

763
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,540
principles on Human Rights does the

764
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,690
company disclose some kind of Avenue for

765
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,429
users to approach the company contact

766
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,560
the company if they feel their rights

767
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,720
have been infringed upon so those are

768
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,310
those are roughly the indicators that

769
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,310
make up the governance section

770
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:26,399
any other questions

771
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:28,699
Oh the mic is back on if you want to use

772
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,699

773
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,659
see anyone getting up so if there are no

774
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:43,379
more questions you'll feel free to
