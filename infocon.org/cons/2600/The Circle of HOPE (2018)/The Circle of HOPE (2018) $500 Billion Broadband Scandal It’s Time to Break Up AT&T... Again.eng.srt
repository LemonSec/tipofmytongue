1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
my name is Bruce Kushnick and I'm going

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,089
to talk about the 500 billion in

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,990
broadband scandal it's time to break up

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,120
AT&T again for those of you don't know

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,099
I've been a telecom analyst for 36 years

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,490
I work with a group called the ax

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,320
regulators at this point which are

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,810
former senior staff members of the FCC

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,160
the Attorney General's offices consumer

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,810
advocates and our goal is to actually

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,210
fix what's broken instead of keep

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,169
talking about it I've been doing this

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,090
for a very long time and 500 billion

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,739
broadband scandal is sort of an update

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,260
of the last book I wrote which but I'm

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,629
going to basically make you ask people

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,920
to pick one or the other if you take the

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,750
blue pill I think you'll wake up

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,610
tomorrow and not remember my name which

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,110
is probably a good thing take the red

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,829
pill you'll go what the hell was he

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,420
talking about okay I'll let me talk

23
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,550
about the history of broadband in

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,559
America which most of you probably may

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,930
know pieces of but I kind of doubt you

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,760
most of you know the whole truth and I'd

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,080
like to announce we had there was a

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,350
settlement yesterday I mean that last

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,170
week of a rise in New York we had been

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,089
working on this for seven years the nine

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,920
years total and what happened was is

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,780
Verizon New York has decided to settle

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,549
in the case where they are putting in

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,710
thirty two thousand ones of fiber optics

35
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,360
and unserved areas and they're supposed

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,798
to fix the copper that's been broken and

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,890
in areas that are not gonna be up great

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,659
for fiber and we estimated this to be a

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,740
better 300 millions a half billion

40
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,930
dollar settlement things take a little

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,850
time thank you very much however I'm

42
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,159
about to talk about another half

43
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,600
trillion dollars we've just found which

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,220
brings the total up to a ridiculous

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
amount of more than a trillion dollars

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,899
and if you think I'm not going to give

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,750
you some of the facts and some of the

48
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,119
data points that you can check yourself

49
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,280
I've written a couple of books on this

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,979
we believe that AT&T Verizon and

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,360
CenturyLink in the FCC intentionally

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,990
made the local phone networks

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,750
unprofitable the state utilities

54
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:07,979
starting around 2005 and in fact as I

55
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,318
will discuss it's a lot of money anyway

56
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,040
well right now we are currently in a

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,109
appeal of one of the FCC

58
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,269
decisions something about that backhaul

59
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,209
so I'm glad to talk about separately but

60
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,769
were our plan is to sue the FCC create a

61
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,980
model complaint that everybody in this

62
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,870
room and everybody in America can file

63
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,399
which basically is gonna say which I'll

64
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,750
go into in a little detail and we're

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,239
gonna call for the taking back of the

66
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,030
networks we paid for them they should be

67
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,680
more ours than their not for those who

68
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,620
don't know and we're gonna call for the

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,389
breakup of AT&T one more time now I

70
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,519
should give you some of my credentials I

71
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:48,909
started off in 1972 I was a dorm at MIT

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,669
and we were building these boxes that

73
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,108
would basically let you make unlimited

74
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,950
long distance calls ran around the world

75
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:59,769
for free by taking the box taking a tone

76
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,569
2600 getting disconnected a

77
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,980
long-distance operator and then going

78
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,040
wherever you wanted to now it turns out

79
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:09,159
that the dorm that I was in what's

80
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,409
called Bexley the basement of Bexley

81
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,750
that happened to be a unique feature

82
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,578
which was all the phone lines in the

83
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,579
entire Institute were in the basement of

84
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:23,769
Bexley so some of the dorm rooms had 912

85
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:26,139
phone lines however 2000 1972 we were

86
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,629
warned that the FCC sorry we were warned

87
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,459
that the FBI was coming to the dorm and

88
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:35,379
there was a banner which I don't have a

89
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:38,590
picture of we said welcome the FBI and

90
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,500
that's what the FBI agents I decided to

91
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:45,190
redact his face he said this is taking

92
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,349
the 1972 he actually has pencils and

93
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,489
page paper and they were like well how

94
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,290
did you rack up a half a million of them

95
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,229
details we were working with some guys

96
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,358
in California I started a company called

97
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:01,769
Apple specifically Woking apples a

98
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:04,900
friend of one of the guys in the dorm so

99
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,189
this was again but when it became with

100
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,959
telecom analyst they said well how do

101
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,168
you store it and I said well is very

102
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,989
interested in the technology of course

103
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,790
so I don't before 1980 this is ma Bell

104
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,310
ma Bell was the entire country's

105
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,238
telecommunications infrastructure they

106
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,530
also on long distance they also

107
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,630
you even had to buy the phone you rent

108
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,059
the phone from them and so essentially

109
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,219
it was one large corporation there's a

110
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,910
million customers see I'm not good this

111
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:36,919
thing at all

112
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:38,780
sorry that's well that's my book the

113
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,719
book of broken promises is free it's a

114
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,840
download it's online at the regulator's

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,479
org I don't know why it missed that

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,159
thing letting my back anyway there we go

117
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,280
the Bell System was basically a

118
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,090
collection of state utilities which most

119
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,090
people don't know

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,849
and so this Verizon there was a New York

121
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,549
telephone there was specific bailout in

122
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,409
California and so each of these separate

123
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,699
entities were actually in charge of the

124
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:07,969
entire infrastructure

125
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,949
however AT&T the parent was based in

126
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,229
charge of the oversight of all these

127
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,639
companies now with problematic is so

128
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,830
1980 so I should give you a little

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,150
history so MCI which was one thing with

130
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,419
the long-distance business and a bunch

131
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,070
of other players so he sued the AT&T and

132
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,979
it had something called the best mister

133
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,880
where they created seven baby bells now

134
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:34,460
these are the fattest babies of history

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,289
there was us west there was path Bell so

136
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,159
all of these people wanted to be Ma Bell

137
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,900
again and that's why well I'll get to

138
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,340
how this all happened but essentially

139
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,620
what happened was is all of these

140
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,900
companies were basically supposedly

141
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,000
supposed to compete with each other they

142
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,380
were supposed to go out and also wire

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,210
America with a fiber optic line that was

144
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,139
capable of 45 megabits in both

145
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,060
directions in the year 1992 okay so

146
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,490
here's what's going on 1991 there's a

147
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,560
clinton gore campaign is talking about

148
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,530
the information superhighway this was

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,389
basically a plan to just replace the

150
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,099
existing copper wire with a fiber optic

151
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,169
wire that basically would go to

152
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,810
everybody's home everybody's office by

153
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,948
the year 2010 and the speed of broadband

154
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,690
as listed in the state report state

155
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,180
proceedings including there was a guy

156
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,430
named Harry Newton at telecom library

157
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,820
and it's a published telecom dictionary

158
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,100
and

159
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,080
he had this was the speed of broadband

160
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,060
in the United States in 1992 now there

161
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,859
was a couple of problems with this so

162
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,530
this 45 megabits in both directions the

163
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,270
hard drives were only 40 Meg's so there

164
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,630
was a little disconnect between all this

165
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,770
now I I'm sorry and the information

166
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,950
superhighway which attracts me to talk

167
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,260
about basically was everywhere so if you

168
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,479
were to go read a newspaper magazine

169
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,580
listen online this is worse than 5 G's

170
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,280
wireless pipe this is sort of like

171
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,530
America is going to have you know fiber

172
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,890
optics coming soon to your TV starting

173
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,890
in 1996 now what most people don't know

174
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:15,110
so this is Pacific bells rollout of

175
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,790
fiber optics for California by the year

176
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,430
2000 they were supposed to be 5.5

177
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:24,440
million lines they're supposed to spend

178
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,990
16 billion dollars and but in 1997 they

179
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,090
had enrolled a squat and in fact they

180
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,310
pocketed the money now what you should

181
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,599
know is that in every state the phone

182
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,570
companies went to the states that you

183
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,430
know if only you changed the laws we

184
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,650
would be glad to go out and spend the

185
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,450
extra money on the infrastructure and

186
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,969
they gave them price caps which

187
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,510
basically said make as much as profits

188
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,850
as you want

189
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,820
don't worry about it and use that money

190
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,160
for the infrastructure not one state in

191
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,110
the last 20 years has ever gone back and

192
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,610
said excuse me where's the fiber optic

193
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,520
lines that you were supposed to put in

194
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,530
excuse me did you refund the 15 billion

195
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,109
dollars you collected for doing this

196
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:08,599
over this period of time this has never

197
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:11,570
happened so now for those of you who

198
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,320
think that I'm hitting this is a list of

199
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,050
the 22 filings at the FCC in 1993 and

200
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,330
four by little companies who basically

201
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,060
said well let's see it's kind of hard to

202
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,229
read it's in my book by the way what see

203
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,660
tonight it was supposed to have a

204
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,800
million lines put in permanent

205
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,160
AT&T owned it they were supposed to be

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,799
Cleveland Indianapolis Ohio most of the

207
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,610
East Coast there was a 1.2 million lines

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,289
and

209
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:45,050
and supposed to be up East Coast in the

210
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,640
million lines in this Columbia so what

211
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,449
happened was this this is a very

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,110
interesting thing

213
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:56,540
these models were all fraudulent now you

214
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:58,100
see I'm sitting there okay

215
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,959
so I'm sitting I go back I don't have

216
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,269
the bathroom I'm sitting there and

217
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,290
basically what happened was is I have a

218
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,790
consultant at this point to working for

219
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,209
have a degree with International Data

220
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,310
Corp in 1992 I helped roll out the first

221
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,079
three digit dialing service independent

222
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,060
dining service three five one one with

223
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,189
Cox newspapers

224
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,359
I was basically making a lot of money I

225
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,459
was traveling around the world and I was

226
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,870
talking about things like the

227
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,689
information superhighway until I

228
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,100
realized that there were holes this the

229
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,170
previous slide basically showed that

230
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,690
there was they claimed it was gonna cost

231
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,699
$750 to $1,000 to put in a fiber optic

232
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,440
line and that the set-top box would be

233
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,540
250 this is 1992 I don't think it was

234
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,149
capable of doing that you know we

235
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,399
couldn't do it for $10,000 into the year

236
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,680
2000 Kathy in the box the box had a

237
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,750
handle 45 megabits in both directions

238
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,430
video and sorry I made me that so the

239
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,779
other thing that happened at the break

240
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,160
up they made a couple of mistakes the

241
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,550
first mistake was they overcharged my

242
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,620
aunt Ethel $1,000 for this rotary phone

243
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,370
so I'm sitting there for AT&T and

244
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,690
Verizon and all these companies and

245
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,279
essentially I don't look at the pills

246
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,620
usually and I go to my own office house

247
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,060
and she has a rotary phone and her

248
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,399
caretakers saying yeah that's just my

249
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,209
aunt Ethel is 89 years old legally blind

250
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,920
with walkers and she's and I look at the

251
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,018
phone and I said you see me give me the

252
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,360
bills she gives me the bills and I'm a

253
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,640
this is incredible I typed them into a

254
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,620
spreadsheet find out that she paid over

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,630
a thousand dollars for a rotary phone

256
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,370
looks from 1980 1982 to like 1995 and I

257
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,949
was like this is this is unbelievable to

258
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,449
me I this is crazy

259
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,699
there was a case by the way about this

260
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:45,859
which I think there was like a hundred

261
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:48,680
million dollar settlement which we did

262
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,540
not take any way this thing triggered

263
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,859
something when I realized my clients

264
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,640
main

265
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,040
be telling me the truth about everything

266
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,960
and so I decided that it was time to

267
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,939
Furcal for a second divestiture

268
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,790
divestiture to the first to that gesture

269
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,680
broke up AT&T but it didn't open up the

270
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,589
oak the local phone networks for

271
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,270
competition and I was called a phone

272
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,990
bill fanatic by The Washington Times I

273
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,840
was very proud of that

274
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,820
and basically all of my former clients

275
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,050
called all of the press and said I

276
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,790
wouldn't talk to this guy anymore

277
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,729
he's no longer reliable he's gone off

278
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,730
the deep end which is probably true

279
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,020
I did write a report to warn people that

280
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,400
things were not going to happen the way

281
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,100
they thought I called the information

282
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,569
superhighway get a grip where they were

283
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,760
doing projections tomorrow there will be

284
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,100
48 million phone lines that'll be

285
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,590
fiber-optic by the year 2000 I guarantee

286
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:45,550
it and if you wait three more days we'll

287
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:47,830
throw into the TV set now 1996 three

288
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,150
things happen so let me just start let

289
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,610
me just backtrack for a second so I was

290
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,069
consoled for an International Data Corp

291
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,380
in 1986 who are talking about all the

292
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,210
wondrous new inter interactive services

293
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,210
oh by the way I did help roll out a

294
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,920
caller ID I wrote a report called

295
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,630
automatic number identification whoo in

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,180
1987 which basically was that you can

297
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,680
actually productize the phone number

298
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,300
that was used in the networks as

299
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,290
something that could be a residential

300
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,199
service no caller ID thank you very much

301
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,670
I also yes for blocking the police we

302
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,990
did a survey and it said 68% of the

303
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,729
populations did not want to give their

304
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,040
phone number out but 68% of the

305
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,690
population wanted to see the number they

306
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,430
weren't quite the same people but it

307
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,490
didn't matter

308
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,479
so it's 1990 so in 1992 I realized that

309
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,550
something is really wrong

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,550
so I create new networks we start doing

311
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,310
a big study on the breakup we also

312
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,890
started tracking all of the broadband

313
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,630
commitments so in 1996 three things

314
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,640
happened just gonna bring it with of

315
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,340
speed 1996 the Telecommunications Act of

316
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,710
1996 happens it says that the one errors

317
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,980
that are there have to be opened to

318
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,150
direct competition on all levels

319
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,540
Internet service provision providing

320
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:05,520
broadband motorist

321
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,660
why data services it didn't matter to

322
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,060
the phone companies decided to go out

323
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,569
and marry each other we know this is an

324
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,239
act against God when siblings married

325
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,950
yes at nature and the internet hits now

326
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,839
the after seeing well you know as some

327
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,580
first old guys the internet was

328
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,190
basically like a creaky old thing that

329
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,920
you had to have somebody help you you oh

330
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,540
that's a modem okay that's a dial-up

331
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,160
what do I have to do I have to call

332
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,980
these 15 numbers I gotta see if it works

333
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,680
okay it was wasn't any and the the the

334
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,630
graphic interface was basically a shaky

335
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,069
thing you would put it up and he says

336
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:49,450
that doesn't look anything like this at

337
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:51,459
all ever so now the mergers the AT&T was

338
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,110
basically created by it come by SBC

339
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,520
which was one of the bail companies and

340
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,310
it married packed Bell which was

341
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,600
California and then married southern New

342
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,209
England telephone which is Connecticut

343
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,079
then it married Ameritech which was the

344
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:11,349
five states Ohio Indiana Ohio Indiana

345
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:13,149
Wisconsin Michigan and Illinois oh thank

346
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,250
you very much and BellSouth which was

347
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,899
the last merger and then it took over

348
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,430
AT&T and I'll explain that for a second

349
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,620
and Verizon was formed by the merger of

350
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,050
Atlantic which was the bottom part of

351
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,649
the East Coast to Virginia to New Jersey

352
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:29,949
and Narayan X which was from New York up

353
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,450
through Maine and it took GTE which were

354
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,279
all these little places all over the

355
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,779
country a competent country and it also

356
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,459
took the MCI u.s. West which is Montana

357
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,529
or watching the state was basically the

358
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,869
thing called what turned into quest and

359
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,029
then now essentially so if you have its

360
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,510
three companies that were formed out of

361
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,470
all these other companies and it wasn't

362
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,959
really a good thing because they

363
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:56,320
controlled the wires and the state

364
00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:01,180
utilities now SBC I love this merger

365
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,839
SBC and is five states in Ohio and SPS

366
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,750
are SPC is now Pac Bell Connecticut and

367
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,709
Texas Oklahoma and a bunch of states of

368
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,620
it and it'll go through more and then

369
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,959
Mara tech was the Ohio Indiana

370
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,840
so they decide to merge they're gonna be

371
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,210
in 30 cities out of their region in 30

372
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,430
and 30 months okay they're gonna compete

373
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,170
and so this was supposed to make

374
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,000
everybody excited because they were

375
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,280
going to go out and have direct

376
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,860
competition for the other belt companies

377
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,900
well it turns out that the FCC in like

378
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,050
one of these clauses we found basically

379
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,610
said you can basically just say that

380
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:43,469
you've done that city if you have three

381
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,180
unaffiliated customers in that city I'm

382
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,940
sitting there going I can get more in a

383
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,890
bar it's offering free beer to sign up

384
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,300
for the design of his phone service but

385
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,900
three customers that's all they got in a

386
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,400
certain city so after state they file

387
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,459
with the FCC Klieman we fulfill their

388
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,560
obligations we have 30 cities and maybe

389
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,080
a couple hundred people but they were

390
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,130
supposed to have a fair it says we're

391
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,770
supposed to have 10 million customers

392
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,140
and and they never got maybe you know

393
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:14,040
squat number so that merger basically

394
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,970
was just a made-up thing the telecom

395
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,709
acted when they were opened up the

396
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,840
network's also created Internet service

397
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:22,470
providers most people don't know this

398
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,870
but in the year 2001 there were 9335

399
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,150
Internet service providers offering the

400
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,010
majority of customers in the United

401
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,010
States most the majority of subscribers

402
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,410
internet service and broadband service

403
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:37,140
it was not the big telcos offering the

404
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:41,699
service it was the small nice in fact in

405
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:44,640
New York City there were 331 ISPs

406
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,480
advertising in just New York City in

407
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,620
stiffener we have as you know to up

408
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,740
their service providers everybody else

409
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,230
going and what do we do now right pal

410
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,960
closed the networks so the FCC is taking

411
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,590
over by the Republicans in 2001 and mike

412
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,050
powell who's the chairman basically he

413
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,550
basically says you know we don't want to

414
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,260
have any of these pesky competitors

415
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,300
around why don't we just close the

416
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,829
networks and what we'll do is how do we

417
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,700
close it we're basically going to say

418
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:16,800
that the Verizon sorry since AT&T which

419
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,150
was SPC at the time said we are gonna

420
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,770
have fibre to the home

421
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:26,370
in 2004 five of the home 2040s BC is

422
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,879
AT&T okay just keep this in mind and BC

423
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:33,360
never rolled out fibre to the home in

424
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,559
2004 and rolled out u-verse so the

425
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,199
networks are closed based on this

426
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,930
promise that was a lie

427
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,590
so the ISPs had a big riot run-up and

428
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:47,340
then basically 7000 ISPs were basically

429
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,470
gotten rid of by these caveats which had

430
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,419
nothing to do whatsoever with the

431
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,820
quality of the service or a market power

432
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,400
this was the FCC decided that we don't

433
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,790
need competition anymore and it worked

434
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,530
but all these ISPs out of business so

435
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,170
there were 7000 ISPs that were killed

436
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,360
off the way they killed them all off was

437
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,800
they made the what the the broadband

438
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,159
network of the Internet network one

439
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,450
thing which turns into net neutrality so

440
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,850
when people say how does that neutrality

441
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,950
formed net neutrality was not formed by

442
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,659
you know here and there as this was we

443
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,070
chilled well full of the competitors and

444
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,690
we decided that with the way to do this

445
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,010
was we would make the broadband and

446
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,010
Internet service an information service

447
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,559
title one and get rid of title two and

448
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,290
so and the reason this was important was

449
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,450
because title two allowed the internet

450
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,730
providers to use the network's it was

451
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,840
common carriage title one is an

452
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,600
information service they didn't have to

453
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,639
rent it out this killed offline sharing

454
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,800
by the way you know where a company

455
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,600
could go out and use the wires and it

456
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,460
basically shipped out MCI and AT&T is

457
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,990
the largest competitors because those

458
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,730
guys couldn't rent the network's easily

459
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,230
anymore and they were the two largest

460
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,750
competitors so they would put a business

461
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,330
they were thinking over so Humpty Dumpty

462
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,740
was basically put back together again so

463
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,790
you had one comp

464
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,280
you'll have three companies now that

465
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,020
control both the infrastructure of the

466
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,990
telecommunications side which are the

467
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,580
estate utilities they controlled or they

468
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,170
control the wireless companies because

469
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,300
they control the infrastructure of the

470
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,660
state utilities most people don't know

471
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:19,080
that Wireless requires a higher and in

472
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,150
fact this and in fact the punchline is

473
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,620
basically this FCC is trying to get rid

474
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,960
of all the rest the remaining

475
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,379
regulations that are left and I'll go

476
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,250
over that in a second now I was on the

477
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,310
FCC consumer advisory committee

478
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,710
point in 2003 I was trying to defend the

479
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,570
faith I was working with one of the guys

480
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,370
who was a phone bill Auditor we would go

481
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,520
out and we have took a bunch of class

482
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,860
actions about phone bills overcharging

483
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,280
three of which we settled and one thank

484
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,169
God

485
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,790
anyway what happened was is when I'm on

486
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,170
the FCC consumer advisory committee and

487
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,659
we're trying to talk about truth in

488
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,700
billing and we have one of the experts

489
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,840
who does truth in billing and we have

490
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,080
what we've just collected all these

491
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,780
bills in New York and New Jersey and the

492
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,389
committee says it's great idea but we're

493
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,040
not to have you speak I well what do you

494
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,480
mean you're not having me speak well no

495
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,100
no you have these other people speak

496
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,390
which was the Wireless Association spoke

497
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,070
cuz I was made me very happy there was

498
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,870
the phone company association spoke and

499
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,220
one of the advocates spoke except they

500
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,889
didn't really address the stuff that we

501
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,820
put on the table so I decided to find

502
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,160
out who all these people in the room

503
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,929
were and realized that the majority of

504
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,970
the people in the room verizon was on

505
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,840
the committee

506
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,420
they've been on the committee since it

507
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,760
started it had it had all of these other

508
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,530
groups like the Wireless Association but

509
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,480
it has all these astroturf groups these

510
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,370
were fake consumer groups that were

511
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,520
located in DC coming out of a lobbying

512
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:45,070
firm that basically is it no no we do

513
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,980
long-distance we do Hispanic and we do

514
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,050
you know we do poor people and we do I

515
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,970
mean all the different ethnic groups

516
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,060
they decide to have different committees

517
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,350
and so I decided to out them which was

518
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,750
that the Washington Post to write a

519
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,459
story and I was not asked back on the

520
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,380
committee

521
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,600
the most recent committee that happened

522
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,970
there same kind of story is current

523
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,189
which is the there's a Fingal be DAC

524
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,990
which is the broadband broadband

525
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,280
whatever it is and it's a bunch of

526
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,430
things that are trying to get rid of the

527
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:19,210
rights of the states to be able to deal

528
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,770
with their own infrastructure and get

529
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,780
rid of the cities and basically make the

530
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,879
FCC control everything and one of the

531
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,230
guys man from San Jose said you know you

532
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,530
guys are just giving away the store here

533
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:33,250
and he left the committee so this is not

534
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:36,700
this is this was 2003 it's a little

535
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,720
later gonna kit so I don't want to think

536
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,450
that I'm just picking on the phone

537
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,600
companies the cable companies also did

538
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,179
some things that you should know about

539
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,639
they said also we are going to give run

540
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:51,090
man to America if you just let us raise

541
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,070
our rates and add up to five dollars a

542
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,590
month so that we can go out and build

543
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,409
this new infrastructure and basically

544
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:03,600
they said okay that sounds great but it

545
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:07,710
expires in 2001 well it turns out this

546
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,178
sublet but never got take it off the

547
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,480
extra five dollars it's still based

548
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,460
built in third of the rates they just

549
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,530
kept adding adding and adding more money

550
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,030
to the same things without ever looking

551
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,960
at how much profits the listed companies

552
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,360
were making anymore

553
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,900
I will also have to know that basically

554
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,709
in the agreement Comcast will also

555
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,659
provide a modem and modders modem

556
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,980
service to all such schools within a

557
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:37,679
year that didn't happen either so the

558
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,070
FCC really doesn't do a lot of oversight

559
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,409
and also by the way Time Warner I did

560
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:47,220
some analysis of their revenues and

561
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:49,049
expenses the local the the broadband

562
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,270
service has a 97 percent of profit

563
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,760
margin because as I'll explain what

564
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,710
happened with local phone service they

565
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,799
decided to double the expenses into the

566
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,570
basic rate of the utility or in this

567
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,210
case the cable service and then all the

568
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,250
other services get a free ride now I

569
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,860
have to come back once before you know I

570
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,960
leave the mergers AT&T was always one of

571
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,350
my favorite mergers this was BellSouth

572
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,380
AT&T in 2006 when they filed this they

573
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,480
said in 2007 we will have 100% coverage

574
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,990
of broadband in the United States in our

575
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,610
22 states here is the language and then

576
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,070
we find that it's a slow court ban the

577
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,799
18 the FCC's broadband speeds believe it

578
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,770
or not was 200 Tay in one direction in

579
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,559
this year so they said well we'll do

580
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,889
200k however they never as we know later

581
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,678
we filed a case against AT&T they never

582
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,909
actually rolled out the broadband in any

583
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,429
place because this would require them to

584
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:45,840
do at least DSL and they didn't want to

585
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:47,970
go out and do it in DSL so they

586
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,139
basically just let all these underserved

587
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,140
areas become unserved

588
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,290
okay so part two of the broadband

589
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:59,070
scandal

590
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,899
a lot of people don't know is that

591
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,129
Verizon and AT&T after they closed the

592
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,660
networks after they get rid of all the

593
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,040
competitors say we're gonna roll up

594
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,260
broadband really we were rolling out

595
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,850
fiber-optic broadband and Verizon

596
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,190
actually did roll out FiOS which was a

597
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,649
fiber optic broadband service except for

598
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,630
the fact that it is title two it is

599
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,760
common carriers and it is paid for by

600
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,940
local phone customers and dumped into

601
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,670
the local rates now you could say what

602
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,760
so the FiOS watt fiber optic wire

603
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:30,460
basically was and I read this is from

604
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,620
New York State it's basically part of

605
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,960
the state utility and it's just an

606
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,489
upgrade of the existing wires and they

607
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,710
have and its title to which is very

608
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,680
important because Verizon keeps telling

609
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,540
the FCC that that the broadband stuff in

610
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,820
the internet stuff or title 1 and title

611
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,720
2 harms their investment this is the

612
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,780
investment this is how they this I'll

613
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,190
get to that in the same now the Public

614
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,680
Service Commission in New York says

615
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,940
quote we're going to give rate increases

616
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,610
for the masses of the deployment of

617
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,830
fiber optics this is 2009 they gave

618
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,719
three rate increases they raise rates 84

619
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,490
percent in New York with basically

620
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,720
because they they needed the money I

621
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,150
mean they they're gonna build up this

622
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,890
massive deployment of fiber optics 2010

623
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:18,010
Verizon stops rolling up fiber optics

624
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,920
now what's going on and this is the

625
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,750
larger of the scandals which we're only

626
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,990
kept finding more and more crap about in

627
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:28,120
the last year so fir isin is the state

628
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:31,360
utility the state utility basically is

629
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,520
as I just pointed out is has the fiber

630
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,899
optic wires as part of the state utility

631
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,280
even though everybody thinks it's just

632
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,650
the copper wires that it is and this is

633
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,050
paid for by the phone customers I

634
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,440
there's the proof of that and in New

635
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,840
York

636
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,490
basically we made them understand that

637
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,709
they were paying for the fiber optic

638
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,200
wires and that basically this was kind

639
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,240
of crazy because and and being titled -

640
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,920
but nobody really cared about the part

641
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,200
that's called the cross-subsidies part

642
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,570
which is what we found so what's going

643
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,970
on is Verizon was able to take the

644
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,919
expenses and dump them into the state

645
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,600
utility making the local wires look

646
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,220
unprofitable while at the same time

647
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,790
making all the other services that they

648
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,780
have be very profitable and

649
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,480
did this by the way and I just want make

650
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,770
sure that you know that Verizon is

651
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,350
charging local phone customers for the

652
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,420
wires to the cell sites in fact we have

653
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,820
friend Shamu saying the fact of the

654
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,220
matter is why our wireline Capitol and I

655
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,689
don't want to get the numbers pretty but

656
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,670
they're pretty substantial it's being

657
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,250
spent on the wireline side of the house

658
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,710
to support the wireless growth so the IP

659
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,870
backbone the data transmission the wires

660
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,420
to the cell this is all in the wireline

661
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,689
books know what this means is that

662
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,610
basically grandma the people who didn't

663
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,690
get fiber-optic services upstate New

664
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,179
York or anywhere else

665
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,940
basically we're charged for the wires to

666
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:54,030
the cell sites we don't think we don't

667
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,650
think this is legal by the way okay and

668
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,080
everybody is going Wireless we do know

669
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,460
this okay but the thing that's positive

670
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,710
when people talk about the wireless

671
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,840
first 5g is just you know another high

672
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,170
place information superhighway 5g is

673
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,990
essentially I have to say it goes block

674
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,670
or two at this point it basically will

675
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,010
just and it requires a fiber optic wire

676
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,980
so nobody in the rural areas will be

677
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:19,020
wiring for 5g also the bottom line is

678
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,320
that almost all the regular self service

679
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,910
goes up back to the fiber optic wire and

680
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,379
companies know this so the five the

681
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,060
wireless service doesn't pay for the

682
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,250
construction and it's not paying for the

683
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,040
access fees it's basically 55 percent

684
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:36,570
profits while local service loses money

685
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,340
he loses money now we the FCC by the way

686
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,710
and the states are all playing with the

687
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,649
numbers when you say to me well how many

688
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:47,220
lines are there I will say in New York

689
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:50,130
if you look at the basically v 79th

690
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,620
street all of these wires almost half of

691
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,210
them are not counted as wires access

692
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,919
line it's half of them are not being so

693
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,140
oh we're losing all these lines

694
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,510
well you're not counting most of the

695
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,980
lines that you are gaining from all

696
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,050
these other services like the wires to

697
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,930
the cell sites or the fiber optic wires

698
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,210
so this this way of playing with the

699
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,150
numbers is a standard operating

700
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,880
procedure at the FCC as well

701
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:19,270
now Verizon just self and what and we

702
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,070
asked for was basically to say

703
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,470
you shouldn't be cross subsidizing these

704
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,500
other businesses this is not necessarily

705
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:31,330
legal and not only that but if you cross

706
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:34,150
subsidize them you should sell honey yes

707
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:37,510
okay so we did find which is zombie

708
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,490
rules this is this is about as crazy as

709
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:44,230
it possibly could get into the year 2000

710
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,570
the FCC sets the it's how the expenses

711
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:51,520
will be allocated to the different lines

712
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:55,540
of business the year 2000 never changed

713
00:28:51,520 --> 00:29:00,610
for 18 years and is frozen that's it so

714
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:02,680
in New York New York Verizon New York

715
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,740
the state utility lost two point six

716
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:11,230
billion dollars in 2017 just so you know

717
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:13,890
you know May 31st 2017 Verizon 2017 New

718
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,060
York 2017 annual report came out and

719
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,210
people like me this is sort of like

720
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:21,879
Nirvana we have real numbers and what we

721
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,230
found was Verizon not only lost 2.6

722
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,260
billion dollars but local service lost

723
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,330
2.9 billion dollars this is just the

724
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,450
local services about a billion dollars

725
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,490
of revenue at a 5 billion of Verizon New

726
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,530
York and local service basically on the

727
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,630
regular phone lines now how does the

728
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,240
phone lines lose two points the two

729
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,490
point nine billion dollars well the way

730
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,580
they did it was local service had one

731
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,710
point eight billion dollars of corporate

732
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:53,110
operations expense dumped into the state

733
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:56,100
utility the executive jets the the

734
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:59,439
executive pay the foundation grant money

735
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:02,250
the lawyers the lobbyists is thrown into

736
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,650
local service category for calculations

737
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,610
local services than unprofitable

738
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,550
automatically local service also paid

739
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,709
one point two billion dollars in 2017

740
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:14,590
for construction this is the copper

741
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,180
copper wires were talking about Verizon

742
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,290
spent about a hundred million dollars

743
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,260
hundred twenty five million dollars on

744
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,540
those wires so what we found was all of

745
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,980
these things now how did you get how did

746
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,450
they get one point eight billion dollars

747
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,730
how did they get one point two billion

748
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,180
dollars and how do they charge all local

749
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,509
service it's very straightforward by the

750
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,639
league in two thousand

751
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:36,679
Verizon local service has 65 percent of

752
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:40,668
revenues paid 65 percent of the of the

753
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,139
expenses in 2017 local service pays they

754
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:45,320
had 21 percent of the revenues and

755
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:47,599
paying 60 percent of the expenses it

756
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,629
didn't change the expenses basically

757
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:53,269
stayed flat all these years this way of

758
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:56,269
gaining the local networks to be

759
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:58,519
unprofitable was all on paper I hate to

760
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:01,009
tell you this the digital divide it was

761
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,899
created this way because they said we

762
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:05,389
know we're not gonna it's expensive to

763
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:07,879
do the other areas well in the utility

764
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:09,408
there we've in New York State and the

765
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,478
rural and the urban areas are paying

766
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,399
more so that the rural areas get wired

767
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:14,719
and we're also paying for the wires

768
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,569
it wasn't like they're taking it out of

769
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:20,449
their own budgets so zombie rules are

770
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:21,979
the rules in 2000 the rules that are

771
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:25,339
talking about which are cost accounting

772
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:28,339
rules were put in we in 2000 then in

773
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:30,649
2007 they decided to erase the the FCC

774
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:32,208
decided to erase the tracks get rid of

775
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:35,689
anybody that could follow it by getting

776
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:39,079
rid of they used to publish since 1939

777
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,029
all of the information about each state

778
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,668
utility how much money it was making the

779
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:46,129
expenses and everything else in 2007

780
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:49,969
they erased the entire collection of all

781
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:51,589
data in 2007 they they all filed at the

782
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:53,119
FCC to get rid of all the accounting

783
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,769
rules so that nobody can track this

784
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,728
anymore

785
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,279
Brenden car who's the current

786
00:31:55,729 --> 00:32:00,919
commissioner the FCC was Verizon's

787
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:04,729
Attorney in 2007 when they filed to get

788
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,379
rid of the accounting rules sorry I'm

789
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:07,940
gonna cracked me up so essentially what

790
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:10,339
you so essentially what you have and

791
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,199
then in 2017 the first thing the FCC

792
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:13,908
decided to do was to do weed whacking

793
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:16,309
and get rid of the accounting rules and

794
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:18,139
I always wondered what hi well because

795
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,819
it turns out that in order to get rid of

796
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:22,309
all of the rules there are sins that are

797
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:25,129
still left hanging that basically hold

798
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:26,779
them hold them hostage of course for the

799
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:28,428
public and they're getting it erase

800
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,049
those New York State is the only state

801
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:34,629
we know of that actually publishes all

802
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:34,629
of the financials so

803
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,960
here's what we're suggested we just got

804
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,580
back you know we're going after the

805
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,260
companies because there's nothing left

806
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,270
to do we want them to basically go after

807
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,560
we're going after all the money we

808
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,510
believe is enough money to get America

809
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,820
wired with fiber we believe that it's

810
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,800
been basically allowed to be divert the

811
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,500
construction budgets diverted into these

812
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,879
other buckets we let the state utilities

813
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,950
have basically been used as a cash

814
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,590
machine and we believe that everybody's

815
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,540
rates here or up 30 to 50 percent more

816
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:07,080
than they should be let me get the basic

817
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,450
example local service is now $57 about

818
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,669
the Verizon collects per month on just

819
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:17,430
the wired copper service it should cost

820
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:19,200
for so are 1012 the wireless services

821
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,910
that we use are based on the effect that

822
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,110
they all go back to the wires and the

823
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,210
wires are controlled by these companies

824
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,899
the wires that go to the cell sites have

825
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:30,900
a fifty sixty five percent profit margin

826
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,970
why because they get away with it so

827
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,280
what we're doing is we're saying that's

828
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,170
we're done it's time to go after them

829
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,810
and we've been calling for the audits

830
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,360
and of the subsidiaries getting rid of

831
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:45,300
them but our goal up now is the FCC is

832
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:48,090
out to screw us literally and

833
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,270
figuratively so if you look at what the

834
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,980
FCC is done what it does is figure this

835
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:57,330
is I think of this us is just like a

836
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,190
large hog on a spit and they're just

837
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:01,409
cutting up all that stuff away

838
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,300
they're basically all of our rights are

839
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,490
being taken away slowly because of the

840
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,100
fact that they can allow the companies

841
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,320
to control the wire to control the

842
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,239
services over the wire including that's

843
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,880
why the net neutrality wasn't important

844
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,399
to control the privacy when you sign up

845
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,980
for service they get to now if it's not

846
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,929
a basically a regular phone service they

847
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,690
get to you know take take the data that

848
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,250
you have and say oh we're gonna use it

849
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,960
this is not common carriage common

850
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,880
carriage is keep your hands off

851
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,409
my data you know we are the right way

852
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,940
it's our you're just supposed to be a

853
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,000
pipe you're not supposed to go out and

854
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,790
and say oh would you like to buy this

855
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,489
buy this Bangalore you know and anything

856
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,020
else this is not your job your job is to

857
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:45,000
give us the best broadband at the

858
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,969
cheapest price and make sure that it's

859
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,250
fast

860
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:50,709
now because of the fact that they just

861
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,750
left most of America hanging what happen

862
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,250
was by 2010 they just said we're done in

863
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,530
Raqqa bother with anymore upgrades or

864
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,540
anything upstate New York basically the

865
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,670
reason why there was the settlement with

866
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,950
because the the CWA the Union guys

867
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,349
testified saying well the wire was put

868
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,770
in the 70s was there were 60s and was

869
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:10,750
never changed so you have people with 40

870
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,009
50 year old wires that basically are

871
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,990
riding and they didn't do anything from

872
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,740
40 or 50 years the budgets we're never

873
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,419
there so our take now is that the FCC's

874
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,089
plan just so you know is to erase all

875
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,240
the accounting rules to erase privacy

876
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:29,170
get rid got rid of net neutrality to go

877
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:34,209
out and basically allow them to shut off

878
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:36,970
the copper to the preamp the state laws

879
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,099
preempt the city laws pretty much do

880
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,290
whatever they want and it's you have to

881
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:43,810
understand from my perspective 5g is

882
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:46,569
just a shiny bauble which is basically

883
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,490
being used oh the new technology we

884
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:51,400
definitely get to do that just to race

885
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,828
the laws sure we'll definitely do that I

886
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,990
mean no offense but deja vu you know

887
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:57,880
I've worked on these books for years

888
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,799
this is exactly what's going on

889
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,349
so our tech is is we have to stop the

890
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,569
FCC we can't let this go on if the FCC

891
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,579
erases the rest of the rules it'll be

892
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:08,020
very hard to go back to the last layer

893
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,480
now most people don't know this is the

894
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,450
estate utility we you know Verizon New

895
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,220
York is a state utility and we just and

896
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,480
I'll tell you it's the state utility we

897
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,660
have to make sure that people know that

898
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,609
and they offer broadband the only thing

899
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,140
is we can't use the state utility as we

900
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:29,049
thought we should because basically it's

901
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:30,490
been handed over to these guys so we

902
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,660
believe that what should happen next is

903
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,759
we should separate the companies from

904
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,078
the wires

905
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,720
we've talked about this I've talked

906
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,589
about this since 1992 in fact I was

907
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,109
wearing a suit and I thought people

908
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:43,509
gonna throw tomatoes at me you know

909
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:45,700
no no duck especially especially my

910
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,260
former clients so I think what we have

911
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,368
to do now is we really have to think

912
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,290
through the the the harms that we have

913
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,810
and what are the other solutions but

914
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,069
there aren't that many other solutions

915
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,220
unless we separate the wireless company

916
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,990
from the wireline company

917
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,430
this the wires are going to be handed

918
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,359
over to this company's private property

919
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:07,640
that's not a good thing so and also all

920
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,340
of these mergers with them controlling

921
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,950
content why what does it have to do with

922
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,500
the the offering of great service to us

923
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:18,439
in each state now these are state based

924
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,060
utilities just keep this in mind so we

925
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,290
have the right to basic we should have

926
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,330
the right to use these state based

927
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,880
utilities because we're basically paid

928
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,859
for them over and over and over I mean

929
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,440
we the five hundred billion dollars was

930
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,569
tracked starting in nineteen ninety five

931
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,680
or six and where I started realizing

932
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,260
that the all the state laws are being

933
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,520
changed and so it really is over five

934
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,680
hundred billion dollars that collected

935
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,150
this new scandal where we figured out

936
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,560
that they were being able to cross

937
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,359
subsidize all the other lines of

938
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,799
business and then essentially they

939
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,440
decided to intentionally make local

940
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,430
service look unprofitable so that they

941
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,640
wouldn't have to go out and do the

942
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,509
wiring and use it as excuses I think we

943
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,118
can a I'm on it

944
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,619
so my job now is to say anybody who

945
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,210
wants to join us we're looking for

946
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,300
people to help we're gonna be raising

947
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,190
money to sue that head of the FCC so

948
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,720
part of my French and we're gonna try to

949
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,550
separate get the wat all the affiliates

950
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,098
to start paying market prices which

951
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:12,170
means that Verizon Wireless has to pay

952
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:14,690
the same price as everybody else that's

953
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,030
not legal for Verizon is charge them set

954
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,220
their own affiliate less money than they

955
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,650
do Sprint but that's what came out of

956
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,109
the investigation that we did into New

957
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,990
York and so well the New York settlement

958
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:29,299
which just happened basically did not go

959
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,859
as far as we wanted it to we're gonna

960
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,420
basically create a model complaint and

961
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:34,430
file in every state that we can get

962
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,290
people who go out and help us and file

963
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,299
in every city I have every city file and

964
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,460
say how many lines are there in our city

965
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,260
how much money did you charge us for all

966
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:47,210
these wires now there is one other place

967
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,150
known as dark fiber for those of you

968
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,349
don't know Verizon and AT&T and all

969
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,510
these companies have been putting in

970
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:57,440
fiber-optic wires continually since the

971
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:59,030
1990s it never stopped if that 50% of

972
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,790
all the fiber-optic wires in the United

973
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:04,609
States are all dark now they're on the

974
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,710
books somewhere there are maps somewhere

975
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:09,049
but nobody's actually talking about this

976
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,700
and from my perspective taking the dark

977
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,960
fiber those already paid for back and

978
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,029
using it for

979
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,109
what we want to use it for which is

980
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:20,540
really fast really cheap really good and

981
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,460
and keep your hands off of my my bits I

982
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,140
think is the next step and also opens

983
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,240
all competition anybody who wants to use

984
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,410
the wires would be able to use it which

985
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,779
is what the Telecommunications Act

986
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,118
basically said but they started

987
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:37,580
whittling away year by year so really um

988
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:41,390
you have any more slides no well thank

989
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,830
you very much I like questions people

990
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:48,680
who want to you know play with us let me

991
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:50,390
know I can't see a thing for you

992
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,790
we're here whether they're people hands

993
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:59,690
race oh yeah are you taking questions

994
00:39:52,790 --> 00:40:02,420
yes I'm the biker guys okay lights a

995
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,890
little brighter so you referred a few

996
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,560
times to promises that have been made

997
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,259
that haven't been kept yes so and about

998
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,849
the and you talked about the regulatory

999
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,140
authorities who it seems like you're

1000
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,520
implying that could have done something

1001
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,368
so I'm just curious about the details of

1002
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,830
that like is did they not do anything

1003
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,839
because they not hold the utilities

1004
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,420
accountable because of regulatory

1005
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,070
capture only or is it also because the

1006
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,750
structure doesn't really let them like

1007
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,460
did the authorities only have a chance

1008
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,349
to say yes or no because there was a

1009
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,480
merger on the table or because a

1010
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:35,150
ratemaking was happening like do they

1011
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,070
have an opportunity even structurally to

1012
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,830
go back now and say hey you did not do

1013
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,510
this okay so the statute of limitations

1014
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,270
would say you can't go back 20 years and

1015
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,310
look at this the cross subsidies are

1016
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:49,310
current the stuff I just brought up at

1017
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:51,859
the end which are we can't go after and

1018
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,359
there's yeah in New York 3.7 billion

1019
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:56,450
dollars was overcharged as far as we can

1020
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,520
tell to just local service so can the

1021
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:00,830
states do anything yes they have the

1022
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,349
power to can the FCC do anything

1023
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:05,180
yes but the FCC is useless the FCC has

1024
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:07,880
taken over the chair of the FCC is a

1025
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,149
former Verizon attorney the it's Ernie

1026
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,349
for Verizon on this on this document you

1027
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,470
know to get rid of the counting rules

1028
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:17,960
was was Brendan car so my feeling in has

1029
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:21,770
been and we've we've been doing this

1030
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,330
very long time in 97 the new jersey rate

1031
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,940
payer advocates stood up and said you

1032
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,710
know

1033
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,099
you guys didn't perform as you said you

1034
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:33,869
were going to and so they were able to

1035
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:37,049
get some concessions for wiring the for

1036
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:38,369
wiring the schools in 2008 and the fact

1037
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,839
that I couldn't listen how many times

1038
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:42,329
they've been challenges about this is

1039
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,250
embarrassing to the country my feeling

1040
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,420
is is most people after ye after 18

1041
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,819
months nobody remembers that there's

1042
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,410
even a law and then I'll give my

1043
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:50,819
favorite one is in New Jersey I was

1044
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,339
testifying and I was telling him about

1045
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:55,140
the history of broadband not one of the

1046
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:57,650
commissioners knew the history while

1047
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,670
they were about to give them a franchise

1048
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,180
so I think that the truth that matters

1049
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,500
is it's holding first they don't know I

1050
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,879
guarantee you that most of the people

1051
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,640
don't know what happened in their state

1052
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,740
making them understand that is one - all

1053
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,868
the core subsidies I believe are not

1054
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,118
legal in some states I don't believe you

1055
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:18,210
can go out and charge for you know the

1056
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,400
wireless build-out or charged 18 1.8

1057
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,140
billion dollars in new york for

1058
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,700
corporate operations expense now the

1059
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,020
state basically doesn't want to look at

1060
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,140
this stuff because it's opening a can of

1061
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,329
worms and I'll tell you Cuomo actually

1062
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,710
probably killed off in New York the

1063
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:33,079
governor probably killed off the

1064
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,180
investigation of the wireless

1065
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:39,839
cross-subsidy because he put a 5g bill

1066
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:45,808
into the middle of the budget last year

1067
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,750
so we rise in the head of Verizon in New

1068
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:51,630
York and New Jersey happens to have been

1069
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,549
his economic adviser so do Delius is a

1070
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,440
there's for everything you listed

1071
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:57,450
there's probably some things that

1072
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,770
happened in every state but for the most

1073
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,149
part nobody's ever really just sat down

1074
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,650
and said okay we're gonna go after this

1075
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:06,450
oh I will say in 2012 to city we've got

1076
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,180
two cities wired in still creaking

1077
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,069
Greenwich in New Jersey because on the

1078
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,009
books it actually said that they were

1079
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:15,839
required by law to go out and get 100

1080
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,940
percent of the state for fiber optics

1081
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,009
and didn't do it so we actually were

1082
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,710
able to hold them accountable because

1083
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:25,470
the state made a mistake and and

1084
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,779
actually issued a show-cause order of

1085
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,399
why they hadn't done the work this of

1086
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:32,039
course was rectified by Governor

1087
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,930
Christie coming in putting in one of his

1088
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,029
staffers to the state commission and

1089
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,279
creating a stipulation agreement this is

1090
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:39,080
it's over

1091
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,360
you likely have to do this again and now

1092
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:45,770
Wireless is a substitute for basic you

1093
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:48,770
know fiber so can we make a change in

1094
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:51,110
New York this one current settlement is

1095
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,390
to start but we're gonna be taking them

1096
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,640
taking these to get to court especially

1097
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,740
the FCC because we believe that the

1098
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,089
FCC's data is corrupted and so badly

1099
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,390
that we might be able to hold him

1100
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:04,940
accountable in every state the FCC's

1101
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,830
rules that were corrupted are in every

1102
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,630
state there are federal rules so every

1103
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,960
phone company how to use them we just

1104
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:15,830
don't have the books to prove this that

1105
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,900
I kind of answer people who liked your

1106
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:20,270
talk who else should they read or listen

1107
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,800
to on this topic as someone like Tim Wu

1108
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,680
for example who wrote a book or the

1109
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,360
master switch a good guide are basically

1110
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,839
where else can they start to learn more

1111
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:32,840
about this tip is actually a I like this

1112
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,460
book and I think each Asia the the Susan

1113
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,420
Crawford had there's a whole bunch of

1114
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,670
people that have different points of

1115
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,620
view about this Susan Crawford is

1116
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,270
another person that's been had brought a

1117
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,790
book on this stuff and it's becoming

1118
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,530
more radicalized but the truth of the

1119
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:48,529
matter is is the stories have not really

1120
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:52,070
been told I've been doing this now for a

1121
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,870
very long time and you know if you type

1122
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,780
in my name and Verizon to find that that

1123
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:59,060
I wrote 90% of the stories and or

1124
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,670
somebody quoted the stories that I wrote

1125
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:04,490
so I think that we have to change this I

1126
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,740
think when we start our play now as to

1127
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,660
do this model complaint and get hundreds

1128
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,950
of groups to file at the same time we're

1129
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,569
gonna be asking for how much money was

1130
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,149
collected how many lines are there today

1131
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:16,190
but I mean and also the core subsidy

1132
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,940
stuff how much did the wireless company

1133
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,200
of the construction budgets go to them

1134
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,510
and I think that nobody's asked these

1135
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,100
questions and I think now if we can get

1136
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:27,560
different groups around the country to

1137
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,440
file at the same time with our complaint

1138
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,420
of which you ever made will have input I

1139
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,500
think this is a good start we've been

1140
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,600
doing this for a very long time and

1141
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,190
realized taking legal actions is the

1142
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,960
only thing left to do we don't think

1143
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,360
there's like a lot for example net

1144
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,940
neutrality is it is important but at

1145
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,890
this point in time the stuff that we're

1146
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,810
doing if we separated the companies it

1147
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,759
would fix net neutrality because you can

1148
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,770
choose your own eyes

1149
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,470
you don't have to have picked this one

1150
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:57,009
you could say you know there were 331

1151
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:59,609
ISPs in New York City in 2001 when I

1152
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:02,350
looked on this uh and the board watch

1153
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,850
ISP directory so that's a lot of eyes

1154
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,440
peas so I think bringing a back

1155
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:09,580
competition I think they'll show up is

1156
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,170
an important step and so I think I think

1157
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,720
it's up to us basically to go out and

1158
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:17,740
start telling the stories you know any

1159
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,120
any help this is this is a great I want

1160
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,439
to thank the Internet Society for you

1161
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,540
know suggesting that I speak at this

1162
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:27,790
conference all right so I am actually

1163
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,490
assuming the FCC right now for data

1164
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,170
related to people who were asked Rove

1165
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,299
turfing the comment system during the

1166
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,940
restoring Internet freedom proceeding

1167
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,920
last year that ended net neutrality you

1168
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,150
had talked about astroturfing earlier I

1169
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,660
was wondering if you can name some names

1170
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:47,710
of not only front groups but groups that

1171
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,029
were funding the front groups well my

1172
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,640
favorite group is Alec the American

1173
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:54,280
Legislative Exchange Council which

1174
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,890
basically creates model legislation from

1175
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,200
the phone companies it puts it into that

1176
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,330
gives it to politicians who then go out

1177
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,379
and do it so this I divided up the world

1178
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,150
in a couple of different ways this

1179
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,680
politicians were just paid off like in

1180
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,330
California there's a bunch of people

1181
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,270
that got you know half a million dollars

1182
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,890
a million dollars from AT&T it's usually

1183
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:16,210
done in this Foundation grant money

1184
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:19,710
which most people don't know in in in I

1185
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:23,140
can make there's a list of about 50 so I

1186
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:26,890
let's start off with mm and TC I think

1187
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,500
it is the in DC that multi-camera than

1188
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:33,790
any of that one

1189
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:40,270
I'd have to miss too many I'm getting

1190
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:43,390
confused sorry uh yeah I heard about

1191
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,880
this we actually started outing them all

1192
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,680
about three years ago and they've all

1193
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,180
changed names that's why I was having

1194
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,589
trouble with the old ones there's one of

1195
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,020
those there was one group called issue

1196
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,660
dynamics in the history which basically

1197
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:59,559
had 15 or 17 groups working out of it

1198
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,700
own offices but in terms of the new

1199
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,039
groups there's a whole bunch of them

1200
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,589
though that I'd have to make a list

1201
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:09,400
input post it but thanks I should do

1202
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:11,770
that yeah if you're looking there

1203
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,309
anybody who's for for who's against net

1204
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,849
neutrality

1205
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:18,940
they're probably paid off or at least

1206
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:20,589
lots of it though hi so my question was

1207
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,329
about like companies like Facebook and

1208
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:24,308
SpaceX are trying to push toward like

1209
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:26,970
satellite internet do you think that's

1210
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:29,349
an actually possibility to shift the

1211
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,910
internet and the cable networks or is

1212
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:34,450
that just gonna be another character

1213
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,799
mistake like 5g is going I'd like to

1214
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:37,930
think it would go to work I was around

1215
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,880
for iridium which was the gungi the

1216
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,828
solution set for everybody's you know

1217
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,900
broadband and they was thing called CAI

1218
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:45,849
Wireless in 95 when the companies

1219
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,440
stopped pulling out of their wireless

1220
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:50,049
thing oh no we're gonna offer you know

1221
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,770
this other Wireless so I've seen this

1222
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:55,299
five or six times and so history says if

1223
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,700
I had to bet on it I would say it would

1224
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,960
be a good bet but considering there's a

1225
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,029
lot more people out in space than the

1226
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,400
word before you know there's a chance I

1227
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:06,160
don't see it happening so fast

1228
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,049
you know when AT&T bought DirecTV I was

1229
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,770
going oh no they're gonna really up

1230
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:14,288
on all broadband AT&T so AT&T you said

1231
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,609
it's gonna do fiber and the FCC and then

1232
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:17,770
I rolled out universe which is a copper

1233
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:19,598
to the home service and couldn't do the

1234
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:21,220
speeds and then basically it then it

1235
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,049
wants to shut off the copper because it

1236
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,209
wants to give you DIRECTV

1237
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:27,339
and the answer is is they just want to

1238
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,079
keep the standards so low that they can

1239
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,869
you know give you two cans and string I

1240
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,520
said well we're offering broadband I

1241
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:34,960
mean it's gotten to the point where I'll

1242
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,569
give the example the FCC is set the

1243
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,670
rural areas would be 10 down one up for

1244
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:41,440
wireless fixed wireless tech Majan I

1245
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:44,349
think that's why we have to show off the

1246
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,539
copper because DSL could give that speed

1247
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,339
but that would give you unlimited versus

1248
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:50,890
we'd have to go out and charge you per

1249
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:54,009
gig here I mean the trade-offs are

1250
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,569
ridiculous so I don't really if you had

1251
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:58,420
if I had to do a projection I would say

1252
00:49:55,569 --> 00:50:01,259
that the likelihood of satellite showing

1253
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,300
up and being ubiquitous and working

1254
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:07,260
not big in the next couple of years but

1255
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:09,300
you know so I love what you're doing and

1256
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,480
especially to call that same thing you

1257
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,480
said

1258
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,569
I can't see anybody but it sounds great

1259
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,538
[Applause]
