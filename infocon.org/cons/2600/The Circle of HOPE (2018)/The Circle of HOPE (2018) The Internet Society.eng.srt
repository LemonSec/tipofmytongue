1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
so uh and the lights are on so I can't

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,330
see any of you but I hope you're

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,950
settling down and before I start I just

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,250
want to say that you know I just caught

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,929
the end of what Chelsea was saying and

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,809
she talked about the quantum computing

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,400
and the dick and the encryption and

8
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:21,390
recently we did an event with Dave

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,788
father who Dave Farber who is the

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,220
grandfather of the Internet and he said

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,680
exactly the same thing that you know

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,990
without stronger encryption than we have

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,450
now everything's going to get screwed up

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,500
even blockchain or whatever it's only as

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:42,510
weak as the endpoints and so I echoed

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,579
what she says so my name is Joe Lee I'm

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,349
the president of the Internet Society of

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,750
New York I also do live streaming for

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,180
the internet society live streaming this

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,300
tonight and so the first thing I want to

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,660
say is to give out my thanks to the hope

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,120
knock to Hurricane electric who hooks up

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,419
I hope not to the Internet to the hope

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,408
AV team and the lighting team so that

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,580
without them as our co-workers we

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,040
wouldn't be able to put on this great

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,298
stream that people I hope are watching

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,950
all over the place and I know they are

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:22,320
in the mezzanine a big shout out to you

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:25,770
guys down in the mezzanine so so the

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,869
Internet Society was formed in 92 and it

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,670
was because the the National Science

33
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,350
Foundation that decided that they no

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,720
want no longer wanted to run the

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,369
backbone so it was handed off to the

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,090
backbone was handed off to commercial

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,770
providers and and the IETF needed a an

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,310
organizational home to run their

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,949
meetings and everything and so we're 25

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,200
years old and by coincidence 92 was also

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,579
the same year the e FF was formed so it

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,090
was a kind of significant year in

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,380
internet history Vint Cerf came up with

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,380
the phrase the internet is for everyone

45
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,979
and this is not an original idea for him

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,490
because even in the 80s he said I pee on

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,490
everything

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,509
but more complicatedly you know people

49
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,940
keep coming up to us downstairs and

50
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,579
saying what does the internet do

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,730
internet society do and so here's been

52
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,140
again saying we're trying to help all of

53
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,910
the stakeholders of the internet to

54
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,010
understand what the implications of the

55
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,530
technology are what policies are

56
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,120
beneficial and what rights and freedoms

57
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,790
need to be preserved in the use of this

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:36,070
system so then often says now he talks

59
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,100
about the internet or whatever replaces

60
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,780
it and you know the father of any child

61
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,370
knows how fragile its offspring is and

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,990
and I just you know recently been

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,720
talking to him and he still sort of come

64
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,240
back to this thing that he he's still

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,100
looking for something that's better than

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,780
the internet that might come on but at

67
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,070
the moment the internet society's

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,750
mission is to like hook everybody up

69
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,340
we were prevent this year and we've got

70
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,250
a project for the local chapter within

71
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,530
which is digital preservation and this

72
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,370
is something which doesn't get the kind

73
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,110
of attention that it might do that the

74
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,360
the reality that we're in right now of

75
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,540
with everything online is a lot of it is

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,290
ephemeral and so how it's been preserved

77
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,000
and conserved is an important thing

78
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,500
we've done some events already an event

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,660
I would like to do and I hope to do

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,400
later in the year is to get Vint and

81
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,400
Jason Scott in the same room

82
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,620
so yeah I'm Vince still is into

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,600
protocols and so this is something he

84
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:46,810
tweeted just yesterday a simple

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:49,530
flowchart getting back to the Internet

86
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,000
Society this is a simpler formulation

87
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,610
working for an Internet as open globally

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,320
connected and secure and so we've got a

89
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,090
bunch of key issues that we're working

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,799
on at the moment so the first one is

91
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,390
community networks and this is really a

92
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,340
big thing where we're looking at

93
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,540
we've got 3.5 billion people on the

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,030
internet we want to put another three

95
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,700
point there's another 3.5 to come on and

96
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,500
so the only way to do it is basically

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,268
for them to like hook themselves up

98
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,609
rather than waiting for the internet to

99
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,940
come to them so the last mile becomes

100
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,700
the first mile and so on

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,860
here in New York we're kind of leading

102
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,630
the way with the NYC mesh but this is a

103
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,520
picture of a bunch of guys in Georgia

104
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:31,400
sticking up a an antenna on a on a on a

105
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,289
mountaintop the next one that we're

106
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,989
looking at our key issue is Internet

107
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,730
Governance and so we're pushing the

108
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,220
multi-stakeholder model you know and

109
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,230
this is as an alternative to like being

110
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,100
run just by governments and industry the

111
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:49,550
multilateral model which so you know for

112
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,140
to promote multistakeholderism the third

113
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,900
one is the Internet of Things it's the

114
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,750
security of the Internet of Things the

115
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,880
fact that you know you you have all

116
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,520
these devices being cranked out that

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,540
don't have any any security in them they

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,210
aren't updatable online so trying to

119
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,920
figure out you know standards and doing

120
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,229
that in a multi-stakeholder fashion

121
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,760
we've got several processes going on

122
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,220
around the world to like establish

123
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,039
standards on that kind of thing and the

124
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,930
last one is routing security mutually

125
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,820
agreed nor the routing security so this

126
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,260
is kind of avoiding that I don't if you

127
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,570
remember a couple of a few years ago

128
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,230
when Pakistan hijacked the entire

129
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,870
YouTube traffic so this kind of thing

130
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,310
where people know who they're reaching

131
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,090
and the methods by which they're

132
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,400
reaching them the people can't poof on

133
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,849
BGP where the parent organization the

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,750
internet Engineering Task Force and so

135
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:50,810
in 92 the David Clarke articulated the

136
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,940
internet Creed Reva jet Kings presidents

137
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,130
and voting we believe in running code

138
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,300
and rough consensus and this is still

139
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,740
the way that the IETF runs but there was

140
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,600
a little that's well known but a little

141
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,660
less well known as these things that he

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,730
also said at the same time our best

143
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,730
success was not computing but hooking

144
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,290
people together the hacks of today are

145
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,360
the commonplace of tomorrow

146
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,370
the problem is assigning the correct

147
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,350
degree of fear to distant elephants and

148
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,680
that's what Chelsea was doing right

149
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:25,780
there if we have a problem it is due to

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:31,220
too much success that's for sure I

151
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:33,229
recommend reading the tower of the ITF

152
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,570
the internet society is financed by

153
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:38,810
dot-org we all the money that goes to

154
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,520
dog when you get a dog thing comes after

155
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,139
administration comes to us and that's

156
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,549
what pays for you is paying for your

157
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:49,699
streaming today ipv6 we launched it

158
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,509
properly in June June 6 2012 so we've

159
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:55,820
now just gone over 6 years 7 is the 7

160
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,070
year stretch coming next year we're

161
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,419
gonna try and make sure that we're just

162
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,520
getting into a point where suddenly

163
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,090
it'll become it will become the new

164
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,280
normal which is we more than it was then

165
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,630
I want to mention the internet Hall of

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,210
Fame this is a great thing that the

167
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,719
Internet Society does which not only

168
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,250
honest people that did stuff but also

169
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,900
you know if you if you go in there and

170
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,400
read through it it's better than reading

171
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,870
a history of the Internet to like look

172
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,760
at these people those videos of these

173
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,570
people this guy I want to mention this

174
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,190
Allen integer who's from Barbados where

175
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,409
in fact invented the first search engine

176
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,580
Archie I'm sure you old-school guys

177
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,669
remember Archie

178
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,080
so and he's a good example of a guy who

179
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,280
didn't you know someone said to him well

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
you could make some money off this he

181
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,580
said I don't want to make money I just

182
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,099
want people to be able to do it you know

183
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,080
if you read up about Larry and Sergey

184
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,460
that was their same idea at the

185
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,599
beginning they didn't want to make money

186
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,969
out of it they just thought it was like

187
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:56,210
you know they wanted to help people but

188
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:58,490
they got waylaid this is also on the

189
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,440
Internet Hall of Fame there's a very

190
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,210
good timeline of the internet it's well

191
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,139
worth reading getting back to the

192
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,299
Internet Society

193
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,010
we've got chapters all over the world

194
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,659
this is an old map we've got more

195
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,300
chapters than this

196
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:14,180
and we're a broad tent we have big

197
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,310
organizations you know Microsoft and and

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,729
people like that as well as you know

199
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,380
people like me we have a bunch of

200
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,030
special interest groups blockchain

201
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,630
community network cyber security

202
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,888
internet of food Internet of Things

203
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,139
interplanetary networking chapter which

204
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:33,529
is Vince as well delay-tolerant

205
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,089
networking the women special interest

206
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,830
group the youth special interest group

207

which is a spanish-speaking group and

208
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,610
one that I'm involved in which is an

209
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,610
accessibility special interest group

210
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,760
so we going back to community networking

211
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,280
what we had the Internet Society New

212
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,730
York have come to an arrangement with my

213
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,990
see mesh and in fact this was born out

214
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:59,990
of the last hope when we first shared it

215
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,460
shared our table with them and and that

216
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,160
was really what got them off the ground

217
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,000
at that time they had 40 nodes local

218
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,050
nodes now they have a hundred and

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,540
eighty-three nodes

220
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,030
since that and this is by the help of

221
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,599
engineers that were recruited here here

222
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,060
at Hope know to no good unless people

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,450
are hooked together and so there's a map

224
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,430
of the actual links between the modes so

225
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,050
the way that NYC mesh works is you know

226
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,630
you get the router you get the router on

227
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,520
your roof you have to pay for the

228
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,860
hardware to get it installed it's like a

229
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,020
hundred and something bucks and then you

230
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,200
basically make a donation of 20 bucks or

231
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,970
months to two and that's what you do

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,620
and that comes to us as the Internet

233
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,830
Society in New York where this fiscal

234
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,520
sponsor we're a 501 C 3 so you can

235
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,720
actually you know that's tax-deductible

236
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,640
donation at the end of the year for you

237
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,120
so you can take the internet off your

238
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,760
tax and and it's working well that's a

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,560
super node on top of the on top of the

240
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,340
savvy building the old Verizon building

241
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,069
downtown there's another super node in

242
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:10,850
in bed-stuy that one you can see there

243
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,460
and we're always looking for tall

244
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:17,540
buildings that we can get on the top of

245
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:21,680
with that so it's something to do so

246
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,230
we're actually taking donations for NYC

247
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,699
mesh downstairs and if you donate ten

248
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,490
bucks you can get one of these t-shirts

249
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,000
but you better hurry up because we're

250
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,380
going to run out of them today and just

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,270
a little more about the internet start

252
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,040
in New York I'd like to compliment one

253
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,010
of our board members Avril Doria who is

254
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,420
now a director of ICANN she spoke this

255
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,970
morning at nine o'clock I don't know if

256
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,349
you saw her and and then someone else

257
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,020
that we've actually got on our board

258
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,860
this year we've got a new guy this guy

259
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:54,740
Alexander Jay Ovilus

260
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,720
so we're you know won't be long before

261
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,070
he replaces me as president probably but

262
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,270
he's certainly going to replace me here

263
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,270
on stage right now

264
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:08,539
[Applause]
