1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,910
okay hi everybody um my name is Michael

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,759
E as as part of my job as a journalist I

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,710
have to accept all documents from

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,900
strangers that are untrusted and open

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,500
them to see what's in them all the time

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,920
and you know cubes makes this job much

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,220
easier along with a lot of other parts

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:32,308
of my job and I'm gonna go into exactly

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,839
how so cubes is an operating system but

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,059
it's kind of fundamentally different

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,280
than the operating system most of us are

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,199
familiar with like Windows or Mac OS or

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:48,690
Debian or fedora or a bun - in cubes you

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,280
have this thin layer called Dom zero it

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,230
runs a hypervisor called Zen and

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,170
basically everything else is around

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:00,209
inside of virtual machines the virtual

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,760
machines they provide isolation and they

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,690
can do a lot of cool things and so

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,339
different virtual machines are called

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,979
different security domains so for

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,770
example you could have a virtual machine

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,470
that is very untrustworthy and you use

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,449
this to open up like a sketchy PDF or

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,610
you could have a very like trusted

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,990
virtual machine that doesn't have any

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,030
network access and you keep your

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,740
password database in there and there's

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,030
disposable virtual machines and all

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,589
sorts of other stuff that I'm gonna go

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,970
and do so before I could jump in I'm

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,710
gonna show you oh and the reason why

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,270
it's not all the way full screen is

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,289
because I can only see this much on my

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,090
screen I don't think that it's gioves

36
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:46,470
fault I think that it's the displays

37
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:51,299
fault anyways okay so I'm gonna show you

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,149
the cube manager this is a list of all

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,310
of the virtual machines that are on my

40
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,579
computer these like little green circles

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,369
means it's powered on right now so you

42
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,589
have template beams and so in my case

43
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,840
these are my template VMs there's debian

44
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,090
fedora and then whoo next vm's which are

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,700
tor beams which I'm going to go into

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,800
more

47
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,190
then you have a PM so a PM's are based

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,680
on template vm's so the idea is that

49
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,300
like for example your email VM will be

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
an app VM and it has its own home

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,970
directory so it has its own like private

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,820
storage but it shares the same root

53
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,140
filesystem with your template so if you

54
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,150
wanted to like install a new piece of

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,470
software in one of your app VMs you

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,710
actually install that software on your

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,609
template VM and when you and so you know

58
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,020
if I update my Fedora 28 template then I

59
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,570
update the software in all of these

60
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,340
idioms that are based on fedora 28 and

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,579
then there's also standalone vm's and so

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,930
these are basically like a PM's except

63
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,100
they have their own root storage and so

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,590
they're super useful if you're gonna

65
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,450
make a domain that you want to just

66
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,010
install a random stuff in so like if

67
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,420
you're playing capture the flag you want

68
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,190
to install a bunch of hacking tools

69
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,149
you want to run weird binaries you don't

70
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,910
want to mess up anything else in your

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,760
system using a standalone VM is great

72
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,040
for that and it also supports Windows

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,720
and installing you know arbitrary

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,220
operating systems from is OS and I'll

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,190
talk a little bit about that time okay

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,680
so to start I'm gonna show you about

77
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:30,270
window decorations so let's go ahead and

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,280
open files in my personal VM and it

79
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,190
takes a second to open because you'll

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,820
see it pops up a thing in the corner a

81
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,700
notification and it's booting up a VM

82
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:47,970
right now then that's also open files in

83
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:49,170
my work VM so the personal VM is open so

84
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,180
the first thing you'll notice is that

85
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,260
the window decorations are different

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:00,120
that my files VM is has yellow windows

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,130
and my work VM is about to pop up and it

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,160
also says personal so you can see what

89
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:10,019
domain you're currently looking out make

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,200
sure

91
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,299
okay and so my work VM is blue and it

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,279
says work and so the window decorations

93
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:23,080
are part of dom0 actually so my super

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,419
trusted domain with the one that's

95
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,919
running my window manager controls the

96
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,470
window decorations so it's impossible

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,690
for like my work VM to open a window

98
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,430
that looks like my personal VM it always

99
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,320
has to have these this blue window

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,820
decorations so I'm gonna go ahead and

101
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,730
show you how moving files around works

102
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,099
so let's go into a different folder you

103
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,770
could just drag files like normal if

104
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,070
it's part of the same domain so you

105
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,930
could drag files from work to work but

106
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,120
you can't drag files from work to

107
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,440
personal and these are different virtual

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,600
machines there's no way for them to

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,040
communicate between each other on their

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,570
own but if you really want to copy a

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,120
file between them what you can do is

112
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,020
right-click on a file and copy to other

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,680
app VM so now it pops up a window and 0

114
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,919
asking for my permission and I tell it

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,720
what VM I want and now I have a cubes

116
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,460
incoming folder it's work and I've

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,290
copied the file so you can totally copy

118
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,919
files between bm's and it's not a

119
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:30,640
problem but you need to the user needs

120
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,630
to give like explicit consent so malware

121
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,640
can't do that for you

122
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,460
so I'm gonna open up a couple of text

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,120
files and show you how copying and

124
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:44,950
pasting works so let's go ahead select

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,990
this and copy it so I can just right

126
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,940
click and paste but then if I come over

127
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,930
here right click there's nothing on the

128
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,070
clipboard over here because again

129
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,810
they're different virtual machines so

130
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,460
they have different clip words so if I

131
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,300
want to actually copy and paste between

132
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,150
virtual machines let's copy so what I do

133
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,060
is I have this window highlighted and

134
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,710
then I press control shift C and so what

135
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,780
it just did is it took whatever was in

136
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,419
my work VMs clipboard and copied it to a

137
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,219
global cubes clipboard then I selected

138
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,409
this window and press control shift V

139
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,300
and it took what was in the global cubes

140
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,640
clipboard and piece and copied it into

141
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,050
the personal clipboard and now I can

142
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
right click and paste and you can copy

143
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,110
between VMs so it's basically like if

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,840
you want to

145
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,550
break the isolation by moving files or

146
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,619
by copying and pasting you can totally

147
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:37,620
do it you just just dom0 needs to give

148
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:40,120
explicit consent um alright

149
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:44,550
disposable VMS for web browsing so this

150
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,200
is um pretty much okay so fedora 28 DBM

151
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,610
Google Chrome what I'm doing is I'm

152
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,020
opening up a disposal VM and this is

153
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,150
pretty much how I do almost all of my

154
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,620
web browser I have a couple of VMs where

155
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:59,289
I have some stuff stored in my browser

156
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,270
but for the most part it's um all

157
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,540
disposable so what this means is that

158
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,370
there was a brick cubes just created a

159
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,730
new VM it's called disk with a random

160
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:14,290
number at the end powered on the VM

161
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,520
opened up Chrome and now boom I just

162
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,800
have a web browser I could do whatever I

163
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,229
want I can like go to sketchy websites

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,140
get malware on my computer whatever and

165
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,300
then as soon as I click this X the VM

166
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,479
gets deleted and destroyed and it

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,130
doesn't ever existed and so it's pretty

168
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,280
awesome and disposable yawns can be used

169
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,740
for plenty of cool things other than

170
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,250
just having you know very private

171
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,120
private browser mode so for example I

172
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,640
have this set of sketchy documents so

173
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,640
hacking team is an Italian surveillance

174
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:53,620
company they their customers are

175
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,010
governments and law enforcement and a

176
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,130
lot of the government customers are

177
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,560
pretty repressive and have used their

178
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,000
products and services to hack activists

179
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,590
and things like that a few years ago

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,900
they got hacked all of their email got

181
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,849
dumped on the Internet this these are

182
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,250
some random attachments from their email

183
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,710
and their email attachment attachments

184
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,450
include like live malware because their

185
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,099
customers would just send an email to

186
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,380
hacking team being like here's a bait

187
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,040
document it's like a you know docx Word

188
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,630
document

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,650
can you please add your malware to it

190
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,030
and then they would add malware and

191
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,989
reply and they're like here you go

192
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:32,329
send your phishing email so exploit docx

193
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,599
for example you could right-click on it

194
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,610
and view and disposable BAM so this

195
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,860
creates a brand new virtual machine

196
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,560
copies this document to the virtual

197
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,779
machine and then opens it and then as

198
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,729
soon as that process in this case it's a

199
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,600
docx oh the LibreOffice process closes

200
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,370
via virtual machine gets destroyed so in

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,560
this case this wasn't actually I don't

202
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,459
think I mean I didn't like do forensics

203
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,689
on it but I don't think that this

204
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,589
actually was malware I think this is

205
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,910
just a Word document

206
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,470
with emails copied and pasted in it but

207
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,689
if it was malware and if it did actually

208
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,370
exploit Libre Office and a hack this

209
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,740
computer it wouldn't matter because it

210
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,320
would just be hacking this to to to H

211
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,250
and disposition wait doesn't have any

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,920
private data in it at all and then as

213
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,339
soon as I click the X it the VM gets

214
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,769
destroyed so another really cool thing

215
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,860
that cubes supports is things called

216
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,269
trusted PDFs it only works with PDFs at

217
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,660
the moment there's not like a similar

218
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,120
thing for office documents but um like

219
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,770
here's a PDF so let's go ahead and

220
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,920
right-click and convert to trusted PDF

221
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:45,290
so what this is doing is let's say I

222
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,910
have this PDF and I don't trust it I

223
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,890
don't think that I think it might be

224
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,779
malicious I don't know but I want to

225
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,160
send it to like a colleague and they're

226
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,390
not using cubes so they can't just open

227
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,219
it into suppose Le'Veon but I want to

228
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,020
make it safe for them when I do this

229
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,810
what I do is cubes creates a new

230
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,240
disposable VM copies the PDF into the VM

231
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,279
and then basically like flattens it and

232
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,680
turns it into a giant list of pixels and

233
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,510
returns the pixel data and then my work

234
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,479
VM that started this takes the pixels

235
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,390
and turns it into a PDF so basically it

236
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,360
removes any possibility of malware being

237
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:21,500
in the final document and now I have the

238
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:25,820
same PDF except trusted PDF and I can

239
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,709
look at it so this PDF is now completely

240
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,019
safe for me to like open it and my

241
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,430
normal vm's not just billable VMs or

242
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,779
send it to people that I work with and

243
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,290
they can open it and it's not gonna hack

244
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,899
them a couple things about trusted PDFs

245
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,370
is because there it's just pixel data

246
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,630
and it's all flat and it removes the

247
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,700
text data so you can't actually select

248
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:48,720
text anymore and then also

249
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,520
if you go I created this cubes untrusted

250
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,080
PDF folder here's the original the

251
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,630
original is six point three megabytes

252
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,550
and trusted is nine megabytes so it

253
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,080
makes the file size bigger but it's

254
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,849
super worth it because you could take

255
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,320
random PDFs that you don't trust that

256
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,420
might have malware and make them safe to

257
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:09,180
view before you view them but before you

258
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:11,790
share them okay so a really cool thing

259
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,180
about cubes is vault and in fact this

260
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,980
PDF for the slides is inside of a vault

261
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,650
vaults are just VMs that don't have

262
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,020
network access and by not having network

263
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,300
access here let me actually open a

264
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,920
terminal in this vault it just doesn't

265
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,120
have an Ethernet device there's just no

266
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:34,430
way to make network connections from

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:37,350
these beams so open files

268
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,670
alright so vaults are great for a couple

269
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,790
of things they're good for password

270
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:45,510
databases they're good for sensitive

271
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,130
documents that you want to keep safe so

272
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,800
that if one part of your computer gets

273
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,260
hacked you keep the documents way safer

274
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,060
so like if I were you know using

275
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,819
Thunderbird and someone uses sends me an

276
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,650
email that exploits thunderbird you know

277
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,440
my leach documents are still safe that

278
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,860
the hacker doesn't have access to it and

279
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,840
also here's just a cool thing so said

280
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,220
today is a section of the snowden

281
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,530
archive that we've been publishing

282
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,510
systematically it's from the signals

283
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,209
intelligence Directorate and let me just

284
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,090
open one of these documents that we

285
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:22,050
published in a disposable VM I actually

286
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:23,850
set it up so that the vault VM when it

287
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,969
opens disposable vans uses a different

288
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,890
disposable VM template so it opens mult

289
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,440
disposable VMS so there's different

290
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:36,000
types of disposable VMS so for example

291
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,710
this document right now is inside of a

292
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,910
vault but it's still a disposable OPM

293
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:45,990
and let me if this look over here okay

294
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,870
so so clicking this shows all of the

295
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,160
active VMS and here's a disposable

296
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,529
here's of the disposable van so let's

297
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,939
run it terminal in it

298
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:58,670
and like you know it's a vault so if I

299
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:00,589
try and open you know some sort of

300
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,180
malware that wants to phone home it just

301
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,160
won't be able to it doesn't have any way

302
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,160
to exit rate anything from my computer

303
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:22,999
okay so let's open Thunderbird in my

304
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:24,949
email VM so cubes comes with a

305
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,660
Thunderbird add-on that is pretty cool

306
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:29,779
which I will show you in a second but

307
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:34,189
basically you can set it to just open

308
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:35,689
all of your emails and or open all of

309
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:43,910
your email attachments and disposable

310
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:45,829
beings so tools add-ons cubes

311
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,620
attachments here I can't see the side of

312
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,819
the screen preferences so you could just

313
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,959
go in and check this box and so by

314
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,769
default whenever you click on an

315
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,309
attachment it opens in a disposable view

316
00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:02,449
so for example I'm going to tell a brief

317
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:06,199
story there's this American election

318
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:08,569
vendor called VR systems a team of

319
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,758
Russian hackers working for GRU hacked

320
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,529
this company and got access to their

321
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,180
customer list and then they sent spear

322
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,709
phishing emails to their customer lists

323
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,258
which include local election officials

324
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:20,000
in North Carolina and Virginia and

325
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,949
Florida and in lots of other places and

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,470
all of these local election officials

327
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,699
received an email just like this and we

328
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,839
actually know exactly what the email

329
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:32,300
looks like from FOIA requests because we

330
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,889
void their email for beer for like VR

331
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,469
systems and so it looked just like this

332
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,990
it included an attachment that look that

333
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,939
looks just like this that had this file

334
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,170
name but it was malware and if you open

335
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,329
it in Microsoft Word

336
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,069
it would have hacked their computer

337
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:49,040
installed some sort of like remote

338
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:51,519
access tool for the GRU to access it and

339
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,449
then we don't know if anyone actually

340
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,459
clicked on it and got hacked it's

341
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:58,309
possible they did we haven't seen

342
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,109
evidence of it but if they did then you

343
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:02,209
know the hacker would have access to

344
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,570
everything on their computer like all

345
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,949
their email and now

346
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,110
thing that their computer has access to

347
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,880
so like they're connected to some sort

348
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,470
of electoral system VPN with a whole

349
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,680
network the attacker would have access

350
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,800
to that too but if they were using cubes

351
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,630
they could just click on it wait did

352
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,449
they click on it yeah I clicked on it

353
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,490
and it would just open a disposable VM

354
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,290
and then even if it did actually exploit

355
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,390
it like include an exploit that works

356
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,849
for Libre Office in this case and

357
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,830
actually hack it it would be fine

358
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,710
because there's no data in this VM and

359
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:38,130
then as soon as you close this VM it

360
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:40,440
gets destroyed so this I feel like is

361
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,450
one of the like best features of cubes

362
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,010
is it solves like half of the phishing

363
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,540
problem there's like the other half of

364
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,990
the phishing problem is like credential

365
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,780
storage or I mean credential stealing it

366
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,410
doesn't quite solve out oh yeah so here

367
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:58,050
is an encrypted message and so in this

368
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,730
case it's taking a second because my

369
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,359
secret key is actually stored in this

370
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,170
other vault

371
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,170
it's called GP GBM so I actually don't

372
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,670
have my secret keys in my email VM I

373
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,150
have secret keys in a vault that doesn't

374
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:14,910
have access to the Internet and so my GP

375
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,850
GBM is asking if I want to get allow the

376
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,520
email VM to access my keys and so I can

377
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,470
say yes and now the GPG VM is where I

378
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,050
type my password so even if I have

379
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,780
malware in my email VM that's spying on

380
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,819
all of my email it still doesn't it

381
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,540
doesn't have the capability to be to

382
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:36,150
steal my secret key it could use my

383
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,589
secret key to decrypt messages but it'll

384
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,560
but you know because I gave it

385
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:43,170
permission for 300 seconds but it pops

386
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,579
up a notification when it does up and

387
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:51,329
here let me see let me open a password

388
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:55,170
database here's my PGP passphrase so

389
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:00,980
let's go ahead and copy the password and

390
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:05,129
then ctrl shift C ctrl shift V and then

391
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:12,260
paste the password and it d-cups the

392
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:17,760
email so that's pretty cool

393
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,960
okay so porcupine is a sort of a web

394
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,790
browser it's a little bit it's not

395
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,310
really a web browser it's a piece of

396
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,260
software that I wrote it's packaged

397
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,089
Nymphadora so you can like just to

398
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,000
install it in your Fedora template if

399
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,389
you want what it does is here let me

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,100
show you

401
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:37,530
let's open porcupine in my email VM so

402
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,659
basically you set it as your web browser

403
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,160
and whenever you click a link it just

404
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,600
copies that link to your clipboard and

405
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,190
shows you a notification of what link

406
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,230
you clicked or if you wanted to you can

407
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,870
choose it to run a command so for

408
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,490
example if you're on qvm open in DVM you

409
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,689
could just make it so that by default

410
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,470
when you click links it opens on my

411
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,750
disposable Beyonc

412
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,530
but i'm gonna keep it as copying it to

413
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,660
the clipboard so this way

414
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,399
you know maybe sometimes you get a link

415
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,840
and you really want to click it but

416
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,320
you're sketched out because maybe it's a

417
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,659
sketchy link so here let me go ahead and

418
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,030
open up with Firefox in a disposable VM

419
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:18,390
for a second and show you how porcupine

420
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:21,090
works and this looks like a sketchy link

421
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,840
but I'm so curious and I trust this mica

422
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,199
lead guy but he sent me a sketchy link I

423
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,580
don't know so I click it and it just

424
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,050
pops up a notification telling me the

425
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,020
link that I clicked and then I can press

426
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:38,899
ctrl shift C switch over to here ctrl

427
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,900
shift V and then wait

428
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:49,560
and then paste the link and it turns out

429
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,550
it is kind of a sketchy link but it's

430
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,159
like a different type of sketchy this is

431
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,730
an article that I wrote about how to run

432
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,890
an anonymous Twitter account and in fact

433
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,690
in the article you need to do a lot of

434
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,770
stuff over tor anonymously and so

435
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,200
there's a lot of doing stuff in in cubes

436
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:18,810
UNIX VMs which I'm gonna get into in a

437
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:20,970
bit okay signal is an awesome app it

438
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,980
makes it so that it's easy to send and

439
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,630
encrypted messages but it has a couple

440
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,130
of problems I'm one of those problems is

441
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,720
that what signal your username is your

442
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,790
phone number so if you want to be able

443
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,140
to let people send you messages you need

444
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,730
to share your phone number with them and

445
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,100
a lot of people especially like public

446
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,290
figures or journalists like have you

447
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,120
know real legit reasons to not share

448
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,700
their phone number with strangers so one

449
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,530
of the great things about cubes is that

450
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,690
you have as many signals as you want you

451
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,760
just run them in different app phones so

452
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,210
let's go ahead and open a couple of

453
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,870
signal desktops so there's actually what

454
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,460
I do myself I have a you know the signal

455
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,439
that's on my phone and I have a signal

456
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,880
private VM with signal desktop and then

457
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,680
I have a different signal that's

458
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,860
connected to like a Google Voice number

459
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,210
but you can use to look like these VMs

460
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,590
that are opening now or connected to

461
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,250
Twilio numbers there's lots of different

462
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,689
ways of getting phone numbers and you

463
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,820
could just have multiple signals running

464
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,380
and I just have them both up and so you

465
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,060
know strangers will send messages to

466
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,280
signal public the people I know son

467
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:28,620
message is a signal private and so you

468
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,330
know I just have signal desktop and it's

469
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,000
like it's like trivial to just have as

470
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,590
many compartmentalize signal desktops or

471
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,660
any other software like this where like

472
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,520
normally you know it expects you to only

473
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,790
be running one you just make multiple

474
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,790
beams

475
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,870
okay so um you can run windows and cubes

476
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,520
it doesn't have the best windows support

477
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,530
though it basically if you use Windows 7

478
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,139
you can install windows tools which

479
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,240
basically allows you to do like the

480
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,730
shared clipboard thing and copy files

481
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,530
into and out of the the VM

482
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,360
but even that it doesn't let you like

483
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,370
like audio doesn't work in Windows and

484
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,139
stuff and also Windows 7 is like

485
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,830
terribly old and if you're gonna be

486
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,740
using windows use Windows 10 and it work

487
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,689
Windows 10 works too but it'll just be

488
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,130
like in a in a window and they'll be

489
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,260
kind of hard to get data and into and

490
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,720
out of it but it works and so if you

491
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,129
like need to use Windows you can use it

492
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Kali Linux works as well but what I

493
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,470
actually recommend here I have a Kelly

494
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:35,520
VM on here is don't install Kali itself

495
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:37,830
instead make like a standalone VM or

496
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,810
make a new template VM based on Debian

497
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,580
and then just add the Kali repositories

498
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,340
to this VM and then you can just install

499
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,740
whatever kali software you need but you

500
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,020
get the nice like cubes interface where

501
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,220
you can move data into and out of it and

502
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,260
you have nice windows and window

503
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:57,390
decorations so this is this is a little

504
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,950
project that you know it's not actually

505
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,500
necessary but it's just a little tool

506
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,140
that makes it easy to add Kelly

507
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:10,350
repositories to any debian like

508
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:13,050
distribution and so you know it's um and

509
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,090
so you know I've installed some of the

510
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:22,370
Kali tools in here so I could just go

511
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:22,370
ahead and do like WP scan my website

512
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:32,090
I have a typo and now I'm scanning my

513
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,860
website for like what WordPress plugins

514
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,370
I have in what vulnerabilities there are

515
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,530
and things like that and so everything

516
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,120
just works as expected you just need to

517
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,290
like be familiar with the tools in

518
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,879
Keller that you want to use because you

519
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:52,610
don't have the nice menu and there's no

520
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:53,750
vulnerabilities with my website so I'm

521
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,030
sure there's all their abilities on my

522
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,630
website

523
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:03,670
okay so USB pass-through actually is it

524
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,670
finding anything okay no nothing nothing

525
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,180
[Music]

526
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:15,530
okay so in cubes you have this VM cold

527
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:24,950
six USB if you look at it up there I'm

528
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:29,000
gonna open it it's just USB okay sorry

529
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:33,130
oh my six USB was not open its booting

530
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,890
it up again so normally on a computer

531
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,210
okay so a big difference between cubes

532
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:42,830
between cubes and other computers is

533
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:45,110
that in most computers you run

534
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,240
everything in dom0 basically so if

535
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,370
anything gets hacked then they then your

536
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,080
dom0 is compromised in cubes you have

537
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,330
all of these different compartmentalize

538
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,470
compartmentalized things so since USB

539
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:00,800
has access to all of my USB devices so

540
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,170
and then here and actually dom0 here's

541
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:08,419
the dom0 terminal doesn't have any USB

542
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:11,560
devices and also like let's open I don't

543
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,940
know like my work terminal of my work VM

544
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:18,679
oops

545
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:21,140
LS USB yeah so in cubes all your USB

546
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,270
devices go to so cos B and if you want

547
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,500
to be able to use your USB devices in

548
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,900
other vm's you have to like give

549
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,310
explicit consent and you do this by

550
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,200
clicking on this little devices

551
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,350
drop-down and it shows a list of all the

552
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,700
devices and so and also your webcam is a

553
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,250
device

554
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,590
a USB device because in laptops normally

555
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,270
webcams are actually physically

556
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,560
connected to a USB controller or not a

557
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:49,040
PCI controller so I'm gonna show a quick

558
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:59,270
example let's go ahead and open Chrome

559
00:24:49,040 --> 00:25:04,340
and a disposable VM I'm gonna log in to

560
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:05,570
a Google account with a hole FD as my

561
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:15,310
password manager in the copy/paste

562
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:24,340
Softail okay so let's go to Google

563
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:30,860
sign-in let's copy username ctrl shift C

564
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:35,740
ctrl shift of the date paste copy the

565
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:42,320
password ctrl shift C ctrl shift V and

566
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:43,400
paste the password great and I have you

567
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,700
to F so I have two-step verification

568
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,140
turned on so here's my you Biki and I'm

569
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,880
gonna plug you the key in and I got a

570
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:58,780
notification that I plug the Yubikey and

571
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:02,420
hits a few s B and so this USB Yubikey

572
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:05,810
attach it to my disposable VM and then

573
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,880
press the button and it logs on so USB

574
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,040
devices work like that you can just

575
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,550
attach them to something and then and

576
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:20,020
then they work and so another example is

577
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:28,070
videoconferencing so let's go ahead and

578
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:31,900
Boop's attach my webcam to this

579
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:35,000
disposable VM and attach my microphone

580
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,470
to this disposable VM and so this is

581
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,480
actually an important thing by default

582
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,520
VMs don't have any access to your

583
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,590
microphone so if you have malware

584
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,629
running on anything it can't record the

585
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,189
ambient audio in the room you can't get

586
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,410
spied on that way unless you explicitly

587
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,300
give a VM permission to

588
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:55,030
Corder audio and the same with your

589
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:59,810
microphone so let's go to gypsy meets

590
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:01,310
start a new a new session and then we're

591
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,629
in the state for up giving my web

592
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:08,740
browser permission oh I have it covered

593
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:13,430
and yeah I still cover your webcam

594
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:15,260
obviously and there you go

595
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,610
the videoconferencing works pretty well

596
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,770
like the downside is the

597
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,209
videoconferencing only works as well as

598
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,240
it works um Linux so if you're using

599
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,310
some proprietary system like I've had

600
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,410
like terrible problems of the video and

601
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,210
other stuff it's not gonna work very

602
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:34,910
well but like jitsi me Google Hangouts

603
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:39,710
stuff like that will work fine okay so

604
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:42,890
other USB devices I've got one of these

605
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:47,150
it's a alpha Wi-Fi hacking thing and I

606
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:49,160
just wanted to quickly demo you can

607
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:54,260
still totally use cubes for all of your

608
00:27:49,160 --> 00:28:00,550
hacking that you want to do so let's go

609
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,550
ahead and open another terminal and Kali

610
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:21,760
for some reason this is the name of the

611
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:28,640
Alpha device is this Kelly cool OS USB

612
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:33,230
great I've got it so like let's yeah

613
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:40,510
so this is the device name let's put it

614
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:45,799
in monitor mode great monitor mode and

615
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:48,770
then like airodump-ng on channel 6 I'm

616
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,210
not saving these packets to a file but

617
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,158
it would be easy to okay so here's all

618
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,220
of the Wi-Fi networks we see here's like

619
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,230
you know data I guess this one a lot of

620
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,669
wait where did it go this one the open

621
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,700
network has a lot of packets running

622
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:03,799
through it right now and these are all

623
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,650
clients connected to Wi-Fi so anyway you

624
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,389
could totally just do whatever like USB

625
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,010
accessories you want and it works pretty

626
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,070
well in cubes the only exception really

627
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:14,960
actually is um if you're trying to do

628
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,289
android hacking and you're like flashing

629
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,960
new firmware to like new roms to Android

630
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:23,090
phones the active like the phone

631
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,220
rebooting kind of disconnects the USB

632
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,658
and breaks the pass through and there's

633
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,900
ways around it you just need to like do

634
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:31,280
it in your USB VM or attach your USB

635
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:37,850
controllers to a different VM but that's

636
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:41,809
kind of more advanced um okay USB

637
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:44,870
keywords alright so by default cubes

638
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:47,570
have disabled USB keyboards and most

639
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,520
laptops the keyboards built into your

640
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,500
laptop and also the track pad aren't USB

641
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,000
devices they're ps2 devices so they're

642
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,250
not actually connected to your USB

643
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,659
controllers and so the reason why cubes

644
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,909
disable that by default is because you

645
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:02,510
keyboards are a very big security

646
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:05,720
problem and this USB has access to all

647
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:08,210
of your USB devices and because USB is

648
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,010
like an attack vector it's totally

649
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,210
possible and so if USB is the vault it

650
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,350
doesn't have internet access but it's

651
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,450
still possible that if you plug in a

652
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,490
malicious USB device it could hack that

653
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,110
domain and if there's now we're running

654
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,080
in it it could like log your keystrokes

655
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,330
through your USB keyboard but if you

656
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,178
really want to use a USB keyboard you

657
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,129
can

658
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,230
you can change the setting and enable it

659
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:31,199
but what's cool is that you can make it

660
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,389
actually ask so make it prompt you and

661
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,990
dom0 if you want to trust this keyboard

662
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:40,110
or not

663
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:42,629
so um okay so I found this USB stick

664
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:47,899
outside on the sidewalk and I'm really

665
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:50,820
curious about what's in it let's see oh

666
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:55,018
and so it pops up a window and non-0

667
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,439
saying do you want to allow this USB to

668
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,759
do the operations input keyboard on zero

669
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,159
and I'm gonna actually say no I don't

670
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,320
want to allow that and so really like

671
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,960
there's you know there's like a way of

672
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,249
whitelisting USB devices and Linux I

673
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,809
forget what the software is called and

674
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:12,480
there's a couple of other things but for

675
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:13,889
the most part like by default there's no

676
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,080
other operating system that protects you

677
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:17,729
from malicious USB devices and isolates

678
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,059
your whole USB stack from the rest of

679
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,830
your computer I don't actually remember

680
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,960
what's on here I think that when you

681
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,759
plug it in to a Mac it'll open up a

682
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,230
terminal and sender Richelle to

683
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:33,980
something but it's been a while

684
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:37,559
okay so cubes networking it is very cool

685
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,210
this is kind of what a default cube

686
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,749
setups look like when you first install

687
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:45,179
cubes so cisnet sort of like success USB

688
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:47,720
has access to all of your USB devices

689
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:51,769
cisnet similarly has access to your

690
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,210
Ethernet and Wi-Fi devices and so this

691
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:57,090
network manager applet right now it has

692
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,440
a red border this red VM is this net so

693
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:05,389
all of this is actually running inside

694
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:08,070
of SAS net so in this diagram the blue

695
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:10,830
boxes are called proxy beams and so a

696
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,809
proxy VM is a VM that gives internet

697
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,389
access to another VM or network access

698
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:15,990
and so when you like create a new VM in

699
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,820
cubes

700
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,679
it's basically checking this provides

701
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,310
network box you can make a new proxy VM

702
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,450
so if this firewall as a proxy VM and

703
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,590
[Music]

704
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,299
says who next personal work and

705
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,090
untrusted I'll get their network from

706
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,759
sis firewall system UNIX is a special

707
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,709
case and so anon hoon X gets its network

708
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,160
from disconnects so if this unix is a

709
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,350
proxy VM that runs tor

710
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,780
it transparently purifies all of the

711
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:44,000
traffic all the like downstream traffic

712
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,639
so basically whatever you do in and on

713
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,680
hoon X it is going through the Tor

714
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,270
process that's running in Cisco necks so

715
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,390
like you basically you're on tor browser

716
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,830
in and on who necks and but you could

717
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,230
also run whatever else you want you can

718
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,210
like open up a you know a document that

719
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,680
tries to phone home inside of a non UNIX

720
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,360
and it'll phone home over tor and it

721
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,440
still won't leak your IP address and so

722
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,550
in a lot of ways it's actually very

723
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,720
similar to tails but unlike tails you

724
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,680
could have as many of them as you want

725
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,150
and so UNIX VMs are great for

726
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,370
compartmentalizing secret identities so

727
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,260
for example if you were wanted to run a

728
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,510
rogue government Twitter account making

729
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,580
a dedicated who next VM just for that

730
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,590
activity and you don't do anything

731
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,620
except for stuff related to that like

732
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,199
Twitter account is you know super useful

733
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,840
but then at the same computer you can

734
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,200
make a different phone expand to you

735
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,179
know talk to people securely and so like

736
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,050
I'm not gonna open it because of time

737
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:45,380
but like I've got this a non zero cool

738
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,360
20:18 UNIX VM and I've got an IRC client

739
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,370
and I've got like you know pigeon where

740
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,290
I could just have like OTR encrypted

741
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,879
chats with people over jabber and I've

742
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:57,260
got like email setup and everything like

743
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,490
that so as a journalist sometimes when

744
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,410
I'm talking to sources that are pretty

745
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,170
technical and we want to make sure that

746
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:07,400
the communication with sources is really

747
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:09,350
difficult for anyone to surveil I make a

748
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,990
new who next VM just for that source and

749
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,089
I have like just few like Internet

750
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:15,830
connected stuff related to that VM all

751
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,200
happen in that source so I like make a

752
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,120
new jabber account and like anonymously

753
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,189
over tor and then they do the same thing

754
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,750
on the other side and so it's a great

755
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,940
and so that way like if anything else on

756
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,260
my computer gets compromised that

757
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,210
communication with that source is

758
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:33,889
completely a separate part of my system

759
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:36,139
that doesn't get touched ok so you can

760
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,210
do a lot more cool networking stuff

761
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,669
though and here's an example of running

762
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,429
a computer a cubes computer like totally

763
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:46,190
anonymously so in this case this net has

764
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,780
your Wi-Fi or Ethernet it gives the

765
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,679
Prydz internet just this firewall it

766
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,169
provides Internet

767
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,760
UNIX everything else goes into systemics

768
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,190
or gets its internet from system X and

769
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,260
the only exception is captive portal so

770
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,640
if you like connect to Wi-Fi at

771
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,520
Starbucks and it wants you to click

772
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,828
through something you open the one like

773
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,710
kind of untrusted VM that gets its

774
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:08,059
internet straight from straight from

775
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,260
like the IP address of the network

776
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:10,369
you're connected to and you click

777
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,650
through the thing and then you can

778
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:15,109
connect to tor and then beyond that you

779
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,539
could actually make new proxy VMs that

780
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:21,710
connect to VPNs

781
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:24,109
anonymously over tor so so like in these

782
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,809
examples all the internet traffic goes

783
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:29,089
over tor in these examples all the

784
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:31,099
internet traffic goes over a VPN but the

785
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:33,609
VPN service itself doesn't even know who

786
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:37,819
you are and doesn't have your IP address

787
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:40,788
and so this is how this laptop that I'm

788
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:44,119
using right now is currently set up I've

789
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:47,480
got this net goes to sets firewall then

790
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,039
I have a VPN Germany and then a VM

791
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:57,819
called research so let's go ahead and

792
00:35:49,039 --> 00:36:02,240
open my research VM where is it research

793
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:04,369
so in order so VPN Germany is a

794
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,390
dependency of research so VPN Germany is

795
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:07,390
booting up first

796
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:23,160
okay and now research is booting and up

797
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:25,890
here wait we're gonna go right here this

798
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,879
is a separate network manager so I'm

799
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,100
actually have two different network

800
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,070
managers that this one is running incest

801
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,319
net this one is running incest research

802
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:40,560
and let's go ahead and connect to this

803
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:46,080
VPN in Germany okay what is my IP

804
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:48,210
address so I'm in so this window is in

805
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,140
Frankfurt but like you know over here

806
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,000
Kelly right now this window they're the

807
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:59,490
same there's only so many color options

808
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,570
but Kelly is in Lexington US which I

809
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:06,240
guess is where this network thinks that

810
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:10,050
we are and then this window is in

811
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,970
Germany so but I also have okay sis

812
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,150
firewall going to sis honex

813
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:17,399
going to VPN who next Hong Kong going to

814
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:23,430
Anne on VPN research so let's go ahead

815
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:25,380
and open an on VPN research so like what

816
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,960
you would probably normally do on your

817
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,360
computer is like make VPN Germany or

818
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,640
whatever VPN your default Navia but make

819
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,860
like all of these VMs I'll get its

820
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,690
internet from the VPN and this way you

821
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,250
can like ensure that you don't send any

822
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:43,610
plain text traffic except for when you

823
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:46,610
explicitly want to okay so

824
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,610
oops

825
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,920
so now I have another network manager

826
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:57,510
let's connect to a VPN in Hong Kong and

827
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,170
in this case this other network manager

828
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,880
is getting its intern or this other VPN

829
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:07,710
who next Hong Kong gets its internet

830
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,710
anonymously over tor and then I'm

831
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:17,190
connected and so where am I in this

832
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:20,609
window yeah and so this is actually

833
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,770
really Hong Kong so right now this

834
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:25,020
window and actually really any beams

835
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:29,640
that I want that I attached to this VM

836
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:32,549
or to this proxy VM are like very

837
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,319
anonymous it's basically like I mean I

838
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:36,150
guess there's a caveat that you have to

839
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:37,650
figure out how to like pay for your VPN

840
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,829
service anonymously too and that's a

841
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:42,809
whole different thing but um but using

842
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:44,280
the Internet anonymously can be really

843
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:46,289
annoying with tor browser because

844
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,240
there's CAPTCHAs everywhere a lot of

845
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:49,980
websites completely just block it or

846
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,470
give you like different content if

847
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,119
you're using tor but in this way you can

848
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,430
get around all of that you can use the

849
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,140
Internet anonymously and your VPN

850
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:05,308
provider itself doesn't even know who

851
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:09,390
you are yeah and so like this VM is so

852
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:12,210
just to recap this Firefox is going over

853
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,960
our normal network through Germany out

854
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,000
to the Internet

855
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,460
this Firefox is going through our normal

856
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,010
network through the Tor network through

857
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,700
Hong Kong out to the Internet and so you

858
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:27,510
can basically like go to Kali cube

859
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,430
settings right now the network and Kali

860
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:37,109
it's this Firewall have to set it to VPN

861
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:39,598
who next Hong Kong and okay and now

862
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:41,660
here's my Kali BM let's refresh this

863
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,660
page

864
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,540
sorry it's really slow because it's

865
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,069
going over the tor network and then over

866
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,340
Hong Kong and here we go here's like a

867
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:58,700
totally anonymous like VPN over tor Kali

868
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:01,220
Linux VPN over tor okay so this is all

869
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,169
very cool but cubes is still software

870
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,930
and on a computer which means that there

871
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,940
are vulnerabilities and there are ways

872
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:10,580
to hack it but in order to hack cubes

873
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,130
step one is you have to hack one of the

874
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,420
VMS using just a client-side exploit and

875
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,820
this is basically the same way that you

876
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,970
would hack Windows or Mac OS or Linux

877
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,190
normally but then once you actually

878
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,200
succeed in doing this step two is you

879
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:27,710
have to use a cubes exploit and in this

880
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,350
case this is actually a Zen vm escape

881
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,300
bug and then what if you do this you

882
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,549
could get arbitrary code execution and

883
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,230
dom0 and if that happens then it's game

884
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,310
over and the attacker has packed your

885
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,210
whole computer and they could access

886
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:43,009
everything but cubes recognizes that Zen

887
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,110
is kind of its biggest attack surface

888
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,190
and so it takes all these steps to try

889
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:51,470
and reduce the attack surface of Zen and

890
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,970
so basically in the so here's some

891
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,850
statistics in the last like a little

892
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,230
over seven years only about 17% of the

893
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,440
Zen vulnerabilities have actually

894
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:02,390
affected been affected by cubes but it

895
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,540
still happens like it happened last

896
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:07,609
month right so it's really important to

897
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,259
just still always install all of your

898
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:15,260
updates okay you can't do everything

899
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,790
with cubes one of the big things is 3d

900
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,140
acceleration just isn't supported in any

901
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,890
of the VMS because it's very difficult

902
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,870
to attach a like GPU to a VM in a way

903
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,060
that doesn't allow the VM to have memory

904
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,609
access to the whole system windows

905
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,890
support is limited and other than that

906
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,900
it's basically Linux so if you want to

907
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:37,160
use Mac stuff or Android or anything

908
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:39,830
else it doesn't work very well you can

909
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,529
use various Linux's and is that you

910
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,850
install fry as those and that works and

911
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,950
then there's a couple of other things

912
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,900
and one thing is it still kinda it's

913
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,580
like I mean I don't think it's that hard

914
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,110
to use but if you want to set up your

915
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,569
computer to do these cool things like

916
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,559
this there's not GUI for all of it so

917
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,809
you kind of need to

918
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:01,019
be a Linux nerd and be comfortable using

919
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:03,749
the command-line to do it very well and

920
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:05,669
then also it doesn't really work on

921
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:07,799
cheap low-end computers you kind of need

922
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,140
a good computer with a lot of RAM but it

923
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:13,920
does actually run on most PCs it doesn't

924
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,979
run on Mac hardware yeah

925
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,479
and so that is cubes if you're

926
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:21,180
interested I'm having a workshop about

927
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:25,169
cubes at 5 o'clock somewhere in your

928
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,459
schedule and I can like I don't actually

929
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,140
have any plans for the workshop other

930
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:29,009
than if you want to know how to do

931
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:34,969
something I could just show you

932
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:34,969
basically is the idea yeah any questions

933
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:54,379
I think there's a microphone somewhere

934
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,299
fantastic presentation thank you very

935
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:00,079
much my husband what a little bit more

936
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:06,369
about hardware compatibility bridges

937
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:09,289
perhaps and what about 7 by 24 security

938
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:12,079
how do you protect against it yeah okay

939
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:15,849
so here's a link that our compatibility

940
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,140
list basically cubes has various

941
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,849
hardware requirements and one of these

942
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,650
is you need to have a computer that

943
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:24,019
supports hardware virtualization which

944
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,819
all new computers have so it works on a

945
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,109
lot of things but sometimes various

946
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,308
things don't work on certain computers

947
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:30,230
so if you're thinking of like getting a

948
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:31,609
new computer for cubes definitely like

949
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,309
pick out your computer and then check

950
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,900
this link to see if the computer is

951
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:40,119
listed or not and if it's listed see if

952
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,599
there's any like known problems and a

953
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,660
physical security

954
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,569
okay so cubes helps you a lot with

955
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,368
physical security in terms of you know

956
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:50,599
like if somebody like walks over and

957
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,890
plug something into your computer

958
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:53,660
whether you're not looking cubes can

959
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,558
protect against that but it can't

960
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,700
protect against evil mate attacks and

961
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,349
like there's really like various

962
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,629
mitigations to evil mate attacks but in

963
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:05,390
the end none of them work against all

964
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,890
attacks and so carry your laptop with

965
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,868
you everywhere you go or if you want to

966
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,910
you can use an app called Haven and on a

967
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:12,859
spare Android phone so if you like leave

968
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,538
your laptop in your hotel room you leave

969
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,460
out an Android phone running Haven like

970
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:19,369
sitting on top of it and it uses all of

971
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,750
its sensors to detect like intrusions

972
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,289
into the room and sends you signal

973
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,289
notifications

974
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,360
can you run top and dom0 can you know

975
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,360
yeah

976
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:53,120
yeah question how much of this setup of

977
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,770
cubes can be done by default so that

978
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,440
you're operating in a safe mode for

979
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,630
example do you have the option to open

980
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,920
attachments do you have to say all the

981
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,930
time you want to open open the

982
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,060
attachment in this VM that's disposable

983
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,940
or can you accidentally open attachments

984
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,830
in other VMS where they could do harm is

985
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,080
there some way to make this thing mark

986
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:15,380
yeah though more foolproof for you

987
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,480
rather you know Arab men minimize the

988
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,710
chance that you will you know you'll

989
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,860
have to be on alert every time you open

990
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:26,330
and click something right so like for

991
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,920
this folder of sketchy documents if I

992
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,420
just double click on this it'll open in

993
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,870
my work via a man deck and that might be

994
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,990
a mistake

995
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,670
and if I right click on it and open in a

996
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:38,240
disposal VM then that will manually do

997
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:41,060
it and so it's actually like not built

998
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,819
into cubes but not too hard to design

999
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,070
yourself you can basically make a

1000
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,430
desktop file that says that it can

1001
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:52,280
handle a PDF file the PDF mime types and

1002
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:55,009
then make it so that what that does is

1003
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,440
it launches qvm open and DVM and so

1004
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,580
there's some of the stuff like you got

1005
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,030
so like if you want to do things like

1006
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,529
this

1007
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,750
cubes totally makes it possible you just

1008
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,550
have to like do a bit of like writing a

1009
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,200
little script yourself to do it and I

1010
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:10,610
think that's one of the things that you

1011
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,960
know will get better over time but but

1012
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,940
yeah so you could you could do stuff you

1013
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,130
just need to know what you're doing and

1014
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,080
set it up manually because non-technical

1015
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,910
computer users constantly asked me how

1016
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,220
can I use my computer safely and this

1017
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,350
this is still not the operating system

1018
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,450
for a non-technical user but it might be

1019
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,069
one day it sounds like yeah and like the

1020
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,140
Thunderbird attachments I feel like

1021
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,540
email attachments always opening in

1022
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:36,920
disposal vm's are really like like

1023
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:38,630
that's pretty key because because email

1024
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,090
attachments are untrusted and this is

1025
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,820
how it like if it weren't for you know

1026
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:48,110
spearfishing the like election probably

1027
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:50,770
wouldn't have gotten hacked so yeah oh

1028
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:56,470
look there's an email

1029
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:58,119
I'll open that later I think the

1030
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,259
question is a little bit related to the

1031
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,280
today

1032
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:06,130
question the last question how much

1033
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,160
intensive work is it I guess it is it a

1034
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:11,320
feature in the cubes where you were

1035
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,690
linking to encryption keys and the email

1036
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,730
to passwords or is it something that you

1037
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:18,130
had to write some scripts and and

1038
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,320
configure it is a feature built into

1039
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:28,089
cubes it's called split GPG in here let

1040
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:34,450
me open a a new disposable VM or I guess

1041
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:37,299
I could do it in this German one split

1042
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,279
GPG cubes so the cubes website has a lot

1043
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,089
of really good documentation including a

1044
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,089
lot of this stuff so this explains how

1045
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:47,529
split GvG works and how to set it up it

1046
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:50,049
requires like a little bit of manual

1047
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:52,830
setup you need to basically like make a

1048
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:56,650
VM that has your secret keys in it and

1049
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:58,000
then drop a file in the right place and

1050
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:02,130
the VM that you want to use your secret

1051
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,710
keys so I like you know use a GP GVM

1052
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,540
that both my email VM and my software

1053
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,089
development VM connect to using split

1054
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,580
GPG so that way can like GPG sign get

1055
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:19,150
commits but also use the same key to

1056
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:22,810
decrypt emails how do you view the

1057
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:26,589
backups for that guy individual VMs get

1058
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:30,009
their own or so there is a backup and

1059
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:35,380
restore system that is actually really

1060
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:36,880
nice it basically I guess it's hard to

1061
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,260
demonstrate without like plugging in an

1062
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,790
external disk the backups will all

1063
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,790
obviously have to be local there's no

1064
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:45,880
like network backup but you basically

1065
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:48,759
can like mount a disk in a VM and then

1066
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,560
tell this dumb zero which VM it's

1067
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,540
mounted in and where your your backup

1068
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,099
location is and then you just have like

1069
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,599
a list of all your VMs and you can say

1070
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:57,160
which ones you want to backup and then

1071
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,300
you click start and then it takes it

1072
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,980
actually takes like a long time it takes

1073
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,550
like 45 minutes but then when you're

1074
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,590
done that what you

1075
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,150
have like a giant file and then later

1076
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,440
you got like a new computer and you just

1077
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:14,270
restore from that file and you have the

1078
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:16,190
exact same setup no let's see when I

1079
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,530
checked the website I noticed that

1080
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:20,270
cubes itself is for x64 only at the

1081
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,010
moment this might be barking up the

1082
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,509
wrong tree in terms of performant

1083
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,340
devices out there running on other

1084
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,770
platforms but do you anticipate that it

1085
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,420
will be eventually supported like on arm

1086
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,400
or other things like that yes since

1087
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,090
especially Xen apparently has an arm oh

1088
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,970
really

1089
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:37,040
yeah um I don't know what I do know is

1090
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,620
that the cubes development team is like

1091
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,390
small there's like three or four of them

1092
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,270
and then there's like some volunteers

1093
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,859
and I think that it's unlikely unless

1094
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:47,000
they get like a lot of resources that

1095
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,210
they're gonna focus on a different

1096
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,950
platform other than just like x86 64 but

1097
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,720
maybe hopefully maybe someday they'll

1098
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:57,890
have like 100 million dollars and can

1099
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,270
it'll work on everything so you

1100
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,160
mentioned how important it is to protect

1101
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,680
down zero and if anything gets in down

1102
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,990
zero it's just game over so it seemed

1103
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,569
sort of counterintuitive that you

1104
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,189
plugged in the untrusted USB device and

1105
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,750
it immediately prompted you if you want

1106
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,490
to connect that to dom0

1107
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:16,250
right and why would you ever want to

1108
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,740
connect any USB device to dom0 because

1109
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,630
the USB device that I plugged on it's

1110
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,430
the USB rubber ducky and basically it

1111
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,170
tells computers that you plug it in that

1112
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:27,680
it's a human interface device so a

1113
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,060
keyboard and you would never actually

1114
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,830
want to connect anything to Nam zero

1115
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,049
with the exception of keyboards because

1116
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,569
if your keyboard isn't plugged into dom0

1117
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,130
you can't use it to use dom0 so you

1118
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,020
can't actually like press alt tab to

1119
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,840
switch windows and you can't like type

1120
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,910
stuff in dom0 windows and stuff like

1121
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,400
that so to actually use a keyboard in

1122
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,420
cubes you have to attach it to down zero

1123
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,520
which is one of the reasons why

1124
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,830
keyboards and cubes USB keyboards and

1125
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,450
cubes are disabled by default and I just

1126
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,890
keep them disabled I used to use USB

1127
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,319
keyboards with like a docking station

1128
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,540
now I just have my like laptop and a

1129
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,990
monitor and it emmaus Mouse's work mice

1130
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,990
work fine

1131
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:14,449
cool thank you

1132
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:14,449
[Applause]
