1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,680
hi so tracking censorship and

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,070
surveillance has been increasing around

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,830
the world so we've been quite busy each

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,109
of us is going to talk about a different

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,210
area of Tor our little slice of the

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,320
onion so Alison will talk about

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,570
community and UX George and and David

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,060
will talk about the network and Matt

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,580
will talk about the applications so

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,649
first I'm gonna start by talking about

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,218
what is tor and louder

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,850
so first so first I'm gonna start Abbas

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,180
started us off by talking about tor and

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,530
some news from the organization and

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,870
communications and then we'll each talk

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,789
about our little slice of the onion so

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,669
what is tor when we say tor it means a

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,010
lot of different things the tour is a

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,320
nonprofit organization that base is

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,329
based out of Seattle it's a community of

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,970
volunteers and contributors around the

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,840
world it's free and open source software

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,400
for privacy and freedom online and we

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,960
believe everyone should have access

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,020
private access to an open web so at the

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,899
backbone of all of our software is the

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,929
Tor network the Tor network is a network

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,360
of volunteer run servers around the

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,970
world we call these relays so when you

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,100
use tor your traffic is relayed through

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,700
these servers and encrypted three times

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,630
along the way so the easiest way to use

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,850
tor is tor browser so tor browser is

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,460
built from firefox with some extra

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,110
privacy and security patches added it

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,149
protects you from tracking surveillance

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,090
and censorship so if you're in a country

38
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,270
where there are blocked sites and you

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,610
can access those using tor browser it

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,009
obscures your IP address prevents

41
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,259
Network observation prevents location

42
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,409
determination blocks fingerprinting

43
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,630
prevents cross-site correlation blocks

44
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,990
cookies and scripts doesn't write

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,478
anything to disk

46
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,530
there's no browser history so it's

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,540
protections are quite comprehensive the

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,790
Tor network can also be used to publish

49
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,859
with privacy and we call these onion

50
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,920
services so with onion services the

51
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,200
traffic never leaves the network you

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,880
meet at rendezvous rendezvous points

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,569
over the network it's in two end

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,019
encrypted

55
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,119
even without HTTPS and onion services

56
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,270
can be used for secure and private

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,030
communications file sharing securing IOT

58
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,780
devices and configuring websites in

59
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,720
these end in dot onion so onion services

60
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,510
are lute used in global leeks which is a

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,670
whistle blowing platform secure drop for

62
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,609
secure communication between journalists

63
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,670
and their sources and onion share which

64
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,440
is secure an anonymous file sharing so

65
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,839
these are just a few examples of how

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,700
onion services can be used there are a

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
couple of mainstream sites now that have

68
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,410
for more than a couple that have dot

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,190
onion addresses you can visit the New

70
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,190
York Times

71
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,630
ProPublica privacy international

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,980
Facebook and you can visit all these

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:20,799
sites on the dark web we have a campaign

74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,929
right now to onion eyes the web so we

75
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,150
want to demystify onion services we

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,459
think these these sites provide the

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,690
privacy and security that that people

78
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,019
should be it should be demanding right

79
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,030
now so if you have the ability to set up

80
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,360
an onion site we encourage you to do so

81
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,769
if you know of a news organization or a

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,310
nonprofit organization that would

83
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,829
benefit from this censorship resistant

84
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,730
site we hope that you'll help them set

85
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:51,459
one up and what else can you do to stay

86
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,410

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,330
manager she's done unprecedented work

105
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400

organization she's led usability

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,810
initiatives and the UX team and so

108
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,390
because of all the work that she's done

109
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,340
and the growth of the organization

110
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,310
we're actually hiring two project

111
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,810
manager positions so we're looking for a

112
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,030
project manager that can help with

113
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,760
Network projects and for a project

114
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,830
manager with product experience so if

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,230
you have any experience or know anyone

that does please refer them to our

117
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:10,940
website now let's hear what the other

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,730
teams are up to hey everybody my name is

119
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,860
Alison and I am the community team lead

120
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,990
and I also work pretty closely with the

121
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,030
UX team so some of the things that I

122
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,100
think are most exciting about working on

123
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,739
tour right now is that we're focusing a

124
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,010
lot on making tour work better for real

125
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,680
human beings both in the usability sense

126
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,380
of the word and also in the community

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,360
building sense so our two teams work

128
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,890
really closely together we work on

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,110
things like supporting relay operators

130
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,880
providing support for tor users

131
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,060
organizing tour events doing user

132
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,710
testing translation and localization and

133
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,210
I want to tell you about a couple of the

134
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,250
projects that we have right now that I

135
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,359
think are particularly exciting I'm not

136
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,460
even really using these I'm just going

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,380
to skip ahead one thing we're doing is

138
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,070
we're redesigning our whole website with

139
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,360
new users in mind so we have a lot of

140
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,570
things that we're working on to make the

141
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,250
website itself a lot more easy to use

142
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,070
and navigate we're improving our

143
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,410
documentation improving our downloads

144
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,780
page and and focusing on better

145
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,160
translation and localization we are

146
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,169
building a few specific portals for

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,600
different types of people who we who

148
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,169
either use our work on tour so one that

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,860
we have in testing right now is a

150
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,990
support or project org

151
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,880
it's basically a one-stop shop for

152
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,610
people who use tor who might need a

153
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,330
little bit of help understanding it it

154
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,540
has a searchable QA it has tour manuals

155
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,840
it has a tour glossary with definitions

156
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,490
and we're working on developing that

157
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,679
right now and so that's like a really

158
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,490
good way to get involved especially if

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,960
you have experience with localization or

160
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,830
translation because we want to put it

161
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,109
into our top 12 tier one languages we're

162
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,789
also building a dev portal for all

163
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,140
things development related to tour so

164
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,470
getting involved with the with a dev

165
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,330
side of things and also with research

166
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,910
that's gonna be a dev tour project org

167
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,620
and then finally we're making community

168
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,740
or project org which is going to be

169
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,870
information about outreach for tour

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,410
trainers for members of civil society

171
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,290
organizations that want to use tour and

172
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,240
teach others about it user testing

173
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,670
information about getting involved with

174
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,320
translation and then other ways to get

175
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,830
involved with the two teams community

176
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,320
and UX we are working on a number of

177
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,000
things to make tour not only more

178
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,880
useable around the world but get more

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,130
people from all over the world using and

180
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,500
hacking on it so we've been doing this

181
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,409
by connecting with community members in

182
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,030
places where we have historically not

183
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,340
been so great at connecting with our

184
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,369
community so so far some of the places

185
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,169
that we've gone to do user testing and

186
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,520
work with civil society organizations

187
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:05,400
include Uganda Colombia Brazil this

188
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,010
month we're going to Kenya in the coming

189
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,780
months we will go to Indonesia and India

190
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,580
and the kind of work that we're doing

191
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,729
there is we're meeting with the kinds of

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,890
people that need tour that tour fits

193
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,920
into their threat model so environmental

194
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:23,700
activists feminist activists

195
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:27,540
gender-based violence activists you know

196
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,760
digital security people to basically all

197
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,620
kinds of people that are making more

198
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,130
justice in the world

199
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,110
and to that end we have some new roles

200
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,360
in the Tor project that are that are

201
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,550
supporting this work so we have a new

202
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,800
full-time community liaison whose base

203
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,099
going around the world working with with

204
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,449
folks like that we have a new relay

205
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,460
advocate I'll tell you a little bit more

206
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,740
about that in a second we have a new

207
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,930
translation coordinator a new user

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,130
research coordinator and we're really

209
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,349
excited that we've been working with

210
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,000
outreach e for the last two rounds so

211
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,000
that's been really cool too because they

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,820
bring people in to free software that

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,660
historically have not had so much of a

214
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,550
presence so our another thing that we're

215
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,760
doing in terms of building community is

216
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,229
running tor meetups so kind of related

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,300
to the community building work that

218
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,990
we're doing around user testing and

219
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,449
usability

220
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,090
we're holding meetups for people who are

221
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,600
interested in learning about using tor

222
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,550
or hacking on it or who have been people

223
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,620
who run relays or who are interested in

224
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,459
it some of the places that we have had

225
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,880
these IRL meetups are Portugal India

226
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,890
Brazil Greece the US and Germany and

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,570
we're holding more of those all the time

228
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,010
so that's a really good way to get

229
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,700
involved with the community team and

230
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:51,630
meet other interested tour people in

231
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,210
real life and we're doing a lot more to

232
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,430
support our global network of relay

233
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,600
operators so the relays basically make

234
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,280
up the backbone of the Tor network

235
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,580
without relays you don't have tor and so

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:08,760
we want to provide better support for

237
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,580
the folks who who make tor happen so we

238
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,520
have a new person who is full-time who

239
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,950
his entire job is basically making sure

240
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,140
the relay operators are happy running

241
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,120
meetups we have this really awesome new

242
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,910
really operators guide that's a lot more

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
comprehensive and you can learn more

244
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,719
about that at our table we have some

245
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,330
fliers with information about it it's

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,040
translated into it's in English Spanish

247
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:36,780
and and Brazilian Portuguese and the

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,370
last thing that I'll say that we're that

249
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,630
we're working on on those teams is

250
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,120
something called the library freedom

251
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,500
Institute we've at tor we've been

252
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,840
working with librarians for a while

253
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,209
because they are pretty fierce defenders

254
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,879
of privacy and we got a

255
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:54,189
to build a training program that's about

256
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,990
six months long to teach librarians

257
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,129
mostly in the United States but it's all

258
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,100
open source and it's going to get

259
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:04,990
translated about free software and

260
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,420
surveillance and I'm like way ahead I'm

261
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,220
just talking teaching them about free

262
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,709
software and surveillance and threat

263
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,410
modeling so that they can bring these

264
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,758
strategies and tools directly into their

265
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,759
local communities here I'll skip ahead

266
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,689
there's a there's where I'm at now um so

267
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,430
yeah it's a pretty exciting project and

268
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:28,839
like I said it's all it's all open

269
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,120
source and so you can follow our

270
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,160
progress at library freedom chat and

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,660
there's a link to our github repo with

272
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,089
all the resources that we're creating

273
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,170
and then finally if you are interested

274
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,740
in getting involved with the community

275
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:45,998
and UX teams you can find us on our see

276
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,499
on the OU FTC Network the the different

277
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,059
rooms are listed up there you can also

278
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,610
come stop by the table and talk to me

279
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:54,519

282
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,569
a lot of information about the team and

283
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:05,378
different projects we're working on and

284
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:07,509
how you can get involved yeah I can I

285
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,410
can advance over here this is now we

286
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:13,720
don't we don't need that we have too

287
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:17,850
many laptops I can I can I can advance

288
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:22,480
if you want because this is the one okay

289
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,889
all right so we me and George here on

290
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,050
the table we are from the network team

291
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:27,160
so in tour we have many teams and the

292
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,170
network team is the one that is

293
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,529
responsible for the entire tour network

294
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,209
and the tour software so see it as every

295
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,970
bites that touches the network the

296
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:38,859
networking is involved just a quick

297
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,230
overview basically right now we have

298
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,480
around seven full-time developer is

299
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,740
working on the tour software which is

300
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,389
the court or software and I put in ten

301
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,829
very active contributors we have more

302
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,529
contributors than that but we have ten

303
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:56,319
very very very active we have constant

304
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,059
patch from them every week and there are

305
00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:00,550
volunteers around the world we have

306
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:04,360
people in Spain in

307
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,930
Thailand and different other places it's

308
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,570
it's really well well spreaded around

309
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,180
the world so as I said we're responsible

310
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,620
for everything we maintain a software

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,680
called tour and the architecture of the

312
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,589
network so since the last onion report

313
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,180
two years ago a taupe we it's it's been

314
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,130
two years we've been doing many many

315
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,560
many things and if you may also recall

316
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,070
we also had an onion service talk about

317
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,760
the version three in that generation so

318
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,170
this is a big big part of of what's

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,660
going on in toy is they didn't service

320
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,490
version three so those big onion address

321
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,670
are actually a thing now it's been

322
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,529
released and the only way the only thing

323
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,569
you have to do to enable it is to add

324
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,330
this Purple Line aden version Eden

325
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,459
service version three we won't go into

326
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,940
details but one of the important part

327
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,069
you have to keep in mind is that in the

328
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,899
next years also maybe one or two years

329
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,100
we're gonna deprecated the version 2 and

330
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,870
the version 2 is the one that everyone

331
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,570
knows that 16 characters onion address

332
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:09,360
so if you're running an onion services

333
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:12,130
please move to this more awesome thing

334
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,290
quickly so also another thing we added

335
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,670
is NetFlow padding it is kind of a

336
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,670
complicated thing I won't go into

337
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:22,660
details again but the gifts they're just

338
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,520
just is climbed to really when you enter

339
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,350
the network as tor browser as a client

340
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,790
you enter to the relay at a guard level

341
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,190
what's called an entry point the guard

342
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,560
and we create we have this editor add

343
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:36,420
that if padding between the client and

344
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,040
relay which basically is trying to

345
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,930
protect again the global observer at

346
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,719
this at this layer when you enter the

347
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:47,079
network and we call it NetFlow because

348
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,820
it is specialized at going around the

349
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,859
net flows on the the core routers of

350
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,250
internet providers or Austin also

351
00:14:50,860 --> 00:15:00,430
providers another very interesting thing

352
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:02,320
is we oh yes we started using rust in

353
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,089
Taurus so it's experimental and by

354
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,089
experimental we mean that we

355
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,029
[Laughter]

356
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,190
we we implemented a very specific

357
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:16,290
subsistent and tour in rus to see how it

358
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,580
goes and we work with this we can deploy

359
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,800
it in tour runs on any architecture tour

360
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,279
browsers of course the humongous use

361
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,219
case so we're working towards adding

362
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:33,270
more things in rust in tour as and it

363
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,589
ties in with another slide we have that

364
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:39,390
George can present so I won't go into

365
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:41,370
details there so this part is extremely

366
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,810
technical again but if you're interested

367
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,540
you can come see us at the table

368
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,569
downstairs or after the talk so we added

369
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:52,170
this is a very very nice example of

370
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,870
research academic research going into a

371
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,849
production kiss so the current form

372
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,620
socket transport so all the cells so

373
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,080
basically tor exchange data between

374
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,550
relays and we call those packet data

375
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,310
cell and we had added this way better

376
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,349
scheduler that allows us to have better

377
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,079
congestion control over all the relays

378
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,620
which are you know 6500 relays around

379
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,720
the internet so yep this is very nice

380
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,959
and I think the next part is gonna be

381
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,120
George now so another thing we've been

382
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,029
doing is we've been trying to improve

383
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,550
the experience of people using tor and

384
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:32,040
the mobile down to the torah' core layer

385
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,680
and not on the browser side so we've

386
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,130
been trying to make tor consume less CPU

387
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,170
and less and less resources in general

388
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,850
to improve battery life as well as we've

389
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,550
been improving the interface through

390
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,560
which applications integrate with tor so

391
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,920
instead of like having to spawn your own

392
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,069
Tauruses as a mobile application you can

393
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,319
now use it as a library basically it's a

394
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,880
it's a pretty good approach for the

395
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,470
future since everything is going to be

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,029
mobile also if you've been not seeing

397
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,600
what's going on on the internet lately

398
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:09,630
on december we've been we've been under

399
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,240
attack through some denial of service

400
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,980
situation through which like people are

401
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,780
using our network to fight with each

402
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,010
other or we don't know exactly what's

403
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,980
going on because it's an anonymity

404
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,140
network but basically

405
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,240
but like basically the performance has

406
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,240
had degraded back in December because

407
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,220
like terms of circuits we were running

408
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,770
around and like causing trouble and like

409
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,360
even like normal clients would make more

410
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,010
circuits and they could get dropped and

411
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,469
they would make more and like chaos was

412
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,960
happening so we had to step in and like

413
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,350
introduce a denial-of-service sub module

414
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,360
which basically like tries to it is

415
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,879
built on the relays and it tries to like

416
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,678
impose some limits on what clients can

417
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,710
do so like if you're a client and you're

418
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,340
making like 20,000 circuits a second we

419
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,440
cut you off you know and this has

420
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,770
improved the situation considerably and

421
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,210
now performance is back to our good old

422
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:10,450
ourselves another thing we've been doing

423
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,300
is that we've been improving the code

424
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,179
base so that it's now a bit more tidy

425
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,450
and a bit nicer to like navigate through

426
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,980
we've been like like from the back from

427
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,190
the previous directory structure we'll

428
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:30,059
be moving to a more modern one like you

429
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:32,260
can check it out it's it's nicer now and

430
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,480
so another thing I want to tell you

431
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,850
about is that we've been doing lots of

432
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,740
work and improving security for a guard

433
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,110
node which is the first node that you

434
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,330
visit as a tour client and it's super

435
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,610
important for your security and we've

436
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,309
been thinking a lot on how to improve

437
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,290
the security we offer there we've been

438
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,928
improving the algorithms we've been in

439
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,809
doing research and how it works today

440
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:59,920
actually we published a blog post that

441
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:02,370
is presenting an add-on that you can use

442
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,440
on your onion service and it makes it

443
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,169
less vulnerable and more secure against

444
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,540
certain super like advanced attacks that

445
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,520
we've been thinking about and we made it

446
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,470
as an add-on like a Python application

447
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,570
that like interacts with tor over the

448
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,610
control port so you can test it out and

449
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,490
let us know how it works check out our

450
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,879
blog you can see a blog post about this

451
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,100
thing it's called vanguards

452
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,650
that's it from the network team now on

453
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,959
the browser side

454
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:37,050
hi I'm Matt I work on the applications

455
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,760
team when people think about tor they

456
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,750
generally don't think about the

457
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,200
application layer they generally think

458
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,960
about the network layer and many people

459
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:51,570
wonder exactly why tor is even touching

460
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,180
applications and what use cases actually

461
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:58,020
has and it's important to really think

462
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,980
about how tor works and what we're

463
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,710
trying to accomplish

464
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,020
so the tor team that the application

465
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:10,559
team has about eleven main active

466
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,800
contributors but we have another dozen

467
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,530
or so anonymous contributors online and

468
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:23,309
who interact through our through the bug

469
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:26,190
system and the current state of a lot of

470
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,170
applications is that if you were to

471
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,510
basically hook up that application to

472
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,030
the local tour proxy and then just send

473
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,540
all send all that traffic through it

474
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,520
basically will give you location privacy

475
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:43,309
but it won't give you any of the

476
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:46,230
additional identif identification

477
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,970
anonymity and this is really what we

478
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,790
tried to accomplish with at the

479
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,820
application layer where there are

480
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:56,010
basically two main supported

481
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,100
applications one is called tor birdie

482
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,760
which is a plug-in to Thunderbird and

483
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,820
this is basically a volunteer project

484
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:09,030
which allows you to connect over tor

485
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,750
using Thunderbird for you mail but the

486
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:19,260
main supported application is tor

487
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:21,120
browser and this is this is really kind

488
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,270
of the state of the art in terms of

489
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,149
providing an application that actually

490
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,550
respects the user's privacy and doesn't

491
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,730
leak identifying information or when it

492
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,610
does it's by the user's choice and the

493
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,830
user has the power to basically wash

494
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,729
away all of the information that has

495
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,100
been given away and start fresh and so

496
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,730
over the last couple years tor browser

497
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:52,408
has been adding in new features and the

498
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:56,429
most recent highlight that we're really

499
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:58,590
happy about is that we're releasing a

500
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:02,960
new version of tor browser based on the

501
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:07,889
most recent release of Firefox SR 60 and

502
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,470
as Steph mentioned earlier fire a tor

503
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:13,168
browser is based on Firefox we take the

504
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,809
Firefox code we have a separate set of

505
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:20,899
patches on top of Firefox which provide

506
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:25,019
these site isolation and minimize

507
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:30,750
writing to disk and dozens of other

508
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:32,460
features and it's it's really exciting

509
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,120
to see the progress of this because

510
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,070
Mozilla has been extremely supportive in

511
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:43,799
what patches they are actually accepting

512
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:46,320
upstream and ESR 60 the the vanilla

513
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:49,289
Mozilla release actually incorporates

514
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,740
numerous of our patches that they have

515
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:54,510
accepted and are releasing to the public

516
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,360
so it's not just the hundreds of

517
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,370
thousands or you know small millions of

518
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,469
tor browser users it's the tens of

519
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,518
millions of Mozilla users that are

520
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,870
actually going to be benefiting from

521
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:10,679
this and as more patches are up streams

522
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:13,830
we're very excited to get to a state

523
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,409
where we hopefully won't actually be

524
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,590
maintaining our own browser and everyone

525
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:21,630
will just spend the fit from private

526
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:27,840
browser mode that actually is a private

527
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:30,090
browser mode and with that we're other

528
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,059
browsers have actually started to see

529
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:38,070
the benefit of this and we're eagerly

530
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:40,590
watching what brave and clicks are are

531
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,970
starting to provide and are thinking

532
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,070
about integrating into their own

533
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:47,010
browsers and hopefully we'll see this

534
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,750
trend where all web browsers actually

535
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:53,070
provide a private browsing mode that

536
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,450
respects the users privacy so in

537
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,559
addition over the last couple years

538
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,480
we've been working on

539
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,428
the actual usability of tor browser

540
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,649
because it's not just a private browsing

541
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:05,429
mode where you open firefox and you open

542
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:11,189
a private browser and it's easy to use

543
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:13,559
because tor has with its added features

544
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,990
it has a bit of add complexity so we've

545
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,049
been trying to provide a user interface

546
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,639
that is something that the user

547
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:22,379
understands what's happening or at least

548
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:28,439
has some view into what's happening and

549
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:30,809
so we've we created a new circuit

550
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,999
display so when you actually go to a

551
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:35,999
circuit in this case this isn't an onion

552
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:39,330
service to the new york times and we

553
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:41,580
show the the three hops on the user side

554
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,309
but because it's an onion service we

555
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,399
don't know what the other hops are on

556
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:49,139
for the onion service side so we

557
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:53,789
basically just have relay placeholders

558
00:24:49,139 --> 00:25:00,559
in this case but with tor browser it's

559
00:24:53,789 --> 00:25:03,869
the it's it's important to remember that

560
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,580
usability is one of the most important

561
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,369
features that we can provide

562
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,658
because if tor browser isn't usable then

563
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:17,789
no one's going to use it so in addition

564
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:19,950
we also we added within the URL bar that

565
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:21,840
when a user is connecting to an onion

566
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:26,129
service there's actually an indicator

567
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,619
that along with a lock icon where

568
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:31,049
basically everyone is familiar with when

569
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,959
you go to an HTTPS website that if you

570
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:37,200
have a lock icon it's we're teaching

571
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,999
people that that's okay and so in that

572
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,369
same vein we're adding an onion too as

573
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,980
an indicator that visiting and onion

574
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:49,590
site is actually okay it's actually a

575
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,869
secure connection end-to-end and it's

576
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,139
something that shouldn't be scary even

577
00:25:51,869 --> 00:26:00,649
if it's just HTTP without TLS on top

578
00:25:55,139 --> 00:26:04,469
then the onion connection itself is

579
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:06,750
authenticated and encrypted and is in

580
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,019
many cases better than what TLS can

581
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,019
provide

582
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:20,640
and so with this with this going back to

583
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:23,969
the talking about mobile and how mobile

584
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,510
is actually a very important platform

585
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,429
for everyone around the world and with

586
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:32,760
what George talked about about providing

587
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,679
better mobile support for tor we're

588
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,049
actually really happy and extremely

589
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,260
excited to be able to say that we're

590
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:45,029
actually officially developing a tor

591
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,860
browser for Android historically one of

592
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:50,220
our very close partners the Guardian

593
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,549
project was working on an app called

594
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,990
orfox and they put a lot of time and

595
00:26:53,549 --> 00:27:00,210
effort and they created an app that was

596
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:02,490
extremely good but it did not quite have

597
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,010
feature parity with tor browser on

598
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:09,720
desktop and so we're finally getting

599
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:14,210
into having full time developers who are

600
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:20,130
creating that that feature parody so

601
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:22,520
these are just some screenshots but on

602
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,429
Android will basically have the same

603
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,710
circuit isolation so when you go to two

604
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,649
separate websites they will be separated

605
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,909
across two separate circuits to provide

606
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:37,889
two unique identities on the other end

607
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:42,029
this is something that orfox hasn't

608
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,770
provided and we're basically really

609
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,179
excited within the next couple weeks we

610
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:49,289
should be releasing our first alpha

611
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,669
version and we are really looking

612
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,539
forward to getting feedback and

613
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:56,990
providing a browser for Android that

614
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,840
actually respects people's privacy and

615
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,909
people can be confident that they can

616
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,970
use the web without being tracked and

617
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:10,740
without leaking identifying information

618
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,120
onto their device and along with tor

619
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,580
browser for Android the Guardian project

620
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:20,418
has has been helping another tor

621
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,178
community member mighty goes to create

622
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:26,159
what is as close

623
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:30,070
to a tor browser on iOS as is possible

624
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,559
iOS has a lot of restrictions built into

625
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,110
it that prevent actually creating a

626
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,809
browser that has feature parity on iOS

627
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,810
compared to Android and desktop but

628
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,090
onion browser is extremely close and

629
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:52,299
[Music]

630
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:53,678
they are going to be doing a push and an

631
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:59,769
announcement for the new version of

632
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:01,360
buggy browser well so we just heard a

633
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:03,690
whole lot of things from different teams

634
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,519
and now we want to take your questions

635
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,580
so what's the best way to do that here

636
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:20,230
are there mics that people stand lineup

637
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:22,110
that maybe first please please frame

638
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,460
your question in the form of a question

639
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,139
with a question mark

640
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,110
and we'd especially love to hear from

641
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:30,908
people who are not traditionally

642
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,539
represented well in free software so

643
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,610
women non-binary people people of color

644
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,549
and people who are not from the US or

645
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,049
the EU or a combination of any of those

646
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:43,059
things so if you're not one of those of

647
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:50,649
course you're welcome but you know let's

648
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:53,200
keep it diverse all are welcome so so as

649
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:55,449
tor becomes more mainstream and the Tor

650
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,399
project moves to try to onion eyes the

651
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,350
whole internet and become an alternative

652
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:06,309
and/or a complement to TLS do messaging

653
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:10,449
terms like hidden deep dark have any

654
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:13,059
value or place any longer and if they

655
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,950
don't I was just curious if there are

656
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:18,759
plans in place to remove these terms

657
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:21,369
from the Tor RC files and the Tor

658
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,590
project website documentation and public

659
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,149
talks and I only heard that word hate in

660
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:29,928
one time so you guys did a really good

661
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:32,928
job today yeah we

662
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:36,080
have been switching our language a bit

663
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:39,159
to meet - to reach new people there are

664
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,840
some definite limitations besides just

665
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,869
how the messaging might hit your ear a

666
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,330
regarding hidden and dark web there are

667
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:48,740
a lot of complications but I think we're

668
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,779
never gonna be able to control it all

669
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,600
the way and so there will always be

670
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:55,789
certain people that refer to the dark

671
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,740
web or hidden services and maybe that's

672
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,570
okay you know sometimes you're a hacker

673
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,429
sometimes you're an engineer and

674
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,820
different people talk about it in

675
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:06,860
different ways so we do prefer that you

676
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,049
use onion services and rather than

677
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,469
hidden services I think this will help

678
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:14,809
onion eyes the web and bring tor to to

679
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,269
more people but we appreciate you

680
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,519
talking about us however you may in

681
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:24,169
terms of changing hidden services

682
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,600
directories yes it has been we trying to

683
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,639
change it - onion service and I think we

684
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,219
have a patch in or coming in that's

685
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:33,769
gonna have an alien alias for ell every

686
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,840
hidden service option into our c2 onion

687
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:38,269
service I think that's the best thing we

688
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,149
can do in terms of technical things I

689
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:41,749
just want to add one thing regarding the

690
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,699
dark web

691
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:45,230
we kind of have lost that fight a little

692
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,059
bit but my feeling is that we should

693
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,009
just lean all the way into it

694
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:53,509
the dark web is real the dark web is

695
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:55,519
cool the dark web is the future and when

696
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:57,889
people are like oh the dark web is scary

697
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,629
are actually our new executive director

698
00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:01,279
has a really great comeback to that

699
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,570
which is what's the biggest dark web

700
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,909
site on the Internet does anybody know

701
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:12,019
what it is it's Facebook so I know right

702
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:14,929
it's so I like using the dark web I want

703
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:16,580
to I want to take it back so yeah if you

704
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,590
want to I mean keep talking about the

705
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,539
dark web and started talking about how

706
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,029
positive it is we're starting to lean

707
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:28,990
into it and together we can make it

708
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:36,789
happen we can't really see so just yes

709
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:39,190
if you're I have a question about the

710
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:41,830
third version of protocol and

711
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,900
specifically about the onion addresses

712
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,840
the 16 character

713
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,390
dresses are pretty easy to memorize and

714
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,360
just write down whereas the new

715
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,430
addresses are what like 64 characters do

716
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,050
you have any suggestions for dealing

717
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:00,340
with that like it's not something you

718
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:05,110
can easily write in a napkin anymore

719
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:07,330
so I agree with you another step forward

720
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,760
in this direction although I would say

721
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:13,540
that also 16 characters is not something

722
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,129
a normal human being can memorize so we

723
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:19,360
were already kind of screwed in this

724
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:21,610
regard but we have serious plans for

725
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,550
improving the situation here we're

726
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:27,610
hoping to get funding to pursue one of

727
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,409
the many possible solutions that we've

728
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:33,520
been thinking of like simple solutions

729
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:35,770
like like add-ons into the browser to

730
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,070
make it easier to map like normal

731
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:41,050
websites or other TL DS to onion we've

732
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,620
been thinking of like more complicated

733
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:48,100
stuff like like full-on name systems

734
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:51,340
like I don't know like whatever namecoin

735
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,840
blocks Takia nests whatever we've been

736
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,030
thinking about making our own name

737
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,980
system in tutorial we we've had a few

738
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,070
ideas we are now trying to get funding

739
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,510
and like like full-time developers to

740
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:06,460
work on this because we also think it's

741
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:09,370
a pretty huge UX roadblock basically can

742
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,899
I thank you for answering that can you

743
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:15,580
can you get to the end of the line and

744
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:19,989
let somebody else thank you alright so I

745
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:22,049
tried out the recent tour private

746
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:24,279
browsing integration and brave recently

747
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,159
and I know it's still early but just

748
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,350
kind of curious from your point of view

749
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,149
in the future if like a browser vendor

750
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,190
like brave fully supports tor

751
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,779
integration in the proper way that

752
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,909
preserves all user privacy is there any

753
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,440
reason for a user to use tor browser

754
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,909
instead are there certain things that

755
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,990
just can't be accomplished unless you

756
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,990
have full control of the stack

757
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,080
I think the answer is no I think if

758
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:54,739
brave actually provides the same safety

759
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,680
guarantees as tor browser tries to then

760
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:00,919
it comes down to the same argument as to

761
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,129
why you choose chrome over Firefox or

762
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,890
you know various other arguments you

763
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:11,630
know it if both browsers have feature

764
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:15,230
parity then it's just a flame war

765
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:24,500
between which browser you choose I think

766
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:27,350
cool thanks good good afternoon or good

767
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:31,070
morning as the case may be I came out of

768
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,049
a the earlier presentation on Standing

769
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,630
Rock where they mentioned infiltrators

770
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,060
and I remember a while back one of my

771
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,660
friends posts sending me something about

772
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:44,630
how a basically a police department had

773
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,640
set up a tour relay have given any

774
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,290
consideration to the kind of measures to

775
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,600
make sure that people that are setting

776
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,460
up relays are not part of law

777
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,540
enforcement or shall we say other

778
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,540
apparatus of the state

779
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:07,940
okay so so so we have a team of

780
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,640
volunteer tor that does hunt down bad

781
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,770
relays and that bad relays I mean relays

782
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
that will hijack net hijack exit

783
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,530
connections relays that will RFS onion

784
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,210
addresses on the v2 on the version tube

785
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:24,410
and we we reject them from the network

786
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:28,100
there's 6500 relays right now there was

787
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,720
a time that we knew most of them 90% of

788
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,990
the relay operator will come to relay

789
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,970
operators at Congress or hope or in

790
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,310
DEFCON and so on so forth so we will

791
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:41,899
meet them now it went to a point where

792
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:47,420
we are much we have more discussion

793
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:48,920
right now in tor to try to control or

794
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,690
not control I would say but more of a

795
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,540
know who is coming in a network because

796
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,490
we have problems constant problem like

797
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,529
every single week we reject relays from

798
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,160
the network and sometimes we reject them

799
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,029
and

800
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,859
we just we it's by safety we see 60

801
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:05,059
relays coming in from Amazon the same

802
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:07,430
person they're the same the same

803
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:10,009
configuration the same version and so on

804
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:13,029
so forth and and we safely reject them

805
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:16,069
so I think the goal the the one of the

806
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:18,230
good approach we can take is try to no

807
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:19,640
more really operator try to be there for

808
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,829
the rail operator to try to make them

809
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,319
feel that they're part of the network so

810
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:26,150
we're sending them swag we talk to them

811
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,069
we appreciate them and so on so forth so

812
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,670
this is why also we have right now a

813
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:35,480
relay really advocate really his name is

814
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,059
Colin his his handle on IRC is full ph o

815
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,500
UL so there's a it's two-sided right

816
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,150
there's like the technical mitigations

817
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,279
and then there's the human side which is

818
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,359
of course no guarantee like you can meet

819
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:47,150
somebody and they can tell you that

820
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,578
they're not a cop but we think that

821
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,380
building communities of trust and

822
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:54,619
real-life relationships is one of the

823
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:59,630
best defenses against people who mean to

824
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:01,789
do us harm another thing I'd like to

825
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,130
mention is that like I'm a technical

826
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:07,480
side the threat model of Tor is already

827
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:10,250
taking into account that some relays are

828
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,799
potentially malicious and that's why the

829
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,150
path selection and the guard logic and

830
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:17,569
all these things are designed in a way

831
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:20,569
that does not like if n relays are

832
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:24,288
malicious it doesn't mean that the users

833
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:25,849
get owned you know like the design is

834
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:28,940
made in such a way that it's in the

835
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:31,819
threat model basically yeah so basically

836
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,319
if they if some law-enforcement wants to

837
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:35,029
run a couple of relays that's great I

838
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:40,430
mean it's just building network and

839
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:42,049
making it faster and better more useful

840
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,700
and hopefully that means we get more

841
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:45,500
users which means it's more difficult to

842
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,868
actually compromise and he's you know

843
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,269
particular user so you know a couple

844
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,069
relays is probably okay I mean if they

845
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:55,459
run half that's a problem but we would

846
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:57,259
pretty much know if if any entity or

847
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,960
group was running more than a couple

848
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:01,279
just to be clear if they did we it's

849
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,730
part of the threat model we assume that

850
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:07,279
they do and and if they do it still is

851
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,720
is doing the minimal amount of harm

852
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:11,150
based on what tors

853
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:21,140
model is so if you're a cop don't run a

854
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:23,390
relay that's my thing so I like your

855
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,520
effort towards privacy and onion izing

856
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,350
the whole internet I was wondering are

857
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,720
there classes of applications that you

858
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:31,670
would recommend not including in an

859
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,680
onion tight network or tor the Tor

860
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,470
network so for example maybe real-time

861
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,810
communications VoIP calls I don't know

862
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,430
do they have bad performance any type of

863
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:48,890
app you just suggest not doing within

864
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:51,049
tor yeah so torrenting is kind of the

865
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,120
default application now we don't want

866
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,830
for a couple reasons one because it adds

867
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,380
a lot of load on the network without

868
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,840
really much benefit to anyone except for

869
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:05,440
the person who's downloading stuff it

870
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:10,040
also in general leaks a lot of the local

871
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,510
end users location information there are

872
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,370
a few address and stuff and so it

873
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,340
generally basically doesn't provide that

874
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:18,230
user with the location privacy that they

875
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,520
were expecting so it's actually harmful

876
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:27,080
to them also in terms of other types of

877
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:29,000
applications I think if the application

878
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,520
takes into account that there is added

879
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,980
lesen latency within the connection

880
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,810
so maybe real-time communication will be

881
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,820
delayed by a second or two so you might

882
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:47,060
not want that but maybe something like a

883
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:49,280
record record audio for you know for

884
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,560
some time and then transmit it and then

885
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,270
wait for a recorded message back or

886
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,450
something like that

887
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:59,800
we are hoping that within the next year

888
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:02,810
or so tor browser will support WebRTC

889
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,340
and so I think that will be a very

890
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:09,680
interesting experiment to see how

891
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:12,680
real-time the tor network can be in

892
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,730
terms of communication but generally if

893
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:20,210
the application doesn't leak users

894
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:23,349
information without their consent then

895
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,390
most applications are okay and that's

896
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:27,800
this is basically white or has a

897
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,200
applications team because it actually

898
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,300
takes up almost a full team just to

899
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,160
audit large applications and make sure

900
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,599
that it's actually respecting the users

901
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,029
privacy but there's obviously a huge

902
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,550
amount of potential so if you have some

903
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,980
ideas you can definitely you know try it

904
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:52,339
out and you can let us know we'd

905
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:53,690
appreciate that awesome thanks hi thanks

906
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:56,509
so much for your work on the Tor project

907
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,760
we all really appreciate it I had a

908
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,559
question regarding an old project do you

909
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,690
you guys were supporting it was the hard

910
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,010
end or sandbox tor browser I thought

911
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,290
that was a very compelling project

912
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,540
albeit very hard for usability is there

913
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:13,910
any plan to roadmaps to include that in

914
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:18,220
the future so yes we're actually having

915
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:23,500
a meeting next Tuesday

916
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:25,819
1500 UTC I know cuz I scheduled it and

917
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,339
so we're going to be discussing how we

918
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:30,710
actually revive that project because

919
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:35,420
that was specifically for Linux and

920
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:38,240
specifically for users who had recent

921
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:41,900
versions of Linux and we are going to be

922
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,270
discussing how we actually built that

923
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,700
and integrate it into just normal tor

924
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:51,290
browser in the way that will potentially

925
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:53,359
be up streamed to Firefox but also not

926
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:57,980
only like specific but also covering Mac

927
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:01,700
OS X and Windows so we are discussing it

928
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,230
we don't have a hard plan yet but

929
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:08,529
hopefully within the next couple of

930
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,530
weeks we will awesome thanks

931
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,049
oh hi thanks for your work I want to

932
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,020
know do you have any recommendations for

933
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:22,790
the situation where my favorite website

934
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,990
doesn't accept tour connections so yes

935
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,730
honestly it seems like the best thing to

936
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,939
do is get in touch with the website we

937
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:33,870
actually have on our new support portal

938
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,300
we have some text about exactly this

939
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:39,690
situation that's like hey I'm a tour

940
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,300
user you know we care about human rights

941
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,310
and privacy and freedom online and stuff

942
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,300
you know maybe you weren't aware it's

943
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,710
very like gentle and friendly and hey

944
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,390
perhaps you didn't know that this was

945
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,520
happening or you didn't realize that

946
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,190
tour users are good people and will you

947
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,610
please unblock us we've had some success

948
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:02,130
with that and I think more hearing from

949
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,040
more users is certainly you know people

950
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,010
they want you to visit their website so

951
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,970
anything yeah like just being a human

952
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,940
being and getting in touch with other

953
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:14,730
human beings and being nice yeah being

954
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,960
nice and not being accusatory like how

955
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,280
dare you do this you know because

956
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,990
sometimes they don't know they gonna

957
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,990
find an open proxy entraining

958
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:28,380
forgiveness not permission I have a

959
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,109
question about the new websites that

960
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,870
you're developing do they have a like do

961
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,980
you test them with javascript disabled

962
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,630
yeah they all work with JavaScript

963
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:40,680
disabled does a great question for

964
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,990
example the Support Portal the if you

965
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,870
have JavaScript enabled you can like

966
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,270
expand the questions if you have

967
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:50,970
javascript disabled it's just a just

968
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:54,620
continuous text but it all works without

969
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,620
JavaScript great thank you

970
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:00,690
so you've mentioned so you've mentioned

971
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:02,460
and it's been mentioned elsewhere that

972
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,160
client applications that weren't

973
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,200
designed to be used with tor tend to

974
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,859
leak the users identity when used with

975
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,960
tor are is it still is there still any

976
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:16,049
point in using those applications with

977
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,819
tor or is it actually more dangerous to

978
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:26,579
use those applications with tor than

979
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:27,299
without I think it depends on the

980
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,519
application

981
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:34,979
so Firefox you absolutely should not use

982
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:36,718
vanilla Firefox with tor I think it's

983
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:41,129
just a case-by-case basis for basically

984
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:44,779
anything else there's a if using Linux

985
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:47,069
or UNIX like operating system there's

986
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:50,969
there's a program called tor socks which

987
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:52,579
will basically wrap a program that you

988
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:55,140
launch from the command line and

989
00:45:52,579 --> 00:46:00,239
basically pipe all of that traffic

990
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:03,150
through tor many people use that for for

991
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:08,969
example horrifying their their mail

992
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:11,479
client or or like a double you get or

993
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:16,019
you know just like very simple

994
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:17,609
applications that don't even really have

995
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:21,988
much identifying information or if they

996
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:25,348
do it's very constrained to what the

997
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:27,779
user already knows that application has

998
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:32,239
and will give whether that's just like a

999
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:34,799
login information or something but I

1000
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:38,880
think if you're confident that the

1001
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:40,319
application won't leak anything cuz it

1002
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,450
doesn't have anything then that's fine

1003
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:49,109
if it's a more complicated application

1004
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:51,598
then you should be careful hello thank

1005
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,038
you for your work and your panel I was

1006
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,170
hoping to hear from hopefully everyone

1007
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,089
at the table for each department what is

1008
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,859
your greatest challenge moving forward

1009
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,930
with tor I'm particularly interested in

1010
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:04,369
community outreach in bridging that gap

1011
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,368
into the more mainstream

1012
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,550
I think reaching new people and kind of

1013
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,009
combating a negative perception that

1014
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:17,079
people have but in my experience so far

1015
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,210
as long as you can have that

1016
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,550
conversation the conversation does go

1017
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,770
well so it's just related to community

1018
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:28,030
reaching those new people is a is a

1019
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:29,800
challenge and communication I think you

1020
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,079
know just very similar to what Steph

1021
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,579
said there are a lot of people in the

1022
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,619
world they speak many languages and

1023
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:40,869
visiting them in in communicating with

1024
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:43,059
them in real time presents its own

1025
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:47,069
challenges with things like time zones

1026
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:49,660
and and travel and such so it's it's a

1027
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:52,839
it's not an insurmountable challenge but

1028
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,819
it certainly is a big task to if we want

1029
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:58,569
everyone in the world to be using tor

1030
00:47:54,819 --> 00:48:01,569
and we do just making the space to meet

1031
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:04,540
who those people are and also getting

1032
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:06,400
enough relays to support the network and

1033
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,099
make it fast and usable for all the new

1034
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,540
people and we do just have one one

1035
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:16,210
minute left in terms of network raising

1036
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,130
the network and making it scale well in

1037
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,500
terms of number of relays and number of

1038
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,839
users is extremely important to us as

1039
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,720
well as like fundamental issues with low

1040
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:28,029
latency anonymity that attacks that can

1041
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:35,470
happen that we even don't know how to

1042
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:38,049
solve exactly so I think it's a lot of

1043
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,578
what Alison and stuff I already

1044
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:42,849
mentioned but also on the application

1045
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:45,220
side I think reaching users that don't

1046
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:49,140
have desktops I think Mobile is a huge

1047
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:51,848
region into that area and I think

1048
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:55,240
testing and making sure tor works on

1049
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:57,630
networks that are really shitty and just

1050
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,680
like mobile networks in many areas have

1051
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,450
extremely high latency and packet loss

1052
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,460
and making sure tor is actually usable

1053
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:06,578
on those networks will be really really

1054
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,990
good stuff okay thank you very much if

1055
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:10,150
you have any more questions you can

1056
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:15,279
visit us at our booth or join us on

1057
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:17,760
piracy Stef make one quick yeah George

1058
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,520
disembodied voice work

1059
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,220
um I was gonna I wanted to apply real

1060
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,870
quick if I may to the comment about

1061
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,029
access and tour being blocked by

1062
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:32,080
websites and then one other quick thing

1063
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:35,260
is that all right anyway you've got 30

1064
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,910
seconds part part of the problem is that

1065
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,050
websites are blocking because they don't

1066
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,509
know what they're doing and they need to

1067
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,710
be told to stop doing it unfortunately

1068
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,270
there's also those who rely on

1069
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,120
surveillance and the in data collection

1070
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:48,220
so that's a hard argument the easier

1071
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,839
argument to make though is accessibility

1072
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,669
if corporate networks are blocking

1073
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,620
websites if countries are blocking

1074
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,630
websites that's why they need to allow

1075
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,580
tor and I think that's the technical

1076
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,890
argument to make that can be convincing

1077
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,480
the last thing is Alison mentioned the

1078
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,819
Tor meetups we actually have one in New

1079
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,850
York on August 2nd where Isabella the

1080
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:09,190
new executive director will be speaking

1081
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:11,290
so the location is it totally set yet

1082
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,290
but it's probably an NYU poly for

1083
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,730
anybody in in New York thank you he's

1084
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,940
allowed to do a comment because he's

1085
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,740
part of Tor project or some good shout

1086
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,200
out and thank you everyone thank you to

1087
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,810
the panel next up is secure drop in ten

1088
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,618
minutes

1089
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:28,619
[Applause]
