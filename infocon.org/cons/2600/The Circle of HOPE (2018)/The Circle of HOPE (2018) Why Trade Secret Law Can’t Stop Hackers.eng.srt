1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,550
good evening so I am Edie Ryan I am by

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,000
trade and intellectual property attorney

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,799
I mostly do patent work but this is a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,948
talk about trade secret law which is

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:21,930
kind of a complement to patents so since

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,279
I'm a lawyer there are certain standards

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,750
disclaimers I am NOT your lawyer and

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,070
there is exactly one piece of legal

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,059
advice that I will give you in this

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:37,620
entire talk which is do not crime the

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,718
remainder of the talk is not legal

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,059
advice in any way even if you ask me a

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,920
question and I answer it it is not

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,218
intended to be legal advice it's just an

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,469
academic exploration of the topic of

16
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:52,110
trade secrets and towards that end if

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,190
you ask a question and it has to do with

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,230
a specific set of circumstances

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,570
please frame it as a hypothetical and

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,398
don't use the first person because this

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,500
is recorded and streamed and I don't

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:11,520
want you to get in trouble so the the

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,930
basic thrust of this talk trade secrets

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,070
are a kind of intellectual property

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,850
similar in certain ways to patents

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,100
trademarks copyrights but they have some

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,740
really weird properties that that will

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,839
come out to you because they also have

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:35,369
an interplay with with the criminal law

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,189
and search and seizure issues as it says

31
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,950
their trade secret law provides for

32
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,720
warrantless searches and seizures which

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,659
is not to say there's no due process and

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,399
it's actually pretty difficult but but

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:54,270
that is one surprising result of

36
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:57,930
misappropriating a trade secret it is my

37
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,689
personal opinion that the protections

38
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,880
that trade secret law provides to trade

39
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:08,220
secret owners are inadequate towards

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,140
addressing potential threats from third

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,490
party intrusion but say

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,489
and this will become more clear as we go

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,680
on but most trade secret theft and

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,290
misappropriation happens kind of within

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,740
a company an employee leaves they take

46
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:30,329
stuff with them they get sued it's not

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:33,810
really designed for the the the rogue

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,840
actor so here's a quick comparison

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,890
between trade secrets and and patents

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,280
which I think most people are more

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:46,649
familiar with the the core advantage of

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,920
a trade secret over a patent is that it

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,050
has an indefinite term whereas a patent

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,208
has a fixed lifetime if you maintain

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,150
that secret and keep it well it will

56
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,430
stay your trade secret until the end of

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,810
time you know coca-cola has had its

58
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:06,570
trade secret formula for many many many

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:12,750
years and they don't show any signs of

60
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:14,370
letting that go are who allowed to use

61
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,290
it for what drugs I mean you know could

62
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,390
could you do me a favor and hold it

63
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,799
until the end so that I can keep a good

64
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,290
flow going because I actually don't know

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,780
how long where I am going to land

66
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:31,079
timewise trade secret law requires that

67
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,180
you make reasonable efforts to keep your

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,730
secret a secret which is to say you know

69
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,230
if you you know leave a folder sitting

70
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,630
on a table and somebody comes by and

71
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,310
flips through the folder they haven't

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,390
necessarily misappropriated your trade

73
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,690
secret because you really weren't

74
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,630
keeping it a secret and so the the

75
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,890
question of what is a reasonable effort

76
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,390
depends on a lot of factors depends on

77
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,980
the nature of the secret how big your

78
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,619
company is you know what you can really

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,060
put forth but meanwhile a patent just

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,920
gives you a an absolute monopoly and in

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,500
exchange all of that material is

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,839
published so there is no secret and

83
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,890
therefore no efforts required to

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,690
maintain the secret and the next step

85
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,108
the the trade secret you don't have to

86
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,969
do anything to to go and get recognition

87
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,599
for it in fact because it's a secret

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,560
recognition would be an issue versus a

89
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:27,780
patent which has a lengthy and expensive

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,180
application process so what it boils

91
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,030
down to is in some cases where as

92
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,260
patents are kind of the gold standard of

93
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,770
intellectual property and provide you

94
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,430
know extremely strong protection trade

95
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:46,820
secrets have an advantage in their in

96
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:51,890
their long lifetime and relatively

97
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:54,450
inexpensive way of of maintaining them

98
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,659
so when we're talking about trade secret

99
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,490
law we're actually talking about 51

100
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,100
different laws each state has its own

101
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:09,030
trade secret law and then the federal

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:13,440
government as of 2016 has an updated and

103
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:15,690
and pretty thorough trade secret law new

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,940
york interestingly is one of the two

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,300
states in the Union that does not have

106
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,790
that does not follow the in a general

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,110
sense the unifor uniform trade secret

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:31,200
Act everything else is is pretty much

109
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,600
along those lines including the federal

110
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,640
defense trade Secrets Act so I'm going

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,800
to be focusing on the federal law

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,150
because by and large most states do

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,910
conform to that but what's going to

114
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,429
happen is if you ever end up having to

115
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,790
deal with this each state is going to

116
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:56,430
have its own little quirks relative to

117
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:58,640
that that federal system and one thing

118
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,380
to note is that the federal economic

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,700
Espionage Act which is much older going

120
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,130
back to the 90s also plays a role but

121
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,719
but is not really the focus of the talk

122
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:14,600
pardon sorry so here we have the

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,160
definition of a trade secret

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,540
the term trade secret means I'm leaning

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,920
over because my notes aren't showing up

126
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:28,560
on my computer so okay the first step as

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,960
I mentioned before the trade secret

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,290
owner has to take reasonable efforts to

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,900
maintain that secret and then that

130
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,290
information that is being kept seek

131
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,530
has to be valuable and not just valuable

132
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,330
but valuable because it is secret so

133
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,890
that is to say if you were you know it

134
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,690
gives you some competitive advantage

135
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,940
that if it were released out into the

136
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,590
world you would no longer have that

137
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,620
advantage either because everybody else

138
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,130
could do it or because they know you

139
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,950
because they know how you do it it is

140
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,040
less pertinent and this comes up a lot

141
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,240
in a wide variety of different kinds of

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,180
information you know it's not just

143
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,780
source code or you know the design of

144
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,020
some device it comes out in like

145
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,200
customer lists you know potential

146
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,659
prospects for salespeople and these

147
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:30,479
people you know anything then any

148
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:36,060
basically any kind of technical aids

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:39,000
secret and and it's really important to

150
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,820
emphasize that the secrecy of the trade

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,020
secret is key the moment that is

152
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:50,210
released out into the wild that trade

153
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:54,359
secret has lost a lot of its value and

154
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,520
and what can actually happen is if that

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,500
gets inadvertently released you lose the

156
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,479
ability to use the ability to seek

157
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,340
damages for somebody who misappropriates

158
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,040
it because at that point the secret is

159
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,070
no longer a secret what ends up

160
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,110
happening then is a lot of the lawsuits

161
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,290
for trade secret enforcement are

162
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,930
backwards looking the breach has already

163
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,450
occurred the the misappropriation has

164
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,760
already taken place and the trade secret

165
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,210
owner assuming there's even a trade

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,719
secret

167
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,630
anymore is looking to be made whole

168
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,010
right it's a civil lawsuit where they're

169
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,010
looking for their damages

170
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,730
so the first example that I want to

171
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,380
bring to your attention is one you may

172
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,940
be familiar with depending on how long

173
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:52,220
you've been in this scene but DCSS was a

174
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,320
tool that was it was part of how well

175
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,470
the the fundamental trade secret was

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,740
part of how DVDs were played and so when

177
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,820
the DVD standard was was created DVDs

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,850
were encoded with this CSS encoding

179
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,700
scheme in order to prevent third party

180
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:14,510
unauthorized playback

181
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:18,200
I don't now that made it possible for

182
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,630
people to make software DVD players but

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,710
you had to pay a license in order to get

184
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:28,820
the authorized CSS codes it was reverse

185
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,950
engineered and we'll talk more about

186
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,160
reverse engineering later but what ended

187
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,940
up happening was when the person who

188
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,880
reverse engineered it downloaded the DVD

189
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,400
player software they clicked on an

190
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,090
end-user license agreement that forbade

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,459
them from reverse engineering and in a

192
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,520
sense that created a duty that they

193
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,520
broke when they reverse engineered it

194
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,910
that happened in Norway would see if I

195
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:08,240
had that right yes the author of the

196
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,500
software was in Norway so that the DVD

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,020
copy control association had no

198
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,030
jurisdiction over them there was no way

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,540
for them to get their their their money

200
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,000
out of the Norway defendant so they what

201
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:28,189
they did was they sued Americans who had

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,760
reposted the DVD the DCSS software that

203
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:36,200
made it possible for anybody to write a

204
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:40,700
third party unauthorized DVD player and

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,440
that trial well that that case lasted

206
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,290
for several years and was eventually

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,000
dismissed it was in California this was

208
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,560
before the defender trade secrets act

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,340
happened so it was all based in state

210
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,810
law

211
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,350
and it bounced up and you know up and

212
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:57,160
down the California appeals courts until

213
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,900
it was found that because by the time

214
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,930
this lawsuit was instituted in

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,410
California everybody already knew about

216
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,219
DCSS the cat was out of the bag and so

217
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:13,880
there was no trade secret to sue about

218
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,760
they the the DVD CCA asserted that these

219
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,920
people who were redistributing the DCSS

220
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,380
software were misappropriating their

221
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,120
trade secrets but the courts have

222
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,800
concluded that there was actually at

223
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,900
that point no trade secret left at all

224
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,530
so I keep using the word

225
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:37,030
misappropriation the the statute

226
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:40,339
actually creates a distinction between

227
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,380
misappropriation and theft where theft

228
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,840
of a trade secret is criminal and

229
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,689
misappropriation of a trade secret is

230
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:53,120
civil misappropriate and they very

231
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:55,730
similar in their in their application so

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
the key of misappropriation is about the

233
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,140
means by which this information was

234
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,410
acquired because there are proper means

235
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,949
of acquiring information and there are

236
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:09,530
improper means of acquiring information

237
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:13,840
and I have here it includes theft

238
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:17,270
bribery misrepresentation so fraud

239
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,780
breach or inducement to breach of a duty

240
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,030
to maintain secrecy which goes to you

241
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,709
know the the promise that person made in

242
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,280
when they clicked on their end user

243
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:30,980
License Agreement or espionage through

244
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,920
electronic or other means which I think

245
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,850
is most pertinent to the the current

246
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,829
environment but it can also mean

247
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:46,790
acquiring this trade secret information

248
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:51,020
when you know or had reason to know that

249
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:53,540
the information was itself acquired by

250
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,630
improper means so this starts to

251
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,189
establish kind of a chain right and and

252
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,570
goes back to the DCSS question well if

253
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,810
the people who had

254
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:09,870
reposted DCSS known that it was acquired

255
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:14,329
through improper means were they also

256
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:17,630
liable in that sense for acquiring

257
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,830
misappropriated trade secret information

258
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,160
for whatever reason the court in that

259
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,950
case decided no that it was enough

260
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,649
public that the trade secret was

261
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:32,279
dissolved before the misappropriation

262
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:34,080
took place by those third parties and I

263
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,089
think that the the standard of knowledge

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,120
here's is very interesting because it is

265
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:40,589
have reason to know and that's very

266
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,899
different from what you find in the law

267
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,839
a lot of time which is known or should

268
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,839
have known right which implies a certain

269
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,720
duty to go out and and do your own

270
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,510
homework if you if it's required that

271
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,540
you have reason to know that means a

272
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,950
higher standard that you know the

273
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,130
information was on my desk

274
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,200
I just didn't look at it and I think

275
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,220
that that helps create some room then

276
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,260
for those downstream users in terms of

277
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,390
plausible deniability as long as it

278
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,660
nobody's screaming in their face I stole

279
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,339
this they can make a credible argument

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,300
that they had no reason to know that it

281
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,310
was stolen and that leads me into my

282
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,949
next example which is the more recent

283
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:29,819
case of way mo versus uber which brought

284
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,380
in a lot of trade secret stuff in the

285
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,420
the general background for anyone who's

286
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,740
not familiar is there were employees of

287
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,620
way mo or alphabet at the time or the

288
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,120
boundaries there are fuzzy to me they've

289
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,700
left to start their own company their

290
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,100
own self-driving car company that was

291
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,079
within six months bought by uber I think

292
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,970
you know my understanding is that it was

293
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:55,500
a a founding of a company with the

294
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,000
explicit intention of having it

295
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,850
immediately bought up by uber as a

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,160
matter of their negotiations one or more

297
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,920
of those employees left with tens of

298
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,969
thousands of documents relating to way

299
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,819
Mo's technology and the way that this

300
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,660
came to light was that one of way most

301
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,270
manufacturers came to them of their own

302
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,300
accord

303
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:21,010
and said hey uber just wanted us to

304
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,829
build this thing that looks exactly like

305
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,810
your thing which throws up all the red

306
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:31,630
flags whammo and is the beginning of a

307
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:33,310
lawsuit the the proceed the the amount

308
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,330
of information that came out in this

309
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,780
trial was kind of was kind of hilarious

310
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,340
lots of really sketchy conversations

311
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:46,120
people talking about shredding and

312
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,920
destroying evidence laptops were wiped

313
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,520
and and it's interesting to note that

314
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,680
that's always a key indicator of a trade

315
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,230
secret misappropriation when you win a

316
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,560
when a wipe to laptop turns up in one of

317
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,940
these investigations but I think it

318
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,719
raises an interesting question now of

319
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,450
who exactly did the misappropriating the

320
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,100
first guy his name was Levin douse key

321
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:13,630
who left Google with all the documents I

322
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,570
think there's a very good argument there

323
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,760
you know this this all kind of got swept

324
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,470
under the rug when it's settled

325
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,880
but based on the evidence that had come

326
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,610
out already there was a pretty good

327
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,570
argument there that he had

328
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,820
misappropriated a substantial amount of

329
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:32,260
information from Weymouth uh there was a

330
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,700
quick question as to whether he owned

331
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,580
the information and now when you work

332
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,140
for an employer and you produce

333
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,670
information for that employer in the

334
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,220
course of your employment

335
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,410
generally speaking the employer owns

336
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,240
that information particularly when you

337
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,319
have an employment agreement or contract

338
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,010
with them that says that you have these

339
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,710
responsibilities with respect to the

340
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,890
information I think the more interesting

341
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,170
question is did Buber misappropriate

342
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,260
trade secrets and that goes to whether

343
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,200
uber knew or should have not should have

344
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,760
known knew or had reason to know that

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,310
Levin dowse Key had done this and that

346
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,010
whether he had brought it to uber with

347
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,879
him and I think that the record was much

348
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,660
less clear at least by the time the case

349
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,330
settled and so then the next question

350
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,010
would be all right let's assume there is

351
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,698
misappropriation what are the damages

352
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,410
for it the types of damages for

353
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:33,340
misappropriation come down

354
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,130
two basically two options actual damages

355
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,100
or a reasonable royalty and I find the

356
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,470
reasonable royalty option kind of

357
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,030
interesting because it's basically so

358
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,570
let's talk about actual damages first

359
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,030
actual damages refer to the losses an in

360
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,530
value caused by the divulging of this

361
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,960
trade secret so if you've got something

362
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,310
some valuable secret information now

363
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,170
everybody knows it

364
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,730
you've lost your competitive advantage

365
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,170
whatever it was that that secret

366
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,540
provided you and it also provides for

367
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,560
recouping the unjust enrichment by the

368
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,659
Miss appropriator

369
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,340
so somebody steals your trade secret

370
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,170
they go off and they make your thing and

371
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,169
they're making their own profits on your

372
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,850
thing you would be able to get back that

373
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,710
unjust enrichment that they otherwise

374
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,199
would not have gotten if they hadn't

375
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,360
taken your trade secret whereas a

376
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,860
reasonable royalty and and these are

377
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,080
alternatives it's only one or the other

378
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,540
actual damages or a reasonable royalty a

379
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,060
reasonable royalty comes out with like

380
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,860
now we're friends now we have a business

381
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,260
relationship and I am paying you for

382
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,439
something and able to go on and continue

383
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,150
to make it which you know comes up a lot

384
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,010
in the patent world as well but in this

385
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:50,040
case where there was kind of a clear bad

386
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:53,560
act let's say I find that to be an odd

387
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,950
and odd remedy because now these people

388
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,540
have an ongoing relationship and then

389
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,840
there's also one more quirk which is

390
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,520
when the misappropriation is willful and

391
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,740
malicious and who knows what that means

392
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,900
[Music]

393
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,810
it's not it's not a question of level of

394
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,860
proof it's it's got to do with the

395
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:17,200
whatever was done to misappropriate it

396
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,600
deals with the acts the improper means

397
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,880
of the misappropriation so maybe it's

398
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,449
like you know you you went in there with

399
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,680
a crowbar

400
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,480
and and got the trade secret that would

401
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,170
be cause for double damages short of

402
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,500
that I really don't know what that what

403
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:38,140
that implies so now that we've got a

404
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,740
good framework for understanding the

405
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,300
basics of trade secrets I think that one

406
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,560
of the more interest

407
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,080
applications that comes out of the

408
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,530
defend trade secrets Act the federal act

409
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,030
comes to civil seizures and this is what

410
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,300
I've referred to earlier when I talked

411
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,780
about warrantless search and seizure

412
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:01,790
which if you are you know up on your

413
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:07,700
constitutional law sounds like a problem

414
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:14,290
with the Fourth Amendment we're so in

415
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:16,760
extreme situations and usually where the

416
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,420
further disclosure can still be

417
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:25,520
prevented it's possible to get a court

418
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:28,810
order that allows you know federal law

419
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,410
enforcement to enter your home and

420
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:36,580
retrieve whatever equipment or documents

421
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:40,970
are involved in this misappropriation

422
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,129
it's a very rare remedy and I think

423
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,190
there were only five yes only five that

424
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,940
have happened since this act was signed

425
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:52,490
in 2016 if we have time later I've got a

426
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,800
pretty detailed set of slides that go

427
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,410
into exactly what is required but it is

428
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,399
a high bar to meet and generally

429
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,950
requires like some kind of activity some

430
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,930
special kind of activity that makes the

431
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:09,890
court think oh we need to we need to get

432
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:12,950
this stuff right now so here are some

433
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,670
examples in one case the target ignored

434
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,720
the court orders that were sent to him

435
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,730
meleave the details were that he was

436
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,220
depressed from from having been

437
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:27,080
terminated at his job and was not

438
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:31,310
leaving his house in another the target

439
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,350
was he was he was just lying to the

440
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,740
other side into the court and so that

441
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,149
kind of behavior annoys courts and then

442
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,980
and yet another one the target had made

443
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,300
an overt threat regarding the trade

444
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,160
secret information and so in all of

445
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,399
these cases right there's something

446
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,370
there that makes it makes the court feel

447
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,770
like we can't just wait for this to play

448
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,770
out through its normal processes

449
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:02,250
and all of that sounds like a very

450
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,309
criminal kind of situation but the civil

451
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:08,250
SI seizure is a civil process there is a

452
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:11,040
criminal side to all of this which comes

453
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:15,540
out of originally the economic Espionage

454
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,270
Act in this situation the trade secret

455
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,090
has to be for something that's involved

456
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,340
with interstate commerce so it's not

457
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,550
enough interestingly to misappropriate

458
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:29,520
over state lines it has to do with the

459
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:33,149
content of the information right so if I

460
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,010
have if my trade secret in that that

461
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,990
we're looking at here is a list of

462
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,629
customers and all those list of

463
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,650
customers are in New York State and

464
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:46,230
somebody steals it from me in New York

465
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:49,230
State I can't go to the the federal

466
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:55,200
level and use the economic Espionage Act

467
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:59,100
for for criminal restitution it also has

468
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,290
to be to the economic benefit of someone

469
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,559
who is not the owner and with the

470
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,760
knowledge that it will injure the owner

471
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,940
through this misappropriation and I

472
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,850
think that one in particular is key it

473
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,390
says that the profit motive is required

474
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:18,000
in order to make this a criminal event

475
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,420
and if we're going to look at the

476
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,820
criminal penalties that are possible in

477
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:27,000
general we're talking about a fine

478
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:30,600
that's not defined in the statute and

479
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,070
prison for up to ten years which is a

480
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,320
very heavy felony as these things go

481
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,960
then if it's done in for a foreign agent

482
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,830
which is to say a foreign government or

483
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,800
some other kind of foreign power

484
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,409
the penalties go up it's a fine of up to

485
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,720
five million dollars and prison for up

486
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:57,630
to fifteen years so I'm going to go back

487
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:00,600
and say do not crime now when we're

488
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,730
talking about misappropriation and we're

489
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,240
talking about the improper means

490
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:08,110
involved there are some exceptions to

491
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,750
all of this and the first one is

492
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,149
is reverse engineering reverse

493
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:16,750
engineering as I'm sure you all know is

494
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,900
when you take a an existing product and

495
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,480
you figure out how it worked

496
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,460
now that product may be you know a

497
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,370
widget on your desk it may be a piece of

498
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,000
software but for whatever reason now the

499
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,739
person who made that product believes

500
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,570
that you have taken their trade secret

501
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,130
by figuring it out the fact that you

502
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:42,580
reverse engineered it from from the

503
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,429
actual thing takes it outside the realm

504
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,290
of improper means similarly if you if

505
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:50,230
you read arrived it all from scratch

506
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:58,168
that would be another example of proper

507
00:24:50,230 --> 00:25:01,870
means and then in certain jurisdictions

508
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:04,390
within the United States there they go

509
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:08,379
even further by saying that if it's

510
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,630
reverse engineer a bowl there's no trade

511
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,080
secret to be had there and there are

512
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,850
court decisions that that say

513
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,820
essentially that that even though this

514
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,949
person used improper means to get the

515
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,379
information the fact that there was a

516
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,049
product on the market that could be

517
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:32,200
reverse engineered was enough to defeat

518
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:34,809
the the trade secret lawsuit so and in

519
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,460
some cases the the court actually said

520
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:40,840
the moment you sell a product at all

521
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,490
although it might be very difficult to

522
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,260
reverse-engineer it would be reverse

523
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:48,910
engineer able and in those jurisdictions

524
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:52,390
then the sale of that product destroys

525
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:55,840
the trade secret because the logic is

526
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:58,750
that that skilled person can go out and

527
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,720
do their homework and put all of that

528
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,520
information together the question of

529
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,220
whether something is readily

530
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,168
ascertainable is is really a question of

531
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,450
fact though and in most jurisdictions

532
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:14,020
they they take a more nuanced approach

533
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:19,690
to it and figuring out what does readily

534
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:21,490
ascertainable mean and this this kind of

535
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,289
blanket exception for

536
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,409
potentially reverse engineer bill

537
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:28,330
doesn't apply another the other

538
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:31,480
prominent exception is the whistleblower

539
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,699
exception which grants immunity from

540
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,549
trade secret actions if the disclosure

541
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,789
is made to a government agent and solely

542
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:41,830
for the purpose of reporting or

543
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:45,640
investigating a suspected violation of

544
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,260
law and so that kind of takes us that

545
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,360
takes us out of the realm of your

546
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,299
Snowden's and your Chelsea Manning's

547
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,760
because those were not made to a

548
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:58,299
government agent it may have been for

549
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,600
the purpose of revealing with the intent

550
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:03,070
of revealing what they saw as misdeeds

551
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,240
but it's it's specifically to a

552
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,590
government agent for the purpose of a

553
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,210
reporting or investigating violation of

554
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,059
a law and if you don't have those key

555
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,919
features it doesn't count as

556
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:16,510
whistleblowing but I thought another

557
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,899
interesting little tidbit that comes out

558
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:23,230
of this is that employers are required

559
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:28,539
to tell their employees about the

560
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:30,039
whistleblowing immunity and I haven't

561
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:32,950
found anything limiting that there may

562
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,200
be you know decisions or other rules

563
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,809
that limit that but my understanding

564
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:43,409
just based on the bare reading of the

565
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:46,539
statute is that the every employer is is

566
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:52,299
therefore required to tell their

567
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:54,700
employees about this so that brings us

568
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:58,090
around to the question of hackers and

569
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:01,149
how all of this applies to hackers and

570
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,949
so we're gonna because every every talk

571
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,689
kind of takes a different view on what

572
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,340
exactly a hacker is I'm going to give

573
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,220
you my definition for the purpose of

574
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,629
this talk and trade secret law and we're

575
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,450
going to we're going to treat the word

576
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:17,470
hacker to mean a someone who is pursuing

577
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:25,020
an emphasis non criminal exploration and

578
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:29,590
finds a trade secret so now this may be

579
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,000
this may be accidental it may be you

580
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,480
know you are looking for one thing and

581
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,260
you find another thing but some one way

582
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,030
or another

583
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,650
you have found this trade secret and

584
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:43,300
we're going to leave aside for a moment

585
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:47,110
the question of whether the Computer

586
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:50,379
Crime Act was violated in accessing the

587
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:53,429
machines involved as I said earlier most

588
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,960
trade secret misappropriation happens by

589
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,780
employees either current employees or

590
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,280
former employees and these legal tools

591
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,870
that we've talked about really focus on

592
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,610
situations where you know what was taken

593
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:13,090
and you know who took it and they don't

594
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:16,449
provide strong utility against a

595
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:18,399
potentially anonymous person who is not

596
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:25,030
necessarily trying to make money off of

597
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:26,950
this trade secret themselves it also

598
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:33,190
leaves open the possibility that if you

599
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:35,920
don't have that that profit motive it's

600
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,500
difficult for and you're not bragging

601
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,980
about it I should say the downstream

602
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,140
user has less reason to know that this

603
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,510
was a truck you know a misappropriation

604
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,150
of a trade secret and so it makes it

605
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,820
very easy then to distribute this

606
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:59,170
information into the wild without it's

607
00:29:51,820 --> 00:30:01,419
incurring that downstream liability the

608
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:06,930
key then for the the hacker who is

609
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:09,190
trying to say liberate information or or

610
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,590
publicize something outside of the

611
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,800
whistleblower provisions is to do so as

612
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:17,350
anonymously as possible and to not tell

613
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,690
people that this information came by an

614
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:25,719
unauthorized access of someone's

615
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:28,150
computer intrical II also the lack of

616
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,000
profit motive takes it outside of the

617
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:35,860
realm of criminal penalties through

618
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,010
economic espionage act do to do to do I

619
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,090
just mentioned the whistleblower stuff

620
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,400
which I guess if you're comfortable

621
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,679
talking to government agents and haven't

622
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,830
broken any laws in the process that

623
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,920
would be a viable

624
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:53,980
[Music]

625
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:56,110
strategy it also comes down to a

626
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:00,130
question of investigation and difficulty

627
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:02,020
in ID you know proving the case right so

628
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,270
because the hacker is not directly

629
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,650
associated with the company that theft

630
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,360
is much harder to trace

631
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,580
you know a lot of the times it really is

632
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,209
we saw you on camera walking out with a

633
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:16,000
laptop give us back the laptop if it's a

634
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,750
hacker with a third you know a remote

635
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,270
intrusion who is just downloading stuff

636
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,980
over the Internet

637
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,230
they're going to have to do a much more

638
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,830
thorough job in figuring out exactly who

639
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,830
that person is

640
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,320
so yeah that is the that is the ultimate

641
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,420
thesis here which is that a hacker who

642
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,210
is seeking only to limit liber8

643
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:44,830
information without necessarily trying

644
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,220
to resell it to Russia or whichever

645
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:51,970
other bad actor you'd like to imagine

646
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:57,310
the the law doesn't provide a lot of

647
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,770
effective tools for dealing with that so

648
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,710
that is the that's the bulk of the talk

649
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:06,100
I do have more information as well about

650
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,340
civil seizure and this is going to get

651
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:12,040
into what's required to get a civil

652
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,470
seizure and the general circumstances of

653
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,629
them the first key point is that a civil

654
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:22,390
seizure is ex parte which is lawyer for

655
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,640
only one side is involved so the trade

656
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:29,290
secret owner now is going to the court

657
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,260
by themselves to make this case and the

658
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:35,530
the target of the seizure has no ability

659
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,760
to have their voice heard it's available

660
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:41,290
for extraordinary circumstances and

661
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,110
provides for the seizure of property

662
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:46,270
that is specifically necessary to

663
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:49,209
prevent the propagation or dissemination

664
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:53,139
of the trade secret so this is like I

665
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:56,590
said earlier this is a that trade secret

666
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,170
holders use in order to prevent this

667
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:02,990
information from getting out any further

668
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:06,320
the first requirement is that there is

669
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:10,010
no other remedy that would solve this

670
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,460
problem in particular because the party

671
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:16,760
is planning to or showing that they are

672
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:21,020
not going to comply with whatever due

673
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,330
process results in and that immediate

674
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,670
and irreparable injury to the trade

675
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,189
secret owner will occur so basically

676
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:32,390
this boils down the fact to the fact

677
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:35,480
that the misappropriate er is going to

678
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,880
release this information and if we don't

679
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:43,790
stop them now we're going to miss our

680
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:48,710
chance the harm to the there there's

681
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:52,850
also a balance of harms here the harm to

682
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:56,570
the trade secret owner has to outweigh

683
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:59,300
the harm to the miss appropriator and in

684
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,550
addition has to substantially outweigh

685
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,470
any harm to any third parties involved

686
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,490
so if they have to break you know if

687
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,320
they're trying to get into your

688
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,540
apartment and they have to break through

689
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,719
three doors to get there not all of

690
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,029
which you own they have to you know make

691
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,949
it much higher showing that this

692
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,450
disruption not just to you but to the

693
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:21,739
people around you is is legitimate they

694
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,889
have to show not only that but a

695
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,928
likelihood of success when it eventually

696
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,480
goes through trial they essentially have

697
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,330
to prove their case right off the bat

698
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,310
and prove that you know - that that

699
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,639
judge again without any you know

700
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:40,429
feedback from the other side that

701
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,230
they're going to win and they have to

702
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,370
also show that the target they have to

703
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,770
provide evidence that the target

704
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,409
actually has this trade secret and kind

705
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:54,770
of the nature of the material and and

706
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:56,870
what it's embodied in you have to

707
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,580
describe the objects with some

708
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:02,810
specificity you can't just say yeah he's

709
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:05,120
got it go get it and we have to show

710
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,590
that the target would destroy move hide

711
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,720
or otherwise make such matter

712
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,630
inaccessible to the court if they had

713
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,129
notice which is to say we have to give

714
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,440
you give the court a reason to

715
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:19,460
believe that if we told them what we

716
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,029
were doing they would ruin everything

717
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,650
and finally the trade secret owner

718
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:26,299
cannot publicize this request which

719
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,720
seems a little redundant to me but it's

720
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:32,900
there in the statute in addition to all

721
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,089
of those stated requirements the objects

722
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,660
to be seized have to be described and an

723
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:42,619
expert goes along with the federal

724
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:45,078
agents to make sure that the things that

725
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:48,500
are taken are the things that are asked

726
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,569
for so in the case of you know

727
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,940
computerized information things stored

728
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:55,579
on a hard drive that expert is going to

729
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,980
go there and make sure that the

730
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:01,269
information is stored on this hard drive

731
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,130
and we're going to take this hard drive

732
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:07,038
interestingly also the statute provides

733
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,099
that if the seizure is improper for

734
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:15,950
whatever reason the target then gets to

735
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:19,730
sue for damages from the the trade

736
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:22,490
secret owner so if they you know get a

737
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,829
little too hasty and and this was it

738
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:28,508
turns out not justified at all they get

739
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:28,509
to be compensated for that

740
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,359
all right so if there are any questions

741
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,259
I would be happy to take them we've got

742
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:46,420
a microphone in the middle of the floor

743
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:50,799
please use that so that your question

744
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,710
gets put on the record and also I can't

745
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:56,469
see you so if you're hoping that I will

746
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:04,359
point to you that's not a possibility

747
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:08,049
yes come on okay

748
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:12,219
you mentioned specifically seizure of

749
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:17,890
software how does that way in comparison

750
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:20,920
with the recent Allis decision and the

751
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:23,890
challenging now of all software related

752
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,509
patents that could be performed the

753
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:30,598
calculations performed by the human mind

754
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:32,829
or expressions of laws of nature and the

755
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:37,960
applicability of that to basically

756
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:42,369
anything that runs sequential steps in a

757
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,680
piece of hardware so the short answer is

758
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:47,920
there is no real relevance because this

759
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,868
is a different area of the law we're

760
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,599
talking about trade secrets here versus

761
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,039
patent law and Alice was the the CLS

762
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,200
benek versus Alice decision was

763
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,499
specifically a patent decision and I

764
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,859
could talk to you for hours about that

765
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:05,799
the the quick answer on the patent side

766
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:08,920
is that Alice did not outlaw software

767
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:13,288
patents and in fact we get lots of

768
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:16,329
software patents every day the the

769
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:18,339
applicability to to this situation is

770
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,900
pretty mantener because one way or the

771
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,029
other

772
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,160
information that belongs to one person

773
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:26,380
was misappropriated by another person

774
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,460
and whether that information is a list

775
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,440
of customers or you know a list of of

776
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:38,109
software instructions it doesn't really

777
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:40,960
make a difference on this scale hi hello

778
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:42,759
I have one quick procedural question on

779
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,700
civil seizure today's second

780
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:47,170
hypothetical question okay

781
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,049
procedurally on on the civil seizure

782
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,390
provision

783
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,840
what is the burden of proof on the party

784
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,040
seeking civil seizure is it 51% sort of

785
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,680
preponderance or is there a higher

786
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,820
standard applied for this that is a good

787
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,129
question that I don't know off the top

788
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:06,950
of my head my guess is that it is a

789
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:09,860
convince a judge level of proof aren't

790
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,870
they and that you know ultimately

791
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,130
certain certain of those requirements

792
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,350
are going you know there's going to be

793
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,240
some sloshing back and forth between the

794
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,620
weight that those different requirements

795
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,470
are given you know if these

796
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,390
circumstances are really egregious and

797
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,750
you know the guys is flipping off the

798
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,839
courts it's more likely that they will

799
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,800
require less proof of the other more the

800
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,830
other requirements like in the case of

801
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,950
you know the guy who just ignored the

802
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,180
court orders that came in

803
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,460
eventually the court has to do something

804
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,750
and so even if those other requirements

805
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,310
are not really met the court is just

806
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,610
going to believe the guy who's standing

807
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:52,160
there versus the guy who's not and is

808
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,920
belligerently not to to the judges eye

809
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,180
and then a little more hypothetically if

810
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,550
I'm understanding the exceptions

811
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,529
correctly if this is something that a

812
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:03,830
third party finds and has no reason to

813
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:09,140
know was sort of illegally taken or

814
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:12,799
hacked out of the trade secret holders

815
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,200
possession that is accepted from this

816
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,210
law right that wouldn't that would not

817
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,700
rise to the level of misappropriation

818
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,160
right misappropriation has two

819
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,080
categories it's you did it yourself you

820
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,270
you you did the misappropriating

821
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,830
yourself you're the dirty misappropriate

822
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:32,210
er or you got it from the guy or you got

823
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,680
it from the guy who got it from the guy

824
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:38,300
right there's got to be some chain of

825
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,270
knowledge there where you know or add

826
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,670
reason to know that this stuff is dirty

827
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,900
and in other cases I guess the main

828
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,360
question is are there cases sort of

829
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,630
loosed it in how much knowledge needs to

830
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,700
be had ie you know obvious treem cases

831
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:55,190
are pretty easy are there any cases on

832
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,799
the middle ground where I found it on

833
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,840
paste bin and there's like some hacking

834
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,100
teams logo on the top but it doesn't say

835
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,570
we stole this

836
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,140
right are there cases talking about that

837
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,820
kind of fuzzy line I don't know what you

838
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,470
know I don't know if there is direct

839
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,080
case law on the level of knowledge

840
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,430
required there probably is but

841
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,100
ultimately that's going to be this sort

842
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,830
of thing that's a question of fact

843
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,660
whether this person had enough knowledge

844
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:25,029
that the jury will decide on so it's

845
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:29,089
going to be kind of tough to find

846
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:32,360
instances where you know not you it's

847
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:33,590
not get to to lawyer Lee about it there

848
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,120
there will probably it will probably be

849
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,640
relatively rare that you find cases

850
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,589
directly on point for that Thanks

851
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:47,210
oh great is my turn

852
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:50,060
Barney oh oh great it's my turn

853
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,400
yes so the gold standard you spoke of

854
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,410
with patents means what

855
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,260
well that's coming from a patent

856
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:00,470
attorney I like to think that patents

857
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,700
are the best which is an unpopular

858
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:08,270
opinion around here the the gold secret

859
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,669
clearance I don't so you've got more

860
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,310
secrets than I do I know but what you

861
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,770
were saying like before that you said

862
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:17,900
the gold standard right so so what I

863
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,250
meant ins what I meant when I said that

864
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:25,310
is that the level of protection that is

865
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:29,420
provided by a patent is very strong it

866
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:32,180
is it is very easy to take a patent and

867
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:36,770
use it like you know contending lasts

868
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:39,200
more because of that can pending lassen

869
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:43,250
pending like that impending last longer

870
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,189
because of what so there is an interplay

871
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:49,640
there between trade secret law and and

872
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:53,210
the patent system where the courts are

873
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:57,020
very leery of allowing people to sort of

874
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:00,890
use trade secret law to artificially

875
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:02,960
extend the life of their patents the so

876
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,029
it's basically it boils down to if

877
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,940
you've been using this trade secret for

878
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,610
decades and then it gets out you can't

879
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,490
suddenly file a patent for that because

880
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,690
that would be essentially getting all

881
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:20,649
those decades plus

882
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:20,650
or 20 years of patent term thank you

883
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:27,259
thanks I really value this information

884
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,980
about the state of the law I'm also kind

885
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,930
of concerned about like how from one

886
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,119
point of view but the issues you've

887
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:40,430
described or just a loophole that needs

888
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:44,359
to be fixed in the law and the and I I

889
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:46,160
mean you're right that's it's that in

890
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:47,810
with the current state of law it's they

891
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,319
assume you're right the hacker can

892
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:53,660
liberate information but what we've seen

893
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,339
in other areas the law is laws that

894
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,500
originally just covered people and

895
00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:01,339
terrorist groups were extended to

896
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,920
so-called lone wolf terrorists and in

897
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:05,750
the same way you could see the Congress

898
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,700
deciding that they need to extend the

899
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,030
law to make sure that people can't just

900
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,379
liberate trade secrets and so that's

901
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,290
more of a political question than a

902
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,170
legal question I'm trying to figure out

903
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:22,069
well okay as a political matter how do

904
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:24,470
we stop Congress from from changing the

905
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:28,099
law on this and the only thing I can

906
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:30,950
think of is maybe that we have to show

907
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:34,339
that the people in Congress that state

908
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,950
and in the public that state that people

909
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:40,940
liberating information like this leads

910
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,529
to more economic benefits and then

911
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,369
keeping it bottled up in the hands of

912
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:46,099
the monopolist

913
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:47,569
but it seems awkward to do that even

914
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:48,650
with the law in its current state so I

915
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:50,180
was wondering what kind of thoughts you

916
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:53,480
have about that so I think you're right

917
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,160
that it is a political question and it

918
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,530
comes down to a question of policy and

919
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,980
the policies go both ways right there is

920
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:05,260
a sort of general policy kind of a

921
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:08,980
concept of economic fairness where if

922
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,210
somebody goes out and creates value and

923
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,670
keeps that value secret and then

924
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,550
somebody sneak sneakily comes along and

925
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:19,520
sneaks it away in a sneaky manner we as

926
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:22,250
a society have decided that we have the

927
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,319
policy of saying you can't do that and

928
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,360
you shouldn't have done that you give it

929
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:31,490
back

930
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:33,320
now there are other policies involved

931
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:36,560
right the the fact that reverse

932
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,710
engineering something is legitimate is a

933
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,759
reflection of other voices coming in the

934
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:45,170
other direction that say well okay but

935
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,090
this guy didn't do that he'd wasn't

936
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,810
doing anything sneaky he wasn't being

937
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,200
Shady

938
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:53,750
so it's okay I don't know that there's

939
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,330
necessarily a loophole here to close I

940
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:59,420
see it as kind of a weakness that

941
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,130
results from these Conte's competing

942
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,100
policies and as long as their intention

943
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,890
you know in tension they're going to

944
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:13,700
there's going to be some some gray areas

945
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:18,500
there that people can work in I had a

946
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:21,140
quick question about when employers

947
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,690
employees and their children are

948
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,980
involved and what I'm wondering is

949
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:29,330
because anyway day to day you'll be

950
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,990
talking about something that's a secret

951
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:34,910
with somebody else and say they brought

952
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,160
a kid along with them to the meeting or

953
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,990
they're on the phone or whatever the

954
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,470
hell is going on but you're you're just

955
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:46,790
disclosing it to another employee of the

956
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:49,700
company they have a minor and this minor

957
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:53,210
can't be obligated to keep any more

958
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:57,290
secrets and so well that's the thing is

959
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,990
is who's liable if is is the company

960
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:02,779
failing to keep it a secret if one of

961
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,459
their employees yes so that year's a

962
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,980
phone call that comes down to the

963
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,100
question of whether they were taking

964
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,530
reasonable measures to preserve their

965
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,210
trade secrets and reasonable measures

966
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,370
like I said earlier you know depends a

967
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,830
lot on on the circumstances and the kind

968
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:21,549
of information involved but I believe

969
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:23,840
that a court you know would find that

970
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,820
letting kids in while you're discussing

971
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,490
your trade secrets is probably not a

972
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,620
reasonable security measure a lot of the

973
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,939
times these these well a lot of the

974
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,490
times the examples of reasonable

975
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,590
security measures come down to limiting

976
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,029
access to the information being very

977
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,360
careful about who knows it and who's

978
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,320
allowed

979
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,150
- no it the the instance the the

980
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,750
hypothetical scenario that I'm

981
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:50,360
envisioning is that you're having a

982
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,950
conference call with you know people in

983
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,790
other countries and so it's like the

984
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:55,520
middle of the night

985
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:58,580
so you have employees that are at home

986
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,960
and they're talking on a speakerphone so

987
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,270
should that business does not be

988
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,500
conducted that way because it seems like

989
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:06,680
that doesn't seem like a reasonable

990
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,170
expectation of a business to to do that

991
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,270
either so that was just what I was

992
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,480
wondering about no absolutely and it's a

993
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:16,040
great question the the part of what's

994
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,840
going to come out then when you when

995
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,550
that company is proving that they used

996
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,220
reasonable means is they're going to

997
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,410
show that they have a policy and that

998
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,140
perhaps the policy was not adhered to in

999
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:29,299
this case but that they have some track

1000
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,100
record of here's what you're supposed to

1001
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,590
do when you don't do it here's what

1002
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,500
happens to you we and so the company as

1003
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:38,960
a whole does take reasonable means you

1004
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,120
know we're you know reasonable efforts

1005
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,510
to maintain that secrecy

1006
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,609
it does raise the question of though

1007
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:50,500
where's the misappropriation right

1008
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:53,330
because if I'm you know if if would say

1009
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,600
we'd say good say I'm the employer the

1010
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:59,509
employee and it's my kid and I send my

1011
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,580
kid off to daycare and my kid starts

1012
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,160
talking about you know confidential

1013
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:07,250
client matters right and the daycare

1014
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,960
person hears that and it's like oh

1015
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:12,770
that's gold and they sell it to the

1016
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,150
National Enquirer has that day I don't

1017
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,800
think that daycare person has done

1018
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,080
anything wrong because the daycare

1019
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,770
person in particular didn't use any

1020
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:24,170
improper means themselves and had no

1021
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:27,200
reason to think that the child had used

1022
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:29,840
improper means so I think that

1023
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,419
ultimately that that although it raises

1024
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,820
good questions about the the reasonable

1025
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,530
efforts that the company is making the

1026
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:40,280
specifics of your hypothetical break

1027
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:44,450
down more in the improving that improper

1028
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:49,270
means were used so I am out of time and

1029
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,270
out of questions so thank you very much

1030
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,349
[Applause]
