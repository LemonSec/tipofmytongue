1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
all right so anyway thanks again for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,130
your patience with that so this is the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,349
the ask the FF panel and we're gonna go

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,509
and down the line here we'll talk about

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,089
some of the things that we've been

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,000
working on it at EF F and then we turn

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,689
it over to to you for your questions a

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,480
couple of reminders on the question one

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,240
of the things that a FF does we provide

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,890
legal advice to the people especially in

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,139
the security researcher community about

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,180
some of the challenges they may face in

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,579
doing the research and presenting about

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,519
the research this is not the time to ask

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,989
those questions though because what you

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,120
want to do is have a and turn a client

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,989
privilege conversation about them so

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,578
general questions are fine but this is

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,370
not the time to talk about your specific

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,739
situation

21
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,809
and so let me just introduce a couple of

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,489
things that we've been working on on the

23
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:02,370
legal side of e FF probably one of the

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,830
more important things that that we

25
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,479
worked on was a case called US v

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,920
carpenter it's a Supreme Court case that

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,820
just was decided this year and it is a

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,689
case about location tracking of phones

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:21,210
yep I filed an amicus brief the case

30
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,119
determined that the police needed a

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,809
warrant before they could track your

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:33,810
phone through the cell towers yeah it is

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:36,689
this is a very important case and the

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,470
way they did it was to decline to extend

35
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,389
the third party doctrine to location

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,460
information which is very interesting

37
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,740
the third party doctrine is the doctrine

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,350
that's been around since the the 70s and

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,640
the basic idea is if you hand over your

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,350
information to somebody else then you've

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,950
lost your privacy interest in it and no

42
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:03,320
warrant is required and originated in a

43
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,729
case that was dealing with dial digits

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,250
when pen register if you're familiar

45
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,038
with the term and they wanted to see if

46
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,120
this guy was making obscene phone calls

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,279
to the victim

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,620
check it out what what numbers he dialed

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,599
and those well you gave those numbers to

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,090
the phone company by dialing them so you

51
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,129
lost your privacy interest this has been

52
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,890
a cornerstone of all of the government's

53
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,179
attempts to increase the ability to get

54
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,970
things without going through a court

55
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,430
without going through a judicial process

56
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,650
and you know era where you put all of

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,470
your email on Gmail instead of in your

58
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,810
in your house you know will you use a

59
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,069
cloud storage you all these things the

60
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,769
government say well you've given to

61
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,569
somebody else and this should be a

62
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,680
universally applied doctrine every time

63
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,410
you give it to someone else so this is

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,390
important Ratchet back of this and while

65
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,890
the court said that decision was narrow

66
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,899
in the sense that it was only deciding

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,510
what was before it the logic of that is

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,760
going to be something very useful a

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:05,019
couple more things that we do on the

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,540
legal side recently we were able to get

71
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,819
an injunction lifted against publishing

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,290
the law this may seem the restraining

73
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,608
thing you're expected to know they're

74
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,010
all like you know most people know

75
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,980
ignorance of the laws no defense but as

76
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,560
it turns out in a lot of areas what

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,608
legislators will do for especially for

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,769
construction planning codes standards as

79
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,760
the law will be you have to follow the

80
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,459
standard published in this manual

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,010
standards book so on and those things

82
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,730
are copyrighted by a private company and

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,108
so basically you have to pay to find out

84
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,388
the law that you're required to follow

85
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,639
so we had a client who was putting some

86
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,109
of this stuff online claiming fair use

87
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,790
we think it was a good fair use case and

88
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:54,639
or that would be unconstitutional to

89
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,760
require someone to have to pay a fee to

90
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,579
see the law and so we just had the

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,620
injunction on that lifted and the case

92
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,030
will will continue but it was very

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,290
important victory for knowledge about

94
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,449
what the law one more thing to to

95
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,608
mention another case that we recently

96
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:14,079
filed

97
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:17,639
Fausta cesta FASTA was a bill that was

98
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,489
passed earlier this year that was

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,660
attempting or purporting at least to try

100
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:28,229
and restrict human trafficking online

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,720
but it had a lot of extreme consequences

102
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,710
for four websites as a lot of problems

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,390
with how the law has been drafted and

104
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,210
we're afraid it will be applied so we

105
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,610
filed a constitutional challenge to

106
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,770
cesta Fausto I'm looking forward to the

107
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,180
to the results there those are just a

108
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,500
couple of things but I want to take too

109
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,520
much time so we can get to your question

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,370
so I'll turn now to Vivian hi I'm Vivian

111
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,890
I'm a senior software engineer at iff

112
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm a member of EFS engineering and

113
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,240
design team so we're a team that

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,700
supports the rest of the organization by

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,700
building and maintaining websites we

116
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,979
work on AFF org and our donate page we

117
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,080
also build sites that support the

118
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,150
privacy tools that EF F builds for

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,750
example web interfaces and documentation

120
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,460
pages we maintain a platform for online

121
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,970
organizing called our Action Center

122
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,460
platform and finally we build a large

123
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,880
number of small sites to support

124
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,870
individual campaigns and projects um

125
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,840
something cool is I'm so I'm going to

126
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,000
talk about a few of the sites that I've

127
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,500
worked on in the past year they're all

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,980
open-source so if you're curious about

129
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,150
them you can check out our github

130
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,440
something else that kind of cuts across

131
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,719
all of our sites is that we work really

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,480
hard to support no script users who have

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,550
JavaScript disabled we do testing to

134
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,640
make sure our sites work on tor browser

135
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,350
and we also are increasingly trying to

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,729
focus on web accessibility to make sure

137
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,400
that they're accessible to all of our

138
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,900
users so the first site that I want to

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,630
talk about is our security education

140
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,159
companion and this was something that I

141
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,560
think really came out of some of the

142
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,930
energy after the election where people

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,690
were wanting to do more wanting to do

144
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,850
more security trainings and EF F was

145
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,430
really wanting to support some of the

146
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,830
grassroots work that was going on and so

147
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,390
this is a companion site to site that

148
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,550
some people might be familiar with which

149
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,860
is surveillance self-defense and that

150
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,850
site provides guides to individuals who

151
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,710
want to learn about their personal

152
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,410
security our security education

153
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,500
companion is a tool for people who want

154
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,539
to run trainings something that I really

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,580
like about that site is

156
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,739
it has really specific lesson plans that

157
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,789
you can take and go run a training it

158
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,589
also has a lot of really great

159
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,808
high-level resources for deciding

160
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:49,149
whether you're the right person to run a

161
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:52,209
training how to work with various groups

162
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:54,489
that you might be trying to help how to

163
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:57,219
give really great demos I think it's a

164
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:59,349
really well-thought-out site and then on

165
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,300
the more technical side it was a cool

166
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,849
project for my team because we have been

167
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,919
transitioning our sites that are sort of

168
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:10,149
static content and content management

169
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,008
from using Drupal to using rails with

170
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:13,419
some gems and plugins for content

171
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,969
management and that worked really well

172
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,409
so that's how we're doing a lot of our

173
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:21,248
web development for that type of project

174
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,839
going forward another project that I've

175
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,240
been involved in is called check your

176
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,369
reps and that has been part of our work

177
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,259
around a neutrality which obviously

178
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:33,189
we've been spending a lot of energy on

179
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,529
in the past year or so and that is a

180
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,479
project where individuals can see where

181
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,039
their reps stand on a certain issue in

182
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,808
this case net neutrality and then take

183
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,219
some action around that and our

184
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:44,769
intention is to use it for other issues

185
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:47,979
in the future but in this particular

186
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:50,829
case it's so people can ask their reps

187
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:53,979
to reinstate the open Internet order and

188
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,929
in fact people the Senate did pass

189
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:59,050
legislation to do this and now we're

190
00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:01,779
asking people to go to their reps in the

191
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,059
house and ask them to reinstate the open

192
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:06,039
Internet order and it's just a small

193
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,959
piece of our work round net neutrality

194
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,449
I'm sure other people will touch on it

195
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,490
but in addition to that for people who

196
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,469
want to go deeper on that issue we've

197
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,399
also released a net neutrality defense

198
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:21,069
guide where people who want to do more

199
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,499
can see how to contact their reps in

200
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,089
person or work with journalists to get a

201
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,929
great story about net neutrality in

202
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,819
their area and then the last project

203
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:33,519
that I'll touch on which Sydney I'm sure

204
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,560
will also talk a lot more about is start

205
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,149
TLS everywhere which is our project to

206
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,708
improve email security and privacy and

207
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,839
my involvement with that site has mostly

208
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,180
been from the web development angle so

209
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,670
I've been doing front-end and back-end

210
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,660
web dev to create a web interface where

211
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,079
people can

212
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,579
enter the domain of a web server they

213
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,290
run or a web server that they want to

214
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,180
know more about and get information

215
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,060
about things like whether it supports

216
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,160
start TLS whether it prevent presents a

217
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,800
valid certificate whether it's using a

218
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,779
secure TLS version so that's been a

219
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,240
really cool project to be involved in

220
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,870
and work really closely with the tech

221
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,939
projects team yeah so it's really varied

222
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,319
we've got a bunch of small sites and I'm

223
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:19,810
always excited to talk about how

224
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,300
nonprofits are doing web development and

225
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:28,839
how the individuals can support their

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:35,189
web needs so I'm Cooper I'm on our cyber

227
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:39,639
security team at EF F and we I study

228
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:43,509
targeted surveillance of law enforcement

229
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:46,870
targeted surveillance of activists and

230
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:50,740
vulnerable populations so I look at law

231
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,360
enforcement based spyware I locate other

232
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,670
law enforcement surveillance tools like

233
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:00,610
stingrays and emcee catchers and other

234
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,349
other forms of spying on people like

235
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,279
spouse wear and other stalker wear

236
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:09,850
things like that so a lot of my work

237
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,529
lately has been focused on spyware I

238
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,339
gave a talk yesterday about spyware

239
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:17,519
coming out of Lebanon that was spying on

240
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:21,970
civilians all around the world that we

241
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,889
took apart and looked into the command

242
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,699
and control servers and found a pretty

243
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,980
massive campaign being done we think on

244
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,139
behalf of the Lebanese government and on

245
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,240
behalf of many other governments by a

246
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:38,350
third party renting out tools and

247
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,870
services to these countries so that's

248
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,970
that's been a big report and there's a

249
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,410
big report online about it and I gave an

250
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,939
hour-long talk yesterday about it so I

251
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,959
don't want to try to compress that into

252
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:51,279
five minutes but I'm happy to talk about

253
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,050
it if people have questions

254
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,089
the other big thing i've been working on

255
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:59,680
lately is studying MC catchers so for

256
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,180
for those of you who don't know MC

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,089
catchers or I'll call them cell site

258
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,959
simulators that's my

259
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,970
for term are basically a fake cell tower

260
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,119
that's operated by law enforcement and

261
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,680
the idea is to trick your phone into

262
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,740
connecting to this cell tower of this

263
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,349
fake cell tower so that your location

264
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,170
can then be tracked and or perhaps your

265
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,240
calls or your text messages intercepted

266
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:27,589
a to record a tete cetera

267
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,300
so the old models of MC catchers were

268
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,009
often colloquially known as stingrays

269
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,248
which was one of the major brand names

270
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:38,120
and stingrays worked by downgrading

271
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:40,370
their phone to 2g GSM and which then

272
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,660
they were able to turn off the

273
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,999
encryption between your phone and the

274
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,610
cell tower and gather your location

275
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,129
gather your text messages etc it seems

276
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,930
like at least in with US law enforcement

277
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:52,279
stingrays have now fallen out of fashion

278
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,680
for the new model which is called

279
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:59,019
hailstorm and we're not sure how

280
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,128
hailstorm works yet but according to the

281
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,439
marketing documents for the hailstorm

282
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:06,050
it's able to attack users over 4G

283
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:07,309
without doing it downgrade so we're not

284
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,160
sure how that works

285
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:12,469
and I'm trying to research and find out

286
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,350
anything we can about how this works and

287
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,860
what we can do about it I'm also taking

288
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,040
some policy and legal approaches to this

289
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,079
I'm trying to work with the 5g Committee

290
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,779
to see what threats we might be facing

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,870
from if she captures and in the upcoming

292
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:36,230
5g standard and I'm trying to work with

293
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,670
phone companies and manufacturers Apple

294
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,249
and Google as well so try to figure out

295
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,729
ways that we can stop MC catchers from

296
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,050
working in the hardware itself and then

297
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,769
the final thing I'm doing there's been a

298
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,800
lot of talk in DC lately about the

299
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,329
threat of foreign spies using MC

300
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,628
catchers around the hill to spy on

301
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,819
senators so it's currently lawmakers up

302
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:02,120
on the hill have a bee in their bonnet

303
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:04,699
about this and I think that we can

304
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,529
convince them that you know if Russians

305
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:09,498
might spy on us we need to make this

306
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,120
technology stop working so that's a

307
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,740
that's another tactic we can take as

308
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,209
well and it's maybe a good thing for you

309
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,690
to call your representatives about and

310
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,609
say hey

311
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,660
this is I'm concerned that this

312
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,430
technology could fall into the wrong

313
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,490
hands and be used by criminals and and

314
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:26,930
spies and who knows what let's let's

315
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:28,700
maybe stop this from happening so those

316
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:34,790
are the things I'm working on but I'm

317
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:37,250
happy to talk about anything and thank

318
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,939
you very much my name is Bill Wellington

319
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:44,180
I am a senior staff technologist on the

320
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,310
tech projects team and I'll just go

321
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,810
through a few things that we on the tech

322
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,739
project team are working on in

323
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,910
particular and I'm working on as well

324
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,570
one of the kind of more interesting

325
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:58,040
things that I got to investigate was a

326
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,850
program that was being sold to law

327
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,380
enforcement across the country or sorry

328
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,870
to to individuals across the country

329
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,810
called computer cop and this was a piece

330
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:14,290
of software that is basically spyware

331
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:17,449
for parents to spy on their kids and

332
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,630
basically if you you know type in some

333
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,890
key terms that the parent identifies as

334
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,490
well as like that are built into the

335
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:29,030
program itself it'll send reports back

336
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,090
to a computer cop and you know let their

337
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:35,750
parents know about it and so we

338
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,660
investigated this program and found that

339
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,030
these terms themselves would be

340
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,600
triggered when only partial fret word

341
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:48,699
fragments were typed in they would you

342
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,760
know have you know send all the data

343
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:56,720
back to the computer Kalp servers

344
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,790
unencrypted a lots lots of shady

345
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,120
practices so it's very poorly written

346
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,730
software in general but also you know a

347
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,990
piece of spyware that was particularly

348
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,110
malicious that's kind of one of the

349
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,630
things that we try to look at is

350
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,810
something to use programs that that that

351
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:18,570
limit the freedoms of individuals in the

352
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,729
digital sphere make sure that we can

353
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,730
you know tackle some of those issues in

354
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,340
terms of reverse engineering in terms of

355
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,730
looking at how how these programs

356
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,940
actually work through forensics one of

357
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,480
the things that I recently looked at was

358
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,620
the kind of assumption that Facebook is

359
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,050
sending audio communications or

360
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:48,000
microphone signals back to Facebook

361
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:51,329
servers and so you know we analyzed that

362
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,770
and found that you know audio signals

363
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,930
from being a sent but there's a lot of

364
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,730
other beacons that they're sending all

365
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,219
the time even applications that are open

366
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,470
source like there was one application

367
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,970
that's a Oakland source street maps

368
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:12,210
called Maps IME and it was sending you

369
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,180
know beacons back to Facebook and we do

370
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,710
that through you know basically

371
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,079
installing their root certificate into

372
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,630
Android phones and analyzing the traffic

373
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,010
that way so that's one of the kind of

374
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,810
really interesting investigative work

375
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,080
that we've been doing on the tech

376
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:31,260
projects team I'm the lead developer of

377
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,720
HTTPS Everywhere you might have heard

378
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:42,689
each EBS everywhere the history of it

379
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:45,360
comes from in 2009 in 2009 there was an

380
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,290
extension that you might have heard of

381
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,270
called Firesheep and Firesheep basically

382
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:57,540
performs real time out in the middle on

383
00:16:53,270 --> 00:17:01,650
on traffic that is on a open Wi-Fi

384
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:05,369
network it basically grabs session

385
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,990
cookies and basically inserts them into

386
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,540
an active browser session that you have

387
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,970
running locally based on who you're

388
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,149
looking at across you know in the in the

389
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,480
coffee shop for instance and so what

390
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,949
Firesheep did was it logged you without

391
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,079
actually stealing any credentials it

392
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:25,949
logs you into an active session of

393
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,280
another user and what we knew from how

394
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,210
HTTP works is that if Facebook for

395
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,440
instance

396
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:37,409
had a GPS on their websites they this

397
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,450
attack would be infeasible because HTTP

398
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:41,010
provides certain guarantees a provides

399
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,600
confidentiality integrity and

400
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:49,830
authenticity and so having a GPS on more

401
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,029
websites is as a desirable effect and it

402
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,029
would make this kind of point and click

403
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:59,668
attack much less feasible so we started

404
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:04,309
developing HTTPS Everywhere intercepts

405
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:07,200
response to fire cheap to enforce HTTPS

406
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:10,168
where it is made available on websites

407
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,510
but not enforced some people might think

408
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:16,919
now well you know Facebook for instance

409
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,399
enforces HTTPS what's the point of

410
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,440
having a GPS everywhere but we've seen

411
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,809
from a piece of software that Moxie

412
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,230
Marlinspike developed called SSL strip

413
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:31,289
that if you type in a website you mostly

414
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,320
type it in example calm and that by

415
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,480
default goes to the HTTP page first so

416
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,200
YT QBs everywhere does is it enforces

417
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,880
that first connection being going to the

418
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,679
HTTP version of that site so so that's

419
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,679
one of the things that that I've been

420
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:54,020
working on in the past year HTTPS

421
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:58,049
Everywhere has moved to web extensions

422
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,908
Firefox used to have extensions that

423
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,950
were so that the technological

424
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,960
infrastructure of which was so small

425
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:09,470
that all the global variables were

426
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:12,539
prefixed by an S which is Netscape so

427
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,659
they've really updated their extension

428
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:19,020
infrastructure to be in line with

429
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:21,090
Chrome's for instance and so we worked

430
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,240
on converting that to a common code base

431
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,549
so now HTTPS Everywhere is common among

432
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,000
a common code base among Firefox and

433
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:34,350
Chrome we also added cryptographically

434
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,380
signed update channels so between every

435
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,600
extension release you'll basically get

436
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,690
an update of the rule sets themselves

437
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,840
those reg X's that

438
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:47,780
let you know when to upgrade websites

439
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,480
and you'll get a bundle you verify that

440
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,420
using the web crypto API which is newly

441
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:58,430
available even in tor browser which uses

442
00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:02,210
an ESR pinned older more stable release

443
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:05,780
of firefox so so we have these web

444
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,270
extension update channels and it could

445
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,850
for instance be used not just for the

446
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,530
rule sets that we maintain but also for

447
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,439
the Tor project if they want to make

448
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:19,670
their new next-generation hidden

449
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,250
services those 48 character URLs dot

450
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:26,120
onion more readable than you can for

451
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:29,540
instance go to secure job dot the the

452
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,659
intercept dot-com onion and it'll

453
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:36,350
automatically kind of you know forward

454
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,940
you to the proper onion URL so that's

455
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,149
one possibility of the future using

456
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,140
these signed update channels I was going

457
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,190
to mention a few other things but I

458
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:49,040
think we're running short on time so

459
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:52,940
I'll pass it along related to our

460
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,830
efforts to push HTTPS Everywhere I work

461
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,670
part time on cert bot which is the

462
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:07,010
client the FX client for let's encrypt

463
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:08,600
let's encrypt is free and automated and

464
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,580
we've had a lot of success in the past

465
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:16,010
like just two years I think there is a

466
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:19,659
statistic eighty percent of page loads

467
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:24,410
in the u.s. on Firefox were over HTTPS

468
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:27,260
so yeah that's really cool and the other

469
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,910
project that I work on as if you

470
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,760
mentioned is start TLS everywhere which

471
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,660
is an initiative to try to port some of

472
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,379
the success we've had in web to email

473
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:42,070
like similar to these lists or like

474
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,830
policy lists that bill mentioned that

475
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:50,030
HTTPS Everywhere pushes updates to start

476
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:54,860
TLS Everywhere is a similar sort of list

477
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:58,310
for email servers so that intermediates

478
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:02,389
it cannot strip the TLS between two

479
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:04,550
MTA's or to email servers yeah if you've

480
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:08,000
had the immense pleasure of running your

481
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:12,350
own mail server yeah you may have heard

482
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,900
or you may know that TLS for email is

483
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,040
opportunistically upgraded and this

484
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,100
makes it really easy for a

485
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,129
man-in-the-middle to basically just

486
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,760
downgrade any TLS connection between two

487
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,500
ml servers in the absence of other

488
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,840
initiatives like DNS SEC or Dane if

489
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,780
you've heard of those

490
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:37,610
so start TLS Everywhere is an attempt to

491
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:41,060
kind of push a solution to that in the

492
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:44,330
meantime while we see maybe more DNS SEC

493
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,820
adoption in the wild this was motivated

494
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,740
by some research in 2014 where we found

495
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,050
that I think in Tunisia

496
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:55,910
for instance outgoing email was being

497
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,710
stripped like 94% of the time so we

498
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,240
decided at some point that we needed

499
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,000
secure email sooner rather than later

500
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,380
and that's that's the initiative I'm

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,360
working on if you're more interested

502
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,900
about this I'm giving a talk on it

503
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:13,959
tomorrow

504
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:13,960
I think it's Rubio all right well thanks

505
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,490
it's a great overview of the work that

506
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,860
we do where you know you or tech

507
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,200
projects trying to make the better or a

508
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,149
world a better place through software we

509
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,040
have going for some of the legal issues

510
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,960
where we're trying to create precedent

511
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,129
and we also do a lot of activism

512
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,830
campaigns like the some of the things

513
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:36,980
that Vivian has been working on but now

514
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,659
I like to start out with your questions

515
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,000
I can't tell if anybody's lined up there

516
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,180
it doesn't look like yet but there's a

517
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,870
microphone there in the center and if

518
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,250
you have some some questions for us just

519
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,219
line up before and we will do our best

520
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:56,890
to to feel the questions hi how are you

521
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:01,160
oh and well so there's a big push for

522
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:02,450
SSL decryption software to being pointed

523
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,909
at enterprises I can hear about maybe 10

524
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,950
minutes

525
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,419
we talked about this but are you dealing

526
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,019
with that at all in which you're working

527
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:12,899
on my understanding is the enterprise

528
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:16,940
that implements this SSL decryption in

529
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:19,619
order to do a deep packet inspection of

530
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,019
outgoing connections from their

531
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,720
employees or anywhere inside the company

532
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,659
it gets decrypted at the border of the

533
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,619
enterprise and then and then I guess re

534
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:34,799
encrypted and I guess there's settings

535
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:37,228
that the enterprise can on their own

536
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,549
decide you know what is appropriate to

537
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:41,849
inspect what is not appropriate to

538
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:43,440
expect for example they can shut off the

539
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,210
inspection for you know if it's going to

540
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,609
a banking website or like a personal

541
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,759
website but I guess it's completely at

542
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:52,439
the whim of the enterprise IT department

543
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,720
whether to do that or not and and for

544
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:00,989
what or not are you dealing with is the

545
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:02,909
FF dealing with that at all um so I'll

546
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:06,029
go at least a little bit of a legal

547
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:10,399
legal perspective on that is that on the

548
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:12,809
whole a private employer can can do that

549
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,469
it would be you know potentially subject

550
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,149
to there was like a union there could be

551
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,769
negotiated rules with the worker there

552
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:23,820
might be you know exceptions to that on

553
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:25,529
the whole though without a employee

554
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,470
handbook that says they can't do that or

555
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:31,499
move and they can do that kind of

556
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,590
inspection and enforce things like don't

557
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:38,789
you know use your corporate resources

558
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:41,340
for private activities there if they

559
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:45,749
were a public employer then the

560
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,279
Constitution comes into play the there

561
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:50,309
are some limitations on what they could

562
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,279
do much as there might be in in in other

563
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:54,720
governmental contexts and there are some

564
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,070
things that you couldn't use it for so

565
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,299
you you know company couldn't use that

566
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,379
to stop all communications related to

567
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,690
organizing for example if someone wanted

568
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:05,428
to organize a labor union they couldn't

569
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,979
use this it would be illegal at least

570
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:11,249
for them to use it to suppress those

571
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:13,289
those communications well the press but

572
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:14,999
what about you know just inspecting it I

573
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,220
mean right I mean so we've got an

574
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:21,320
internal

575
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:25,730
union organizer person using ssl to

576
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,428
communicate with whomever and the in

577
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,620
their settings just haven't been set to

578
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:33,940
stop inspecting that so they're actually

579
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:36,799
able to view the the communications and

580
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,720
gain an unfair advantage right over

581
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,740
there so what what they're actually our

582
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,899
laws that is is that is that legally so

583
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,990
that there for them to be indeed there

584
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:52,279
are laws about protecting the ability of

585
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:55,159
organizers to to organize the the

586
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,750
resource that we have that that touches

587
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,580
upon this we have them called the legal

588
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,340
guide for bloggers and there's a section

589
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,899
concerning employment related issues

590
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,158
there and that's hitting a like a

591
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:07,189
slightly different issue like if you

592
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,110
want to work on your on your blog that

593
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,539
was a organizing thing but at least

594
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:16,240
provides an overview of the legal issues

595
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:16,240
there okay thank you yeah

596
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,870
I'll just add that if you don't like

597
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,519
what your workplace is doing you can

598
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,649
always unionize and it's probably best

599
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:28,039
to do that not on devices that are owned

600
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:29,840
by your office and the National Labor

601
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,610
Relations Act is I think the relevant

602
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,178
piece of legislation for union

603
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:39,469
organizing in the US just on the

604
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:41,289
technical side I think that TLS 1.3 only

605
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:47,059
provides authenticated encryption

606
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:50,450
algorithms and previous versions of TLS

607
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:53,029
offer some authenticated encryption

608
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:55,750
algorithms and some don't but without

609
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:59,090
actually installing our root certificate

610
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:03,889
in you know for instance the computer

611
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:05,629
your workplace then your workplace

612
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:09,678
wouldn't have the ability to introspect

613
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:10,899
traffic to you and ask the cell site all

614
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,029
right next question please

615
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:16,158
hi good morning Kurt this is tio Chino

616
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:18,440
i'm one of the co-founder of the new

617
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,080
york privacy board advocate and many of

618
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,419
the other co-founder in this room my

619
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,689
question to you see you they go ahead

620
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,529
good to see you again likewise and

621
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,940
congratulations on a great work you

622
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:33,360
doing but as you know new you

623
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,700
city is ground zero for where all the

624
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,649
surveillance tool come from

625
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,200
like for example Cyrus Vance Jr open

626
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:46,289
cyber crime lab in New York City with

627
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,200
the FBI and the CIA and name them all

628
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:50,970
he's sitting on 909 hundred million

629
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,129
dollar that he got from the banks and

630
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,879
what he's doing is pushing all these

631
00:28:53,129 --> 00:29:00,029
invest invasive technology this morning

632
00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:02,219
the New York Post posted that Governor

633
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,289
Cuomo is now going to put facial

634
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,200
recognition on all the picture that

635
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:10,320
going to get gathered from people

636
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,419
passing the tools my question to you is

637
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,658
still the same when are you going to

638
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:18,659
open a New York City branch of EFS

639
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,970
protect us here and so you can learn

640
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,190
about Alden all this technology that is

641
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,230
being used that is being developed on

642
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,570
the west coast and used on the East

643
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,309
Coast so we need you here when are you

644
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,149
going to open that thing alright thank

645
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:35,370
you for that for that question

646
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:38,189
so FF we are we are based in in San

647
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,570
Francisco most of our employees are in

648
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,019
interment school we have a couple who

649
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:46,799
are or not but we also we work a lot

650
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:49,230
with various organizations around the US

651
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,658
and around the world actually often

652
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,759
often working with local partners one of

653
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,549
our programs is the Electronic Frontier

654
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:01,139
Alliance which is a network of I believe

655
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:05,149
around 75 organizations throughout the

656
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:07,678
US including some here in New York that

657
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:11,100
we're trying to help give them the tools

658
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,529
in order to be good advocates on the

659
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,439
local local issues and so absolutely

660
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:19,230
there there are important fights to be

661
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,659
had in in all sorts of jurisdictions in

662
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,659
New York is certainly among them so our

663
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,279
current strategy is to to work with

664
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:28,080
local organizations and we have no

665
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:34,590
current plans to make an office in New

666
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,870
York I'll I'll just add that we need to

667
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,209
fight these sort of surveillance talking

668
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,758
our technology is at every level we

669
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,740
don't need one organization like AFF

670
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,480
fighting all of you need to be fighting

671
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,520
these surveillance technologies through

672
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,530
every means you can through

673
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,350
technological innovation through calling

674
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,420
your people to through calling your

675
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,850
representatives through putting pressure

676
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,070
on companies to stop doing this through

677
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,480
boycotts through direct action we need

678
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,960
to fight this every way we can because

679
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,120
this is how we slip down to dystopia

680
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,090
this is this sort of surveillance comes

681
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,500
along slowly but then we realize we're a

682
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,570
frog that's in a pot and the pot is

683
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,730
boiling already and we have no idea what

684
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,470
to do so fight it on every level fight

685
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,540
it now fight it in your jurisdiction and

686
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,230
everywhere Kurt I just wanted to add

687
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:25,290
something us sorry it's not the same

688
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,950
thing yes EFA we are part of the AFA and

689
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:31,290
there are a little group but for example

690
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,390
on next Friday we are going to meet the

691
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,580
first chief privacy officer of the city

692
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,020
of New York something we lobby for to

693
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,350
year to be put in the charter of New

694
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:44,820
York however we need your experience on

695
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,790
that meeting when we go in I spend three

696
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,860
hours dealing with her trying to she try

697
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,240
to push me off and she's in charge of

698
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:57,270
police privacy link NYC all those tool

699
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,059
so we need an office for e FF for e FF

700
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,129
to help us lobby those people who are

701
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,590
pushing those policy out they're not the

702
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,900
same thing UFA and the FF two different

703
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,629
things that is correct EF a and e FF are

704
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,640
deed two different things the Electronic

705
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,530
Frontier Alliance is a lot of really

706
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,450
great organizations who are making a

707
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,090
difference in their in their home

708
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,830
regions and we try and provide support

709
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,550
for that but it is not the same thing

710
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,350
also I'll just add where I mean a lot of

711
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,889
yeah peppers are native New Yorkers I'm

712

a native New Yorker and we have someone

713
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:34,020
at the booth you can talk to you about

714
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,350
New York's specific situation is Nash my

719
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,909

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,220
I'll sorry real quick want a shout-out

here that's doing a lot of work

723
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,059
organizing against link NYC if

724
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,928

with them like please check them out all

726
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:08,260
right next question please

727
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,360
hello I realize you may be reluctant to

728
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,110
comment on legislation that you are

729
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,899
currently litigating the

730
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:16,360
constitutionality of but you are willing

731
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:20,410
to say anything about it could you say

732
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:24,969
anything about the consequences of FASTA

733
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:31,240
and cesta for CDA 2:30 immunity for tor

734
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:34,090
exit operators offer for tor exam I'll

735
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,990
start out with just a Norview it's it's

736
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,428
cesta FASTA is for those who are not

737
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,850
familiar with there any who's making

738
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:45,700
some changes to to a couple of laws and

739
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,270
in this effort or they reported a for at

740
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,910
least to fight sex trafficking though it

741
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:55,299
is it reduce the applicability of

742
00:33:51,910 --> 00:34:00,299
section 230 which is a law that's been

743
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:03,010
on the books since 1996 that has been

744
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:06,340
extremely instrumental in protecting

745
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,900
websites for the liability of what their

746
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,909
users have done

747
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,010
I sort of like don't sue the soapbox for

748
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,879
what the speaker has said is the basic

749
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,320
gist of 2:30 and this has been ratcheted

750
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,379
back and this is cause number of

751
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,389
websites to shut down sections like

752
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:26,770
personal as in case somebody we're using

753
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:35,290
those personal ads to put in a sex work

754
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:37,239
advertisement on tor exit nodes yeah I

755
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,320
think most of the time when we when

756
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,979
we've deal with a situation where

757
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,679
there's a tor exit node that somebody is

758
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,659
looking into it's a conversation with

759
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,668
who are looking into it that there's

760
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,950
nothing there for you to find that the

761
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,690
tor exit node doesn't have the the data

762
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:55,299
that they're trying to do and they're

763
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,210
trying to you know pin it on the the

764
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,270
underlying person and in many cases just

765
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:04,690
explaining what a tor exit node is how

766
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,259
it works is is sort of enough to to

767
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:10,680
resolve the the circumstance

768
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:15,720
and I don't think that that should

769
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,270
change with cesta FASTA but if people do

770
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,399
start to say well no no because of cesta

771
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,410
FASTA I'm gonna hold the exit node

772
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,260
operator liable we would certainly be

773
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:28,109
very interested in that in that case one

774
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,240
of the pieces of software that you can

775
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:34,078
use I mean you know there's education

776
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,220
that tor people do and talking with law

777
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,829
enforcement is when there's a piece of

778
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,779
software called exonerate or so it

779
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:46,109
basically lets you know you type in an

780
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,170
IP type in a time and and and you know

781
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:51,720
when you saw suspicious activity and

782
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,359
it'll let you know port or exit node was

783
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:58,160
operating on that IP or not during that

784
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:04,680
time so that's one thing that you can

785
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:12,210
use to exonerate someone who is supposed

786
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:14,069
of suspicious activity thank you FF

787
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,050
taking a position on the Cavanaugh

788
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:19,259
nomination to the United States Supreme

789
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:23,069
Court and if he has confirmed how do you

790
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,329
see the future for our rights I'm so we

791
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:28,730
wouldn't we've been definitely looking

792
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:30,810
at the Kavanaugh history trying to find

793
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,690
looking at basically the cases where he

794
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,359
has touched upon our issues and what we

795
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:42,329
found is not good

796
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:45,509
Cavanaugh looked at the NSA's call

797
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:53,700
detail records program and he found that

798
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:55,410
was totally okay and this was a in the

799
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,819
DC Circuit Court was not one of the

800
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,009
cases that we had worked on so it's not

801
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:01,890
a directly commenting in our case but

802
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:06,720
the the theory that he he wrote into

803
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:10,049
this opinion was that there were special

804
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,569
needs because terrorism and so they can

805
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,610
they could do this unconstitutional

806
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:17,250
program

807
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:20,550
you know we have pushed very hard for

808
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:23,550
net neutrality and he thought that the

809
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:27,810
FCC rules about net neutrality were

810
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:31,400
unconstitutional and so which is further

811
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:36,840
than than other courts had ever gone and

812
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:41,210
so on just a number of AFF related

813
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:44,580
issues judge Cavanaugh is going to be a

814
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:48,480
vote against there may be there may be

815
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:51,360
some where it could be okay I don't

816
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,060
actually know if he's had a lot of

817
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:59,130
strong opinions I'd like copyright and

818
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:02,940
fair use issues but as overall package

819
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:07,050
CC with search and seizure on search and

820
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:11,760
seizure I think it is probably going to

821
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:15,000
be more friendly to the government side

822
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,730
of kind of things there is there sort of

823
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,950
an interesting trend and how it works

824
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,270
that going to an originalist point of

825
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,540
view on things like search and seizure

826
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:30,600
where it's more focused on things like

827
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,730
trespass and you know sort of there was

828
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,130
a case a while back this was a Supreme

829
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,950
Court case not a Cavanaugh case but USB

830
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,740
Jones that was dealing with placing a

831
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:43,140
tracker on a car and you know ultimately

832
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,899
that that decision was that a warrant

833
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,210
was was required for that but there was

834
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,800
a school of thought where the reason why

835
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,540
a warrant was required as because you

836
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,720
are like physically going up to the car

837
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,630
in and tracking something and thus

838
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,310
getting into the into that space and I

839
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,010
would be concerned that he might go down

840
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,810
that that sort of direction which may

841
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,070
lead in some cases to a warrant being

842
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:09,029
required but is a more limited view of

843
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,700
the Fourth Amendment that we would like

844
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:14,220
thank you I think one of the things that

845
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,080
we need to be aware of is also that you

846
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,600
know legislation changes with people's

847
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,370
movements it changes when people create

848
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,860
enough pressure for politicians to

849
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,558
actually not make decisions and

850
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,930
to actually say hey

851
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,809
if I don't do this like the reason why

852
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,459
Nixon sign the second civil rights bill

853
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:33,859
is not because he wasn't a racist to

854
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:36,709
keep what he was the reason why I sign

855
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:38,598
is because of people's pressure people's

856
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:40,939
movements that actually force his hand

857
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,410
and that's the way that anything is

858
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:44,509
gonna change we actually need to build

859
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:53,629
up that movement in order to make it

860
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:56,359
change I'm wondering if you could talk

861
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,599
about your process for developing the

862
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:01,069
security education companion and

863
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,939
security the surveillance self defense

864
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:06,589
I'm passionate about security education

865
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:08,359
I'm curious about some of the like the

866
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:10,339
pitfalls and lessons learned that came

867
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:15,019
along with building this security

868
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:17,328
education curriculum I was definitely

869
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:19,368
more focused on the technical end of

870
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:21,859
things but I partnered really closely

871
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:22,939
with someone on our staff seraya who's

872
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,038
here at this conference you should

873
00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:27,859
definitely look for her if you want to

874
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,660
talk to her about it more and a really

875
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,578
big part of it was that we worked with

876
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,549
other groups who were already doing some

877
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:36,789
security training zff does some but I

878
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:39,380
think that we really see our role as

879
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:41,390
enabling other groups to do this work

880
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,789
because there's so much of it to be done

881
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:46,160
and I it's a really we think it's really

882
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:48,079
important for people to work with

883
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,699
communities that they are a part of and

884
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,319
of course we're not a part of all of the

885
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:53,539
communities across the United States and

886
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,759
across the world so that was really

887
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:58,579
great I really appreciated that aspect

888
00:40:55,759 --> 00:41:00,819
of it and we also did a lot of user

889
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:05,329
testing you know having people run

890
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:08,979
through these curriculum and curricula

891
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:14,839
and doing trainings and giving feedback

892
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:18,218
I think some of the things that we have

893
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:20,509
some specific guides about are

894
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:23,929
interacting with other people's devices

895
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:25,519
and you know how to do that well because

896
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,869
you know people people have really

897
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,868
personal relationships with their

898
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,479
devices and so when you're giving demos

899
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:34,009
or you're doing hands-on work it's

900
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:36,198
really important to bring sensitivity to

901
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:38,119
that we also talked a little bit about

902
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,309
what we call techie pow

903
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,470
which can be a good thing you know a lot

904
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:44,990
of us are subject matter experts but it

905
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,308
can also be something where you know you

906
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,288
don't want to come into a room and say

907
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:49,849
I'm the expert and you don't know

908
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:53,390
anything and I'm going to tell you what

909
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:54,829
to do you really want to help people

910
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,868
feel like they're empowered to

911
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:58,549
understand their own devices and so I

912
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:01,339
think there's a real balance to be

913
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:04,099
struck between helping people understand

914
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:05,089
what the threats are but also letting

915
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,549
them know that there are things that

916
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,288
they can do to combat those threats

917
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:11,420
rather than just being like it's a scary

918
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:14,569
world out there and you can never have

919
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,490
any sort of privacy and one way that we

920
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:18,410
sort of tackle that is through the idea

921
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,990
of threat modeling so helping people

922
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,848
think about what are the most important

923
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,669
threats to me as an individual and what

924
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:33,650
am I prepared to do to address my

925
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:35,480
particular situation hi are you able to

926
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,160
give an update on the section 1201

927
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,940
litigation or anything you've heard

928
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,558
about this year's DMCA exemptions so

929
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,710
I've not worked on that that issue

930
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:49,630
directly but just I give a brief summary

931
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:52,999
for the for the others here where

932
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,609
section 1201 is referencing to section

933
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:57,939
of the digital money and Copyright Act

934
00:42:54,609 --> 00:43:03,799
this is the anti-circumvention provision

935
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:06,799
so it is a law that was created in the

936
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:09,140
in the late 90s after the pretty much

937
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:12,499
the recording industry but also movies

938
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,470
were tired of trying to come up with DRM

939
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:17,359
to stop copying and then people would

940
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,649
figure out ways around it and they said

941
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,430
okay well what we'll do is we'll make it

942
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:25,970
illegal for someone to circumvent DRM

943
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,960
and then people said oh but there what

944
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,180
about this what about that there'll be

945
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,519
all these problems is it okay we'll have

946
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,879
every three years you can say where

947
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:38,049
there should be an exception to two 1201

948
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,819
and so every three years you would go to

949
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:43,220
push for those exceptions so that is

950
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:45,650
under way but I don't know what the the

951
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,569
current status is and then we also have

952
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,720
a lawsuit which is challenging the

953
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:53,558
constitutionality of 1201

954
00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:07,098
and that challenge is also ongoing

955
00:43:53,559 --> 00:44:10,420
Thanks I'm short sorry I wanted to thank

956
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:20,299
you for your efforts on the cesta FASTA

957
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:22,940
suit I yeah thank you thank you I am an

958
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:25,190
advocate and activist in the alternative

959
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,720
sexuality and sex worker community and

960
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,079
in addition to all of the implications

961
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,839
of cesta FASTA for technology and

962
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,809
privacy and things of that nature there

963
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:39,730
are people who having lost their ability

964
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:43,369
to advertise whatever services they are

965
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,589
offering in a safe manner have killed

966
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:48,769
themselves because they don't want to go

967
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:51,490
back to a situation where they were well

968
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:54,169
essentially being trafficked by pimps

969
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:56,200
ironic that cesta and FASTA is doing the

970
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,930
exact opposite what they're trying to do

971
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:03,640
I wanted to know if the e FF was aware

972
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:05,839
and had any plans to look at the other

973
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,940
pieces of legislation that are

974
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,910
potentially coming down the pipeline the

975
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,220
stop banking for traffickers Act which

976
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:16,868
I'm not sure how far along that is and

977
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,859
also I wanted to know people who are not

978
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:23,329
coming at this from a technical

979
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:25,519
perspective how can we help you the very

980
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:27,200
good question so in the first instance

981
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:32,269
yeah absolutely

982
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:34,578
it is terrible that this law which again

983
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:36,979
the purport is trying to protect people

984
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:39,710
from sex trafficking is actually driving

985
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:43,130
people away from a relatively safer ways

986
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:45,230
of being able to advertise and get in

987
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,609
touch with customers to relatively

988
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,490
unsafe way so having sort of the

989
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:51,259
opposite effect of what it purported to

990
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,419
be and we tried to fight this law you

991
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:55,309
know before it passed and it seemed that

992
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,049
actually you know pointing that out to

993
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:58,609
the legislators that it was going to

994
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:59,750
have the opposite effect of what that

995
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,119
didn't really matter to them I don't

996
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,859
think

997
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,710
they were as sincere as you might like

998
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:09,769
in their efforts to stop trafficking and

999
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:11,599
I think they really just wanted to make

1000
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,519
life more difficult for sex workers and

1001
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,400
put something that they could tell their

1002
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,109
constituents here's here's what I've

1003
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,369
done on this on this problem even though

1004
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,848
it was completely ineffective

1005
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:26,210
so our legislative team as I was paying

1006
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:29,539
attention to new legislation and if we

1007
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,700
see more that comes down the pipe on

1008
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:34,039
that we will look for it though I mean

1009
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,999
we do focus mostly on digital issues so

1010
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,180
they're there it would have to be a

1011
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:40,220
nexus with our core strengths but when

1012
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,499
we can find a good opportunity to get

1013
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,788
involved where it does hit knowing our

1014
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,779
core strengths so we'll totally do that

1015
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:50,239
and then on the question of how you as a

1016
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:52,549
all of you could get involved yeah it

1017
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,019
takes it takes everybody to get involved

1018
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:57,349
with these things we have the Action

1019
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:59,629
Center action dff dot org where you can

1020
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:02,960
go there and see what current campaigns

1021
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:06,609
are and that might be calling your

1022
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,160
representative or signing a petition or

1023
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:12,558
you know tweeting at representatives can

1024
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,038
also be effective there's a lot of

1025
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,779
things that you can do the basic system

1026
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,309
is that the more effort you put into

1027
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:20,930
something the more effective it is that

1028
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:22,759
like an in-person meeting with your

1029
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:26,509
representatives is going to be much more

1030
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:28,190
effective than sending a letter a letter

1031
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:30,650
be more effective than sending an email

1032
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,329
a phone call would be yet more affect

1033
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,739
you know so it's it's basically

1034
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:35,509
correlated to how much effort you're

1035
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:37,579
willing to put in and for a lot of these

1036
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:39,109
issues we need we need a lot of people

1037
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:41,869
to put an effort so I encourage all of

1038
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:44,839
you to to stand up for your rights and

1039
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:46,609
get active good we've got time for one

1040
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:48,440
last question if you make it very quick

1041
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:51,859
questioner thirty seconds the question

1042
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,150
one minute for the answer please okay so

1043
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:55,190
there's some significant things

1044
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,700
happening here in New York in downtown

1045
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:00,529
New York specifically we are in the

1046
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,529
process the mayor is approving a tech

1047
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:05,660
hub and we are implementing something

1048
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:09,380
called Silicon Alley going down fourth

1049
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,328
Avenue which greatly impacts a low-rise

1050
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,030
neighborhood and is turned into

1051
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:17,630
something called Midtown south

1052
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:20,480
again the tech hub is again private

1053
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:22,910
entities that are getting involved and

1054
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,640
city lands are being used to develop and

1055
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:28,160
blah blah blah blah blah so again I hate

1056
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,828
what's hard on this the question is it's

1057
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,250
really important to have a presence like

1058
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:37,569
EF f a physical presence in something

1059
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:40,670
that's happening right like technology

1060
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:43,130
corporations taking over and and it's

1061
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,530
coming from one side only and activism

1062
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,930
part of it we are being slammed left and

1063
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,809
right like how can we garner more help

1064
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:54,200
from organizations that have such a

1065
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:56,270
prominent appearance like you all right

1066
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,069
thank you for that I'll just to a quick

1067
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,140
first of all we absolutely believe that

1068
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:03,230
New York is a very important area for

1069
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,759
for work to vienen and our current

1070
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,410
strategy is to work with local groups

1071
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,380
through the Electronic Frontier Alliance

1072
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,629
and get get active where we can we've

1073
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,869
looked at local issues also you know

1074
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:17,780
more directly and we will continue to to

1075
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,280
do so and then you know basically the

1076
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,430
thing is that we have only so many

1077
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,799
resources we are you know we've grown a

1078
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,118
lot over over the years and this has

1079
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,280
been great we've been able to do a lot

1080
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,309
more things but we cannot do can't do

1081
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,049
everything but thank you all for the

1082
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:35,630
