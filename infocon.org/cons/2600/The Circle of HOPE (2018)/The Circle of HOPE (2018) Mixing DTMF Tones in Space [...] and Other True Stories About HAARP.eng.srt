1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,690
so dr. Fallon is a real genuine rocket

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,519
scientist space physicists from the

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,280
University of Alaska and you'll hear all

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,279
about University of Alaska's facility

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,710
which sends electromagnetic radiation

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,590
into the sky you'll hear about what it

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,650
does what it doesn't do how and why cats

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,170
are sometimes involved and I have a roll

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,060
of tinfoil and we'll pass it around in

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,910
case you feel the need to protect

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,019
yourself from the emanations of dr. pal

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,300
and his talk and his aura so we're going

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,420
to hear all about DTMF tones and space

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,930
and very pleased to introduce to you

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,930
Chris Fallon

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,620
yeah thank you Greg

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,610
you're gonna need more than that nice

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,769
tinfoil hat to protect yourself from

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,100
this talk you'll probably need a tinfoil

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,470
suit in Alaska where it gets a little

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,759
bit cold we actually line our beanies

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,490
you know with foil

23
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:14,119
you know it's fashionable so I am the

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,399
new chief scientist at harpes the 3.6

25
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:20,040
mega watt radio transmitter in Alaska

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,740
that people tell a lot of stories about

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,750
that HAARP does a lot of interesting

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,839
things and this one is true mostly and

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,149
this story begins with a poorly doctored

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,679
internet fixed picks of a giant cat a

31
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:42,630
giant cat sitting on a giant ionosphere

32
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:46,050
heater this ionosphere heater beneath

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,300
the cat is known as HAARP and in full

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,729
disclosure there's a reasonable chance

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,700
that management made me the chief

36
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,590
scientist of HAARP recently in in part

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,130
to stop me from tweeting things like

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,960
this otherwise I'm free to talk about

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,079
just about anything I just can't tweet

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,820
stuff like this anymore and if you're a

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
relatively normal person and you hear

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,328
the word HAARP then it usually means one

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
of a few things

44
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:14,310
the HAARP with one a it could mean a

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,310
musical instruments

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,340
it could mean Irish beer or it could

47
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,820
mean subsidized home refinancing

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,280
programs and if you're over 50 and I

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,579
know there's a few people over 50 here

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,410
that then maybe you heard ARP AARP which

51
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:36,690
provides resources to cope with aging

52
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,720
but if you've heard of HAARP if you've

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,260
heard of HAARP the the kind of an H and

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,980
two A's and an RMP then it usually means

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,620
you're a fan in one form or another of

56
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,450
conspiracy theories HAARP is of course

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,609
the high frequency active auroral

58
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,130
research program the Giants three point

59
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,650
six megawatt or gigawatt depending on

60
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,409
how you

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,319
those watts radio transmitter with a

62
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:06,939
40-acre phased array antenna consisting

63
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,909
of 180 crossed dipole 180 cross dipole

64
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,189
antennas or 360 dipoles and every year

65
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,750
about next month we have people visit

66
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,030
the facility like you see on the screen

67
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,180
except for Eva

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,950
there she just walks around her home

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,269
like that on unusual she's a friend of

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,670
mine I don't quite know what's up with

71
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:30,040
that so a simple web search if you just

72
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,268
put this into Google or wherever and it

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,548
says that HAARP is a tool of the

74
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,010
Illuminati or the global military

75
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,280
industrial establishment for mass

76
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,349
mind-control triggering of precision

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,040
targeting targeted earthquakes

78
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:49,358
hurricanes and floods and a sprayer of

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,489
chemtrails whatever those are and oral

80
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,639
legend in Alaska this you know

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,950
traditional stuff even says HAARP can

82
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:02,579
make the local caribou walk backwards in

83
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:05,500
circles and Here I am about to reveal

84
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,349
how HAARP is simply used for humble

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,889
little science experiments esoteric

86
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:14,078
experiments and a little bit of fun but

87
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:17,289
mostly just science experiments and and

88
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,039
mostly boring ones or difficult to

89
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,360
explain and mostly both but to be honest

90
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,310
I never really know how to give talks

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,949
like this because there's so much

92
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,530
material to cover and my first

93
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,020
inclination is basically to go through

94
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,239
each and every one of Maxwell's

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,880
equations for electromagnetism all

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:43,030
seventeen of them in their original

97
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:45,130
formulation one by one and how those

98
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,349
effects apply to electromagnetic waves

99
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,180
and their effects on a weekly collision

100
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:51,490
dominated plasma and our upper

101
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,909
atmosphere it'll take all night

102
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,520
approximately at which point we will be

103
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,590
ready to begin discussing the plasma

104
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,539
physics that makes HAARP more

105
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,760
interesting than simply a giant radio

106
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,190
I've actually been discussing this

107
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,700
particular slide for about 10 years now

108
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:15,030
and happy to do so

109
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:19,340
day for another ten or I could start by

110
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:24,440
talking about the conspiracy theories

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,440
from the beginning from the beginning

112
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:35,650
so so if it all starts with Alaskan

113
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,720
doctor Nick Begich jr. who is among the

114
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,570
first to kick off the HAARP conspiracy

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,820
theories with the publish when you

116
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:47,590
publish the book angels don't play this

117
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:50,740
HAARP it's published in 1995 largely

118
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,270
predating the the modern popular web

119
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,490
right when I was graduating from high

120
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,580
school and if his name sounds a little

121
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,320
bit familiar it probably means you've

122
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,760
spent some time in Alaska if you haven't

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,729
heard of these conspiracy theories since

124
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,849
Nick Begich is the brother of former

125
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:10,150
Anchorage mayor and former Alaska US

126
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,560
senator and now current Alaska candidate

127
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:17,370
for Anchorage governor Mark Begich both

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,130
our sons of Nick Begich senior who was

129
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,930
elected to be the second ever Alaska US

130
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,120
House Representative and there is an

131
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,510
entire story for that that is

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,350
appropriate for another conspiracy based

133
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:35,560
talk that I I don't have time for HAARP

134
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,750
was constructed incremental II from 1993

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,900
through the collective work of the US

136
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,950
Air Force the Navy DARPA and the

137
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,289
University of Alaska Fairbanks two years

138
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,380
or so before the Angels birth book was

139
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,390
first published BAE as you know is the

140
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,719
prime contractor it completed the

141
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,690
construction in 2007 shortly before I

142
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,789
became involved with the project it was

143
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,610
completed by way of three main stages of

144
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,719
operation basically growing the antenna

145
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,490
array and the

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:13,390
a power generation facility in three

147
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,270
operational stages and you know in a

148
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:19,539
week or perhaps a poke to Nick Begich

149
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,390
the the 530 600 horsepower diesel

150
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,780
engines that supply the power to HAARP

151
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:29,110
12.5 megawatts or so of electrical power

152
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:33,340
those aren't actually named angel one

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:36,870
through five so angels do play this

154
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,369
particular harp as a matter of fact and

155
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,870
incidentally you know 12.5 megawatts

156
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,990
what does that mean I don't know it's it

157
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,570
but it's approximately enough to power

158
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,240
2500 typical American homes I mean and

159
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,240
and this picture is that you won't see

160
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,590
many places is one of the generators

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,580
arriving at the facility during

162
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:00,039
construction and anyways in 1990 for

163
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,770
about one year before publishing angels

164
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,860
don't play this harp Nick Begich earned

165
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,719
the title of doctor by the way of a PhD

166
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,160
and traditional medicine from the Open

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,720
International University for

168
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,960
complementary medicines in Sri Lanka

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,080
perhaps allegedly the largest degree

170
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,479
mill in the world and he continues to

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,940
make money and energize the conspiracy

172
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,210
theories through media appearances that

173
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,390
all lead back to his website here where

174
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,990
he sells books DVDs and dietary

175
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,990
supplements

176
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,269
and normally I would not take this stuff

177
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,610
too seriously I kind of a fun guy I

178
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,459
would actually be rather entertained by

179
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,009
this sort of self-promotion and nonsense

180
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,349
and and generally I am because free

181
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,730
speech really is a wonderful thing I

182
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,629
mean let's get down to a free speech is

183
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,970
a wonderful thing but also it's it's we

184
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:59,730
must be responsible about it and when

185
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,980
false speech in particular for selling

186
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,160
things like books and pills has

187
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,399
agitating effects on real people real

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,199
people with unfortunate and very real

189
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,209
mental illness in some cases in that

190
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,878
speech such as the things that Begich

191
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:18,059
says about her that publicly accused

192
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,929
groups of people like me and other very

193
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:24,389
very nice people of basically

194
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:28,049
practically destroying the planet with

195
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,839
absolutely zero evidence in favor and a

196
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:32,730
lot of evidence against I think that

197
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,399
speech needs to be really carefully

198
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,089
considered or reconsidered against the

199
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,999
negative ramifications of that speech on

200
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:45,329
innocent in innocent people and at the

201
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:47,279
university we actually keep a log of

202
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:48,988
calls about HAARP and and many of these

203
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,179
calls if you listen to them or just read

204
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:54,269
the log sir they are extremely

205
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,910
disturbing even threatening they claim

206
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:59,489
that HAARP is is torturing them to put

207
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,738
it mildly or causing various pains or

208
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:04,139
elm ailments or or things that we don't

209
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:07,230
necessarily understand and most of the

210
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,889
times HAARP is not operating at all just

211
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,059
not at all and and then there's this

212
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:15,720
which you may or may not have seen this

213
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:18,660
news from back in October 2016 two men

214
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,239
were arrested in Georgia with a carload

215
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,999
of guns and meth and their stated

216
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:26,600
intention for why they were doing this

217
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:30,179
operation was to blow up HAARP and

218
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,209
release the souls trapped inside or or

219
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:35,549
something and I jokingly said wow this

220
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,868
the the the souls are not stored at

221
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:40,379
HAARP we actually launched them into

222
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:43,129
space from poker flat and that also got

223
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,129
me into trouble

224
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:51,410
so my personal opinion not that of my

225
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,060
employer is that Nick Begich if you

226
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,680
really know if he really believes what

227
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,300
he tells people about HAARP and I have

228
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,890
reasons to believe that he doesn't to

229
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,490
tell me the frequency power and

230
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,410
modulation that we should use for the

231
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,140
mind-control effects or any of the

232
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,610
nefarious things that he accuses us of

233
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,780
doing and I'll find a way to run that

234
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,320
experiment let's see if it actually

235
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,770
works let's let's test this with science

236
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,650
in in in some way and you know I'll do

237
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,689
that and and if he's not willing or able

238
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,810
to do that then I think you should find

239
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:30,920
another way to sell his books and his

240
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:34,750
nutritional pills and that is in part

241
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,310
why I'm here giving talks like this

242
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,160
attempting to give to provide some

243
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,930
signal to the noise and obviously this

244
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,240
effort backfires on occasion such as

245
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,969
when I give an interview to the to the

246
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Russian media and and to be honest I

247
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,430
probably should have known better or

248
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,830
that there would be some sort of Russian

249
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,689
translation irregularities that

250
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,810
translated HAARP to some sort of

251
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,130
general-purpose climate weapon it's like

252
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,719
a Swiss Army knife of mass destruction

253
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,970
maybe you know they qualified it there

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,330
so that was kind of them and

255
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:20,150
unfortunately to a you know a recent

256
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:22,370
teleconference or a press conference in

257
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,579
Finland with the American president and

258
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,580
the Russian president I really don't

259
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,890
feel as bad about this as I used to yeah

260
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,930
it's I think I have to thank them for

261
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,260
that but you know anyways in all

262
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,989
seriousness as a scientist I cannot

263
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,720
disprove any of the conspiracy theories

264
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,230
I cannot prove what HAARP cannot do

265
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,580
that's just not possible however what is

266
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,170
scientifically possible were honest

267
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,800
intellectually honest about what science

268
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,010
can do

269
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:57,109
is that I can say what HAARP can do and

270
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:59,360
why we do it so first of all excluding

271
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,430
the co2 emissions emitted by the diesel

272
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,450
generators at harp harp only interacts

273
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,819
with the ionosphere way ahead way above

274
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,310
way above us the ionized portion of the

275
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,220
thermosphere above about a hundred

276
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,890
kilometers altitude which is illuminated

277
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,430
here by these TMA or tri methyl aluminum

278
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,589
chemical tracers launched out of rockets

279
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,630
from the UAF poker flat research range

280
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:27,050
and yes the University of Alaska

281
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:30,620
Fairbanks owns not only the HAARP

282
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,920
facility but also a rocket range that

283
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,510
launches rockets into space and yes I

284
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,949
think we're still accepting applications

285
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:42,439
for fall so there is an element there

286
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,480
are elements of truth to some of the

287
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,850
conspiracy theories and in this case in

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,430
that both HAARP and chemical releases

289
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,670
into space or use to study the upper

290
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,050
atmosphere in fact there are a few

291
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,029
scientists that use both techniques

292
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,160
radio modification of the ionosphere

293
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:02,689
with facilities such as HAARP and others

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,569
and those that blow stuff up in space

295
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:10,670
and watch what it does though almost

296
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:12,410
never at the same time and even though

297
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,729
most of us would love to do that I would

298
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,510
love to do that I only do the HAARP

299
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,060
stuff but rockets that blow stuff up in

300
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,829
space and HAARP that is awesome science

301
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,829
really sticking it to space

302
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,449
and by space I mean the upper atmosphere

303
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,339
even though there's virtually nothing

304
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:34,099
there this is actually why facilities

305
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,750
such as HAARP can do anything at all to

306
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,639
the atmosphere it's it's only in a very

307
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,630
limited region directly above the

308
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,839
facility far above and it barely exists

309
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,680
at all and this diagram our mad

310
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,790
scientist Google Image Search collage

311
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,349
illustrates the environment that we're

312
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:54,680
working with at the bottom of the image

313
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,319
we have the troposphere where most of

314
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,479
our real weather occurs and where we fly

315
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:01,939
and when we fly commercial were usually

316
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,370
at the top of the troposphere in the

317
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,310
stratosphere and that's where we have

318
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,680
our protective ozone layer and near the

319
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,649
top of the stratosphere is where Felix

320
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,888
Baumgartner made his famous stratosphere

321
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,050
jump on the 14th of October 2012 and

322
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:21,519
notice a few things about that picture

323
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,839
from that altitude the earth looks round

324
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,490
partially because the camera lens used

325
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,920
but also because at that altitude the

326
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,860
our earth really does have some

327
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,860
curvature and and looks around also the

328
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,470
sky looks black even though it's in the

329
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,149
middle of the daytime and if you watch

330
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,850
the video on YouTube there's plenty of

331
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,740
them listen to the audio there's ones

332
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,160
where he has a microphone in his helmet

333
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,589
and and listen to it and there is no

334
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,579
sound at least for a while until he's

335
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:54,259
fallen quite a distance the wind is

336
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,699
probably blowing about a hundred

337
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,089
kilometers an hour at that altitude

338
00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:01,250
about 50 miles an hour or so and it's

339
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,470
about 50 kilometers altitude and you

340
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,959
wouldn't even know it I mean the wind is

341
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,300
really blowing and and keep that in mind

342
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,369
next time not to ruin the Martian for

343
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,439
you yeah because that's the the

344
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,910
atmospheric density on the surface of

345
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,759
Mars it's not that different from the

346
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,120
top of the stratosphere and so wind

347
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,920
really doesn't do much at that density

348
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,300
except deorbit spacecraft relatively

349
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,360
quickly otherwise you would

350
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,359
and for all practical intents and

351
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,330
purposes at least from the point of view

352
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
of somebody without a spacesuit mr.

353
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,350
Baumgartner

354
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,899
is really in space and we have to more

355
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,670
than double that altitude before we get

356
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,160
to the scientists definition of space

357
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,620
about a hundred kilometers altitude near

358
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,140
the lower boundary of the aurora the

359
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,290
approximate lowest altitude where HAARP

360
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,760
can have it any effect at all and which

361
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,380
is that's kind of where we try to do our

362
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,790
vo left wave generation experiments and

363
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,939
we would have to double that altitude

364
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,760
again to two hundred kilometers to reach

365
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,360
the point where low Earth's orbit

366
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,730
satellites hang out for a while and

367
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,198
where most HAARP experiments take place

368
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:17,179
or at least where most of mine take

369
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,860
place in empty space or almost empty for

370
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:21,770
all of the three point six megawatts

371
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,869
I mean megawatts millions of watts of

372
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,689
net radiated power at ground level

373
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,479
focused into a beam that's about 5 to 20

374
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,559
degrees wide and that results in an

375
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,740
effective radiated power of hundreds to

376
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,139
hundreds of megawatts to a few gigawatts

377
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,790
the actual power density at the altitude

378
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,770
where HAARP is doing its thing to the

379
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:47,030
ionosphere is actually less than 25

380
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,780
milliwatts per square meter and often

381
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:53,059
less than 1 milliwatt per square meter

382
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,770
thanks to the bane of anybody who's who

383
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,428
needs to cover a large area with a

384
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,379
wireless network like what we have here

385
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,690
RF power discretes decreases with the

386
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,120
square of the distance from the

387
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,790
transmitter and that inverse square law

388
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,300
shows no mercy to HAARP it's also bound

389
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,129
by the laws of physics but what does

390
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,940
that mean in an absolute sense I mean

391
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,740
probably few of us know a few thousandth

392
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,440
of a watt per square meter is that

393
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,720
important well let's just say that the

394
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,070
smart phone in in all of our pockets

395
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,740
most of our pockets that this Canon emit

396
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,010
an entire watt per square meter a

397
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:36,690
thousand times more

398
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:40,230
per square meter when held at arm's

399
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,360
length about a metre away and so that

400
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,809
means the electromagnetic flux through

401
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,530
your brain is a nearly thousand times

402
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:51,570
stronger than where HAARP is messing

403
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,340
with the atmosphere and if you talk

404
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,600
about the harp waves that are bouncing

405
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,299
back to earth there are another billion

406
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,168
or ten times weaker than they reflect

407
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,150
back to the ground

408
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:06,809
you know where they supposedly mess with

409
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:10,770
minds and so that's the problem with the

410
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:13,500
inverse square law and it's why if I was

411
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,460
a mad scientist that wanted to build a

412
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,929
mind-control machine as Jesse Ventura

413
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,780
accused us of doing among others Nick

414
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:23,700
Begich also I would never build

415
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,649
something like HAARP no I mean that

416
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,690
would be the dumbest way to do it

417
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:32,630
instead I would build a large

418
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,630
distributed network of devices

419
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,470
I would build a large distributed

420
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,630
network of devices and somehow convince

421
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,550
everybody on the planet to carry one

422
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:53,000
maybe two everywhere they go including

423
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:56,720
to the toilet but fortunately I'm not a

424
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,120
mad scientist these days I'm mostly van

425
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,070
administrator

426
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,070
having now suggested that the only

427
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,379
reason we can modify this region of the

428
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,700
atmosphere the ionosphere at all is

429
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,580
because there's virtually nothing there

430
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,050
to modify to begin with

431
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,850
why do we want to study that region at

432
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,919
all I mean why is that important why do

433
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,260
we want to modify it because this is an

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,240
expensive operation well tell you why

435
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,240
it's it's basically because of this guy

436
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,020
Nikola Tesla yeah not just you know New

437
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,720
York City

438
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,490
mr. BIA you know that area but you know

439
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,810
New York City mostly but also Colorado

440
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,810
Springs near where I grew up

441
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:44,210
HAARP is after all Tesla technology

442
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,750
which you know is the same as what

443
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,300
Begich says and this time he's right

444
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,940
but trivially HAARP is just basically a

445
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,070
big radio and Tesla is arguably the

446
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,430
inventor in the inventor of radio more

447
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,800
or less and officially the inventor of

448
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,320
alternating current Marconi who gets the

449
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,480
credit was the first to send a wireless

450
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,510
message across the Atlantic Ocean and

451
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,640
the first to develop practical radio for

452
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,710
commercial applications and he so he

453
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,140
gets most of the credit and Tesla was

454
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,210
fine with that because he always said

455
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,470
that Marconi did it with Tesla patents

456
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:24,470
and incidentally Tesla also patented the

457
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,240
drone some of you know that and this one

458
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,970
is a submarine an invention that he did

459
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,400
pitch to the US Navy and war departments

460
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:37,010
as a device to end all wars they weren't

461
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,740
interested they saw no future in either

462
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:46,040
of those so why do we care about the

463
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,350
ionosphere it's it's a space plasma in

464
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
space plasmas affect radio waves that we

465
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,429
use for

466
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,460
in navigation and radar these days this

467
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:58,310
tenuous layer of the atmosphere is

468
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,560
weakly ionized that is it's a small

469
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,540
fraction of gas molecules or atoms that

470
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,270
have positive charge and equal numbers

471
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,250
of the with the free electrons and

472
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,670
that's why we call it a plasma or in

473
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:13,520
this case a space plasma and while the

474
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:16,100
gas is ionized it's still electrically

475
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,530
neutral and most important it affects

476
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,530
radio waves sometimes in a beneficial

477
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,899
way that allows us to communicate or

478
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,720
detect objects at large distances beyond

479
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,430
the horizon and sometimes in a

480
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,500
disruptive way that interferes with

481
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,320
communication and grade our navigation

482
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,150
and sometimes large electric currents in

483
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,210
the ionosphere driven by solar storms

484
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,100
can disrupt our electric grids and so

485
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,230
this is a picture taken from the

486
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,120
International Space Station and you can

487
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,830
see the Green Line emission from atomic

488
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,169
oxygen the brightest spot is about a

489
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,870
hundred kilometers altitude near the

490
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,790
lower boundary of the ionosphere it

491
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,060
reflects some frequencies of radio waves

492
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,250
which are useful it absorbs other

493
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,100
frequencies preventing communication and

494
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,810
detection and some some frequencies just

495
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,209
pass right on through to space which is

496
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,909
useful for other reasons and you can see

497
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,010
the space shuttle Atlantis re-entering

498
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,630
the Earth's atmosphere and it is

499
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,090
surrounded by a hot plasma that

500
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:17,210
essentially prevents all forms of radio

501
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,919
communication from and to the shuttle so

502
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,490
once again we care about the ionosphere

503
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,020
because it affects radio waves and a few

504
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,300
other things and it was in fact

505
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,760
discovered through the unexpected

506
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,460
success of Marconi's first transatlantic

507
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,230
radio communication a feat that the

508
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,360
experts the theorists and spare

509
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,850
mentalists and electromagnet magnetism

510
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,370
as well as the companies the owned that

511
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,709
owned the overseas cables across the

512
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,590
Atlantic that were charging Hughes huge

513
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,560
fees they said it was impossible and it

514
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:52,360
was impossible without an ionosphere or

515
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,429
layer that was reflective to radio waves

516
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,929
however in the 1930s we discovered

517
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,880
accidentally that not only can the

518
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,049
ionosphere affect radio waves but the

519
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
powerful radio waves can

520
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:06,480
also effect the ionosphere itself and

521
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,149
this slide is the first academic report

522
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,610
of the effect in the journal Nature and

523
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:14,008
just as an aside notice that the entire

524
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:18,719
article fits on a single PowerPoint

525
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:21,059
slide and now nature wants $35 a pop for

526
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,860
this thing but in my opinion if the

527
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,799
entire article fits on a PowerPoint

528
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,719
slide then sharing the entire article on

529
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:36,480
this slide falls under the domain of

530
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:39,840
free free use so you're welcome and

531
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,429
anyways in 1933 home radio audiences in

532
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,168
holland listening to a distant radio

533
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,259
station in switzerland by way of the

534
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:48,059
ionosphere reflection or refraction they

535
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,320
were really annoyed to hear the new and

536
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,879
improved more powerful radio Luxembourg

537
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,769
in between them that just came online

538
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:58,049
even though it was transmitting on an

539
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:59,940
entirely different frequency they were

540
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:02,070
hearing both sets of programming the one

541
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,499
on the channel that their radios were

542
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,779
tuned to and also programming on an

543
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:08,879
entirely different channel and this was

544
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,279
sort of a big deal at the time the radio

545
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:13,529
engineers at at Luxembourg they were

546
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,710
beleaguered with complaints they quickly

547
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:17,820
ruled out equipment malfunction

548
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,659
particularly since the effect was not

549
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,789
observed at all locations listeners near

550
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,470
Radio Luxembourg can only hear its own

551
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,869
programming when tuned to the proper

552
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,359
frequency but not at the frequency of

553
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,918
other weaker stations and in fact there

554
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,749
was somewhat of a geometric effect

555
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,450
observed where Radio Luxembourg could be

556
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:39,539
heard when radio waves from distant

557
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:41,609
stations passed over Luxembourg at the

558
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,460
midpoint before the receiving audience

559
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:45,889
and eventually the engineers concluded

560
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,940
that the signals from Radio Luxembourg

561
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:51,988
powerful Radio Luxembourg were being

562
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,700
mixed in space that is the signals were

563
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:56,369
mixed in the upper atmosphere in the

564
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,799
ionosphere a powerful radio wave with

565
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:02,039
amplitude modulation like AM radio that

566
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,809
a few of us to listen to will impart

567
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,200
some of that modulation on other

568
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:08,460
amplitude modulated waves traversing

569
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,859
through that same region in the

570
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,690
ionosphere and so this cross modulation

571
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,519
of

572
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,250
factor Luxembourg effect is the first

573
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,159
instance that humans actually modified

574
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,500
the the ionosphere or the upper

575
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,500
atmosphere albeit in a very small and

576
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,460
annoying way that somewhat interfered

577
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,440
with the enjoyment of radio commercials

578
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,019
the Platteville high high power facility

579
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,960
was built in the 70s the Department of

580
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,730
Commerce built it for modifying the

581
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,360
ionosphere is a scientific instrument

582
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,940
and it began operation in 1970 near

583
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,699
Platteville Colorado coincidentally near

584
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,830
where I originally grew up eventually

585
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,259
grew up it was a 2 mega watt transmitter

586
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,389
with a frequency range of about 2.7 to

587
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:57,320
10 megahertz essentially the same

588
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:59,508
frequency range as HAARP and with about

589
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,340
56% the net power although the

590
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:04,879
difference is is that HAARP can focus

591
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,459
that power into a much narrower being

592
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:08,750
with a higher power density and

593
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,970
Platteville was where the first

594
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,769
so-called artificial aurora was created

595
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,159
and measured though it first only in the

596
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,360
infrared and it performed another a

597
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,120
number of other experiments that we

598
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,129
continue to this day including the

599
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,129
creation of field aligned plasma

600
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:26,389
irregularities in the ionosphere and

601
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:28,340
these irregularities are actually

602
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,928
important for a number of reasons they

603
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,668
affect radio communication and

604
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:35,120
navigation and they also occur naturally

605
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:37,580
too especially at high latitudes and in

606
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,189
fact they're the main way that we can

607
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:43,580
allow us to use high frequency radars to

608
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,830
get a very large coverage of the

609
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,168
horizontal plasma winds in the

610
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,059
ionosphere through like the super darn

611
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,190
Network and they're basically space

612
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,620
plasma winds and they're important for

613
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,629
understanding geometric storms

614
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,250
geomagnetic storms some of the other so

615
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:03,678
some of some of the conspiracy theories

616
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,700
say now that there are harps all over

617
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,929
the world and that's also partially true

618
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,450
several facilities were built following

619
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,519
Platteville the question marks on the

620
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,500
slide indicate uncertainties have been

621
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,590
expressed in one form or another about

622
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,750
the future of the facility and annex

623
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,520
indicates that the physicists facility

624
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,340
has already been remediated

625
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,350
and these facilities include Arecibo

626
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,350
originally built as an ionosphere and

627
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,020
space radar also as a Space Telescope as

628
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,000
well and it had several heating

629
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,940
facilities or devices one of the first

630
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,790
was located near but not quite at

631
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,950
Arecibo and it was destroyed by

632
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,409
Hurricane Andrew after shortly after

633
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,410
construction so eventually a new heating

634
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:53,070
facility was constructed recently in the

635
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:55,740
dish itself sort of a reverse Cassegrain

636
00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:00,840
telescope in a way and that was shortly

637
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,790
before Hurricane Maria hit Arecibo and

638
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,490
Puerto Rico an event from which the

639
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:08,370
facility and and as you know the island

640
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,560
itself are still recovering the

641
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,389
incoherent scattering our facilities or

642
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,600
eiscat they have a large heating

643
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:20,550
facility at tromsø Norway and and and

644
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,560
they also have a smaller heating

645
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,230
facility called or had a smaller heating

646
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,409
facility called spear at the Svalbard

647
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,670
archipelago the Trump snow heater was

648
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,920
unique in that it used three different

649
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,720
antenna arrays but only one at a time

650
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,450
and they were for different frequency

651
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,840
ranges and one of those antennas was

652
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:42,450
destroyed by a storm in October 1985 and

653
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,120
and rebuilt several years later Speier

654
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:48,770
has recently spear as relatively low

655
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,989
power and has also since been remediated

656
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,580
the high power rural stimulation or High

657
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,700
Pass facility was built by the

658
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,370
University of California Los Angeles

659
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,080
near two rivers Alaska about 30 miles

660
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,110
east of the University of Alaska

661
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,139
Fairbanks and has also since been

662
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:09,479
remediated also an interesting story by

663
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,280
that but anyways when they disassembled

664
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,190
that the local junk scavengers had an

665
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,700
absolute field day when I high pass

666
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:20,460
equipment was sold to auction and and

667
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,990
those scavengers have been salivating

668
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,910
ever since at that thought that the same

669
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:29,280
fate may eventually befall HAARP finally

670
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,130
the surah ionosphere modification

671
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,899
facility was constructed in the former

672
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,340
Soviet Union now Russia and is located

673
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,640
about 600 kilometers

674
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:43,000
of Moscow it is still an operation and

675
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,299
as I repeatedly told the Russian media I

676
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,029
would love to visit their so-called

677
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:50,770
climate weapon facility someday those

678
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,690
want the youth words I use but I tried

679
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:56,889
to emphasize that they have one - they

680
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,080
shouldn't keep picking on HAARP so

681
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,330
finally that Bregan brings us to the

682
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,549
HAARP array that the most powerful and

683
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,129
exquisite radio modification facility in

684
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,490
the world we prefer the term observatory

685
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,279
because the actual effects of ionosphere

686
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,169
modification are basically imperceptible

687
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:17,529
without were very sensitive instruments

688
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:19,000
to detect them and near the center of

689
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:21,370
the image of course is the 40-acre

690
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,049
phased array antenna and off to the left

691
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:27,699
is the control and generator room a UHF

692
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,029
ionosphere radar similar to but much

693
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:33,279
smaller than the incoherent scatterradio

694
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:35,529
located at poker flat Alaska is near the

695
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,100
control room a little bit above and to

696
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:41,620
the right it can detect plasma waves and

697
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,260
the ionosphere stimulated by powerful HF

698
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,559
radio waves from HAARP and that was the

699
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,390
fancy slide I showed at the beginning

700
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,549
the other science pads contain a number

701
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,549
of instruments including telescopes and

702
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,309
I honest song sort of like a variable

703
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:59,649
frequency radar on the HF band design

704
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,110
for measuring the underside ionospheric

705
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,379
plasma density the left receivers

706
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:07,629
magnetometers rheometer x' and even

707
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,350
seismometers now the presence of

708
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:13,149
seismometers at the HAARP site does not

709
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,658
mean that HAARP is generating

710
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:19,449
earthquakes rather that Alaska is a

711
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:21,490
great place to study earthquakes because

712
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,169
we have them all the time literally we

713
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,610
have them all the time and the Hart

714
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:26,919
facility is a great place to put

715
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,709
scientific instruments because it has

716
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:34,029
space lots of space also has power

717
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:36,159
internet and technical support and so

718
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:38,350
this this diagram shows the relative

719
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,630
capabilities of each ionosphere heating

720
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,870
facility past and present as measured by

721
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,909
the effective radiated power which is

722
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,178
often misused in the conspiracy

723
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:50,190
literature and the ERP

724
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,929
is a measure of both the net power

725
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,559
that's actually generated by the

726
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:58,379
generators and output by the amplifiers

727
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,779
and the ability of the antenna to focus

728
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,689
that power and the physical dimensions

729
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:05,399
or the size of the antenna really

730
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,259
determines how well the antenna can

731
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,049
focus the radio waves at any given

732
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:12,480
frequency and since the net power from

733
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:15,539
the generators and amplifiers each

734
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,090
facility is usually constant the ERP

735
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:20,970
generate generally varies with frequency

736
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,490
in a way that depends on the antenna

737
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,980
dimensions at each facility but what

738
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:29,190
makes HAARP unique is not that it's just

739
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,840
the most powerful radio in the planet

740
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,570
practically for this type of purpose

741
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,269
it's that it's it's also the most

742
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,759
flexible I can for example be split into

743
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:40,409
two arrays of various shapes each

744
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,960
transmitting at different radio

745
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:46,049
frequencies the beam can steer in

746
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,740
various directions or Beach reshaped in

747
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:51,600
various ways each you know and it can be

748
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,749
changed about every five microseconds or

749
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,699
so so it can swing around really fast

750
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:59,240
the beam amplitude can be modulated with

751
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,950
a sample rate of 200 kilohertz and

752
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,799
frequency modulated within a similar

753
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:10,199
range and operated in a CW or on/off

754
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,089
fashion with pulses about as rapid so

755
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,520
these blurry photos for which I

756
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:16,319
apologize are the some of the actual

757
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,989
screens at the HAARP control system

758
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:24,359
which runs a standard version of redhack

759
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:27,598
at Red Hat Linux or Anu Linux the main

760
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,639
user interface is written in Java some

761
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,349
of the lower level functions for sending

762
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,960
commands so the signal generators and

763
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:37,470
transmitters are written in C and FB

764
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,418
FPGA stuff and whatnot and a HAARP

765
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,098
experiment campaign that's usually how

766
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,609
we run we don't run all the time very

767
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:47,940
rarely actually it consists of several

768
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:50,460
scientists all getting together mostly

769
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,790
at HAARP and and we provide English

770
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,500
descriptions to the HAARP operator who

771
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,170
then makes an experiment file for each

772
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,510
experiment and those files are arranged

773
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,850
in a

774
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,670
job queue and experiments in the queue

775
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:06,670
are then run one at a time and a harp is

776
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,190
also an electromechanical machine so

777
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:11,620
every transmitter all 360 of them for

778
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,680
the hundred and eighty antenna towers

779
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:17,529
consists of large variable capacitors

780
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,569
inductors and vacuum tubes that actually

781
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,030
have to physically move when tuned to

782
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:26,170
different frequencies more than about a

783
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:28,330
hundred kilohertz or if 100 or 200 or so

784
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,190
and this process takes about thirty

785
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,410
seconds so there's about a thirty second

786
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,870
gap of off time between experiments and

787
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,569
that's charged usually to the previous

788
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:39,670
experiment in the queue and incidentally

789
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,470
those vacuum tubes in all of those

790
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:45,190
little white trailers that you might see

791
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:47,439
at HAARP and those inductors are about

792
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:50,290
two feet tall I mean they're massive so

793
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,960
HAARP is really a serious distributed

794
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:56,970
tube amplifier so remember that when

795
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,830
you're you know have some music to play

796
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,419
so one of the displays the one of the

797
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,069
little green in the upper right shows

798
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,660
the current beam shape and the colors

799
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,490
represent two different types of wave

800
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,759
polarization or mode and X mode

801
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:11,649
basically right-hand or left-hand

802
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,150
polarized the beam can be steered

803
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,430
approximately thirty degrees off the

804
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,550
vertical without suffering severe

805
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,379
grating lobes and the two most common

806
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,480
directions that people use are usually

807
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,050
vertical just straight up or up the

808
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,300
geomagnetic field line or the magnetic

809
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,630
Zenith which is about 15 degrees off the

810
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,930
vertical at Gakona and about 16 degrees

811
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,570
off the geographic South and the other

812
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,279
screens sort of near the bottom there

813
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:43,210
show the status of the array with each

814
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,310
box representing one antenna one antenna

815
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,290
tower and they they frequently go

816
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,850
offline I mean it's a it's a large

817
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,110
machine with a lot of elements and

818
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:54,520
things do sometimes go wrong now one of

819
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,990
the many types of experiments often

820
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,970
performed a harp and other ionospheric

821
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,330
heating facilities are artificial air

822
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:04,299
glow or artificial Aurora experiments my

823
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,860
former PhD thesis advisor hates the term

824
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,630
artificial Aurora he hates it

825
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,160
and and that's because the the word

826
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,520
Aurora just sort of conjures the

827
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,520
thoughts of giant luminescent arcs or

828
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,009
curtains that fill the sky while the

829
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,000
artificial radio induced Aurora or air

830
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:25,370
glow is more of a spot or a blob perhaps

831
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,220
50 to 100 kilometers and in dimension

832
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:33,170
with an apparent size about that of your

833
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:36,230
thumbnail held at arm's length and also

834
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:39,200
the spot is extremely dim and usually is

835
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:43,340
only detectable by sensitive low-light

836
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,430
cameras or telescopes or timed exposures

837
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,920
to properly image and only in a very few

838
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,140
instances have the artificial Aurora

839
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,120
been bright enough to view with the

840
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,730
unaided eye and even in those cases it

841
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,130
was just barely at the visible threshold

842
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,770
were about as bright as the artificial

843
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,510
as the Andromeda galaxy and in often

844
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,340
times it was it occurred when it

845
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,040
temperatures are like 20 or 30 below

846
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,200
zero Fahrenheit so I personally believe

847
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,370
that people will see anything to get

848
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,500
back into the warmth my my geochronology

849
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,630
is colleague incidentally insists on

850
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,600
calling it not the artificial Aurora but

851
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:24,260
the fake Aurora but you know he dates

852
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:27,220
rocks for a living so there's that to

853
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,690
consider the

854
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,700
the artificial Aurora is in fact they're

855
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,460
like the natural roar in a few cases in

856
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,740
that every color emitted by the

857
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:40,070
artificial rora is also found in the

858
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,839
natural rora the Greenline are 50 577

859
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:46,190
angstrom wavelength or the red line 6300

860
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,770
emissions from atomic oxygen are the

861
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,660
most common in artificial Aurora and the

862
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:53,870
usually the natural rora and they're the

863
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:56,149
most intense the 50 577 green emission

864
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:59,000
is usually what you see in pictures of

865
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,180
the Aurora and this slide shows the 6300

866
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,210
red line emission on the left over HAARP

867
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,370
as viewed from poker flat Alaska about

868
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,220
four hundred kilometers away it's a side

869
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:12,650
view and on the right is the seventy

870
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,020
seven seventy four angstrom or infrared

871
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,420
emission from atomic oxygen ions and

872
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,310
videos of both of these really

873
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,770
magnificent artificial Aurora's are

874
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:25,190
available at the at the YouTube links

875
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:27,320
below but to create artificial roar is

876
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,080
actually really easy is if you have a

877
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,460
big enough radio transmitter you just

878
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,440
basically transmit a powerful enough

879
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,140
radio wave with the O mode polarization

880
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,710
at the right frequency and a small part

881
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,180
of this guy will light up you know or

882
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,830
you can complicate things a little bit

883
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,830
further and you can modulate the

884
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,330
amplitude of that radio wave to encode

885
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,819
digital information at the same time

886
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,640
similar to how a telephone modem or fax

887
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,590
machine encodes information and sound

888
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,850
and this shows the first simultaneous

889
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:00,290
slow scan television or SS TV images

890
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:02,839
transmitted from HAARP that

891
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:05,000
simultaneously created artificial aurora

892
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,560
the experiment was pre announced on

893
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,200
twitter and the web so people knew when

894
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,110
to listen and these images were received

895
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,930
decoded and posted to twitter by an

896
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:17,660
unsolicited volunteer in victoria

897
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,390
british columbia another set of images

898
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,950
were received and posted from pueblo

899
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,980
colorado but with a little bit more

900
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:26,299
degradation because of the distance and

901
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,090
now of course these were the images that

902
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:33,290
I showed triumphantly to management to

903
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,800
the ones filled with school spirit but I

904
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,250
also

905
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,820
sent this poorly doctored photo of my

906
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:44,700
giant cat next to the giant harp antenna

907
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,920
array which I believe is pretty sure

908
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:56,250
it's the first cat pic ever sent with

909
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:57,960
the giant ionosphere heater and it was a

910
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,160
first cat pic that generated an

911
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,140
artificial Aurora incidentally I also

912
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,180
sent a QR code for a private key to a

913
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,400
Bitcoin wallet containing a mil abit

914
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,450
coin or about enough for a cup of coffee

915
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,740
and a doughnut even still to this day or

916
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:17,759
and I'm not showing a picture of that

917
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,439
for obvious reasons because that that

918
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,260
cup of coffee and donut are still

919
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,720
sitting unclaimed in the Bitcoin wallet

920
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,880
and so at this point you might ask what

921
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,930
is the value of burning up 800 gallons

922
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,820
of diesel fuel per hour to make a small

923
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,089
part of the sky glow even very faintly

924
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,680
while sending cat pics wirelessly all

925
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,100
over the planet and that that's really a

926
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,100
fair question

927
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,650
it's a difficult question to answer in a

928
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,270
short amount of time I could do it

929
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,950
eventually give me it give me a moment

930
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,720
but the short answer is that we have an

931
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,960
incomplete understanding of both the

932
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,509
natural Aurora and the artificial Aurora

933
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,970
but they're clearly related and so

934
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,619
studying one helps us study the other

935
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,118
and and vice-versa

936
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,089
and there's also gaps in our

937
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:07,700
understanding of how of the physical

938
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:10,009
processes that confer electromagnetic

939
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:13,009
wave energy from HAARP waves with

940
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:15,289
wavelengths of 40 to a hundred meters to

941
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,150
optical energy emitted by atoms

942
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:19,760
molecules and I don't atoms with the

943
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,799
with a scale size of angstroms I mean

944
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,619
that's 12 orders of magnitude to cover

945
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:26,839
with physics and and that's very

946
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,119
difficult it's also difficult to

947
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,490
overestimate the importance to science

948
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,900
of creating phenomena like Aurora or

949
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,279
field aligned irregularities on demand

950
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,079
instead of waiting around for them to

951
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,960
occur naturally and when they do it

952
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,980
usually occurs during really stormy

953
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,690
conditions that create less than ideal

954
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,010
you know the the complication just

955
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,760
compounds that it makes it very

956
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:54,650
difficult to do good science the last

957
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,809
type of experiment I want to talk about

958
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,490
is cross modulation or the Luxemburg

959
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:01,099
effect that started this entire radio

960
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,720
modification to begin with and again

961
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:05,809
cross modulation is where a powerful

962
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,058
radio wave passing through a plasma

963
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:10,339
imparts its modulation on another radio

964
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,349
wave powerful or not passing through the

965
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:15,230
same plasma in other words if we have

966
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:17,359
two powerful radio stations transmitting

967
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,430
on different frequencies and those radio

968
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,549
waves pass through the same volume of

969
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:25,098
ionosphere plasma then the modulations

970
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:26,690
of those waves will mix together in the

971
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:29,390
plasma and the listener will hear both

972
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,890
stations on each frequency so if HAARP

973
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,520
is operated in a split array

974
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,078
configuration with half the array

975
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,190
transmitting a program at one radio

976
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,049
frequency and the other half

977
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,430
transmitting a different program on

978
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,680
another radio frequency than the

979
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,500
program's broadcast on those two

980
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,140
frequencies we will be mixed together in

981
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,080
space approximately relatively equally

982
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,420
on each channel and sometimes

983
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,650
and back in 2014 when we thought that

984
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,570
the Air Force was going to bulldoze

985
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,310
HAARP which is exactly what they said

986
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,310
they were going to do I had an

987
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,960
opportunity to be trained in operating

988
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,750
the transmitter itself and basically had

989
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,550
an entire day or two to do whatever I

990
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,040
wanted with the transmitter which is an

991
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:12,230
extraordinary and mysterious opportunity

992
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,590
when you think about it 600 to 800

993
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,760
gallons of diesel fuel per hour and I

994
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,250
thought wouldn't it be cool if we could

995
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,980
reproduce the Luxemburg effect similar

996
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:24,590
to how it occurred in the 1930s apparent

997
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,370
to anybody listening with a shortwave

998
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,870
radio

999
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,029
I mean scientists have been studying

1000
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:32,480
this stuff for years I've only done so

1001
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,800
in scientifically relevant ways that you

1002
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,920
know with sensitive instruments and

1003
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,810
whatnot and what if they're boring

1004
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,180
really but what if we could have a

1005
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,770
little bit of fun with it you know if

1006
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,839
you happen to have two giant radio

1007
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,460
transmitters of about 1.8 mega watts

1008
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,770
each

1009
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,390
what would you do and there's there's so

1010
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,180
few opportunities to bring ionosphere

1011
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:55,250
Radio modification heating experiments

1012
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,930
the public the public they haven't gone

1013
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,510
through twenty years of college

1014
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:01,910
however the artificial aurora is one

1015
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:05,180
opportunity and the Luxemburg effect is

1016
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:07,460
another and so I chose telephone

1017
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,279
touch-tone specifically DTMF tones which

1018
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,580
stands for dual-tone multi-frequency

1019
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,380
signaling

1020
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,569
I bet this audience more than most

1021
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,250
already knows that each touch-tone on a

1022
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:19,010
telephone as well as the dial tone busy

1023
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,800
tone etc are simply harmonic intervals

1024
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:24,050
basically to note chords where the pure

1025
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,180
tones are played simultaneously to

1026
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,730
result in the unique sound that we hear

1027
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,529
for each combination and of course as

1028
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,870
most of you know this is the very

1029
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:35,420
mechanism of controlling the old

1030
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:37,160
telephone company switching system with

1031
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,930
combinations of tones that led to the

1032
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,720
original freaking or hacking of the

1033
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:45,169
telephone network starting with a 2600

1034
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,910
Hertz whistle and of course one reason

1035
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,870
why I chose touch tones for the

1036
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,870
experiment is because they're familiar

1037
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:53,240
to most people at least for now and if

1038
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,040
the Luxenberg effect is present with one

1039
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,870
half of the array transmitting one tone

1040
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,900
a one radio frequency in the other half

1041
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:01,410
another

1042
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,820
at another radium frequency then it

1043
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,259
would be immediately apparent to the

1044
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,630
listener at either frequency that

1045
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,310
something unique was happening and the

1046
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,390
other reason why I chose touch-tones is

1047
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,790
because I had already written the code

1048
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,859
to generate WAV files as part of a

1049
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,150
demonstration for programming class as

1050
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,210
teaching for the College of Engineering

1051
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:21,780
at UAF and fortunately the amplitude

1052
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:24,060
modulation of HAARP can be defined by

1053
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,090
WAV files so it really literally is a

1054
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:32,400
big radio station that can transmit your

1055
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:35,040
playlist with gigawatts of ERP and so in

1056
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,830
April 2014 with a collaborator Simon a

1057
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,380
visiting fine arts and performance art

1058
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:42,690
student from Montreal after many

1059
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,220
attempts we finally successfully

1060
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,290
recorded a rival Eve maybe the first

1061
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,620
audio frequency reproduction of the

1062
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,910
Luxembourg defect since the 1930s and

1063
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,410
Simon was recording the audio with

1064
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,259
shortwave radios outside of Fairbanks

1065
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,649
and I was at HAARP and and this is the

1066
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,650
result

1067
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:06,800
that's the frequencies - - that's the

1068
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:08,940
Lux invert effect so this is

1069
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:19,409
sequentially

1070
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:19,409
[Music]

1071
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:30,019
[Applause]

1072
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,730
okay so the students really did so and I

1073
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,130
was collaborating with other arts

1074
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,660
students at the time and they did great

1075
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,910
and I thought well why don't we compose

1076
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:52,180
music to take advantage of this fact

1077
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,850
effect have two independent tracks they

1078
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,290
stood alone on their own you know it but

1079
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,850
if they're combined they would create

1080
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,890
something unique and so I asked the

1081
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,150
students to do this and they did great

1082
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,150
and they composed a very abstract

1083
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,860
difficult piece of modern jazz

1084
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,390
technically two pieces that we actually

1085
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,670
did transmit but good luck

1086
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:13,029
distinguishing any Luxemburg effect from

1087
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:18,280
that and after as interviewed by NPR's

1088
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,330
all things considered - you know I on a

1089
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,670
story they were doing about the HAARP

1090
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,350
remediation the impending remediation as

1091
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,730
quoted saying something while it's like

1092
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,299
in retrospect I wish I had done

1093
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:32,470
something like like row row row your

1094
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:36,690
boat so

1095
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,689
I did that

1096
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,590
so that's the tuned frequency there's a

1097
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:55,200
bucks

1098
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:58,200
[Music]

1099
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,200
-

1100
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:10,110
and so that was that was done by a

1101
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:13,440
collaborator of mine Calif Jeff dooms

1102
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:17,820
kale for IU and he composed those tracks

1103
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,040
and also played them and so he was so he

1104
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:22,110
had such fun with that that he also was

1105
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,620
able to do the first crowdsource

1106
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:27,600
experiment later the crowdsource funded

1107
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,700
experiment and he actually looked at a

1108
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,490
science aspect of the Luxemburg effect

1109
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,830
and so this is the first ever one that

1110
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:37,500
he did and he and and and it turned out

1111
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:39,150
that you know he did this scientific

1112
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,580
experiment close it out with a very

1113
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:45,270
rockin version of the star-spangled

1114
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,640
banner with his electric guitar and paid

1115
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:49,680
for the entire experiment with a credit

1116
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,670
card which is you know like a rockstar

1117
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,190
and we do accept all major credit cards

1118
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,320
for harp experiments so get involved

1119
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,180
especially if you know that an idea and

1120
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,410
some money to burn or if you just have

1121
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,210
money to burn bring it to us you we have

1122
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,720
two or three more experiment campaigns

1123
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:11,430
planned and you know after that who

1124
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,319
knows that's the the funding environment

1125
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,359
and if somebody knows I don't know they

1126
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,690
might be giants I bet they might have a

1127
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:21,240
few ideas and their songs are short so

1128
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:25,580
they probably won't cost very much so

1129
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,049
get involved tune in you know you

1130
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,819
through the Twitter's and things you'll

1131
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,950
know when HAARP is operating and if

1132
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,800
you're in the Alaska or Yukon Territory

1133
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:37,560
area you have opportunities to focus to

1134
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,140
photograph the artificial aurora but

1135
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,060
maybe not during this summer and if you

1136
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,420
have a shortwave radio such as the sea

1137
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,220
crane sky wave radio then you can tune

1138
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,490
in and listen and most the time it just

1139
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:53,430
sounds like a DJ forgot to put the next

1140
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,290
record on and it's silence but sometimes

1141
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,379
they do insert interesting modulations

1142
00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:00,600
that create interesting time scapes and

1143
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,870
if you don't hear anything I'm sorry but

1144
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,600
we just need more power

1145
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:08,120
you know in more money yeah you know how

1146
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,850
it goes and if you don't want to listen

1147
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,890
to harp say when we're transmitting at

1148
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:17,299
9,500 kilohertz and you want to listen

1149
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:19,220
to radio China true story or you don't

1150
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,770
expect HAARP artificial roar I'm messing

1151
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,870
up your view of the night sky from north

1152
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:27,230
of the Arctic Circle another true story

1153
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:30,259
you can see that they're just you know

1154
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:32,150
just remember that we don't do this sort

1155
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,010
of thing very often two or three times

1156
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:40,180
at most and when we do it's just for

1157
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:40,180
