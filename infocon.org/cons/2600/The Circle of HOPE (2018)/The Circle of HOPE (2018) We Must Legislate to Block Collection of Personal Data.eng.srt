1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,599
so first I have some conditions about

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,059
photographs and recordings please do not

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,420
put any photograph in which I appear

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,590
into Facebook Instagram or what's up

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,250
those are three tentacles of the same

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:29,189
surveillance monster Facebook does not

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:31,980
have users it has used Facebook knows

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,399
how to recognize people in photos from

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,620
their faces or the backs of their heads

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,629
so if you put a photo into Facebook in

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,899
which a person appears you are helping

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,780
the monster track that person it's a bad

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:55,620
way to treat your friends and please

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:58,609
don't do it to me second which means

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,468
turn that off in Android in the

16
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,840
parameters of the camera application you

17
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,650
can find a parameter to turn that off in

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:14,490
an eye monster I believe there's a

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:18,330
setting under privacy and in general get

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,220
100% ready to take the photo before you

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,479
approach me about taking the photo

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,630
please

23
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,229
make efficient use of my time because I

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,979
have a lot of work to do today

25
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:34,950
other than this talk and with regard to

26
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,408
recordings it's okay if you make an

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,750
audio or video recording but if you want

28
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,590
to distribute copies please do so only

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,159
in formats that work with free software

30
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,159
tests at first

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:53,030
then make sure the distribution site

32
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,570
works with free software so don't put it

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:59,570
in YouTube or Vimeo those sites require

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,479
people to run non-free software to see

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:05,178
anything if you visit a youtube page in

36
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,119
a browser and you don't run the non free

37
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:13,280
javascript code that it sends you will

38
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:17,420
see a blank window in Vimeo you'll see

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:22,489
everything except the video that's the

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:25,518
way YouTube was before so don't do that

41
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,760
don't distribute videos of my talks that

42
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,100
way distributed in sites distribute them

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,630
in sites that treat the users freedom

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:39,829
with respect and finally please put on

45
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,769
the recordings the Creative Commons no

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,260
derivatives license because this is not

47
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:51,320
a technically useful work this is a

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:54,709
presentation of a point of view so this

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,519
is not a talk about free software not in

50
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:01,280
general but I want to start with part of

51
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,590
a free software presentation to lead up

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,170
to the relevance of free software to

53
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,650
this issue because I came to the issue

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,410
of fighting surveillance out of my

55
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,950
campaign for software that respects our

56
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:19,910
freedom and indeed software that doesn't

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,060
respect our freedom is a one of them

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:26,299
primary means of surveilling people but

59
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,790
not the only one so first of all free

60
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,910
software is software that respects users

61
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,190
freedom and community we don't mean it's

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:40,130
gratis we're not talking about price at

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:42,260
all so it's Libre it's not gratis well

64
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,750
often it is often copies may be

65
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,149
available gratis and sometimes they're

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,810
not but that's a side issue it's a

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,579
little detail of practical detail which

68
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,220
is not what we're concerned with we're

69
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:58,340
only concerned with whether once you

70
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,109
have the program does it respect your

71
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,630
freedom

72
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,490
or does it crush your freedom does it

73
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,190
respect your community or does it

74
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,620
attempt to carve up and divide your

75
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,650
community these are important ethical

76
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,790
issues who pays who how much to whom is

77
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:22,240
not a major ethical issue as for things

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:27,099
that are not necessities of life so what

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:32,170
is a program and what is a computer well

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,720
a computer is a universal computing

81
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,660
engine but it only does a very simple

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,510
thing conceptually simple at least which

83
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,910
is get the next instruction and do what

84
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,680
that says and get the next instruction

85
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,990
and do what that says and the next one

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,940
and the next one millions of times a

87
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,850
second it will get an instruction and

88
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,910
carry out what that instruction says the

89
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,380
instructions come from a program

90
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,260
depending on what instructions that

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:02,080
program has it will make the computer

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,500
the same computer do this or that or the

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,979
other thing or anything anything at all

94
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,169
within the range of what computers can

95
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,169
do so there are things computers can't

96
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:17,590
do and no program can make the computer

97
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,560
do that but considering the things the

98
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,700
computer can do the right program will

99
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,280
make it do any of those things by based

100
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,620
on which instructions it gives to the

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,320
computer so the question is who gives

102
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,680
the instructions to your computer you

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,360
might think it's you when really it's

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:44,260
someone else you might think your

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,740
computer obeys you when really it's

106
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,669
always obeying its true master and its

107
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:55,060
true master decides when it's permitted

108
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,780
to carry out your requests and when it's

109
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,030
not with any program there are two

110
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,450
possibilities either the users control

111
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,330
the program or the program controls the

112
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:10,469
users it's always one or the other

113
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,700
because there's no other way it can be

114
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:16,740
when the users control

115
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:21,550
the program that's free software why so

116
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:24,850
well what is freedom freedom means

117
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,950
having control of your own life control

118
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,910
of the activities that you do in your

119
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:33,610
life well if you use a program to do the

120
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,670
activity control of the activity calls

121
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,080
for control of the program you're using

122
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:43,630
to do it so when the users control the

123
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,520
program that program respects the users

124
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:51,850
freedom and community so it's free

125
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,830
software in practical terms in order for

126
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,580
users to have control of the program

127
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,950
they need the four essential freedoms so

128
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,419
these four essential freedoms are the

129
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,789
practical criterion for a free program

130
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:12,270
freedom zero is the freedom to run the

131
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:16,210
program any way you wish for any purpose

132
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,400
freedom one is the freedom to study the

133
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,270
source code of the program and change it

134
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,419
so that it does your computing

135
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:28,450
activities the way you wish now why do

136
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,570
we insist on source code here you can

137
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,729
see some source code it's a mixture of

138
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,980
English and math if you've learned that

139
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,170
language you can read and understand the

140
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,960
source code and then change it so it

141
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:46,120
will do something different to run it we

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:52,270
typically turn it into an executable hmm

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,760
something's strangely oh well the

144
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,890
executable is a bunch of enigmatic ones

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,960
and zeros which if it's that short it's

146
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,020
not that hard to figure it out but when

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,750
it gets to be more of them figuring out

148
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,000
what they mean gets to be a big job and

149
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,540
for a real program which might have

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,670
millions of ones and zeros figuring out

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,070
what the executable means is a

152
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,600
tremendously hard job that people don't

153
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,930
even try except as a desperate last

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,930
recourse so

155
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,250
if all the users get is the executable

156
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:36,029
practically speaking they don't have the

157
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,849
option of changing it and therefore it's

158
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:43,318
not free software so these two freedoms

159
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:46,740
together give us separate control over

160
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:49,560
the program here we see four users each

161
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,350
one separately using this program but

162
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,989
one of them is exercising freedom one by

163
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,420
changing it separate control means I'm

164
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,759
free to change my copies and you're free

165
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,630
to change your copies and you're free to

166
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:07,259
change your copies but while that's

167
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,839
essential it's not enough because most

168
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,209
of the users are not programmers most

169
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,910
users don't know how to study and change

170
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,459
source code because that's not their

171
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,259
field that's not something they learned

172
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,989
it's not something you have a talent for

173
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:27,959
they do other things and it's fine that

174
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,180
people are not programmers there are

175
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,839
lots of other interesting or and useful

176
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,689
things to do in the in life but they do

177
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,510
have deserve they control of their own

178
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,660
computing how can people who aren't

179
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,600
programmers participate in control of

180
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,620
what the program's do through collective

181
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,560
control which means the freedom for

182
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,980
users to work together to exercise

183
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,959
control over what the program does at

184
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,600
the top we see a group of three users

185
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,268
that are working together to exercise

186
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,550
control over this program the two on the

187
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,069
right are changing the code they must be

188
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,680
programmers the one on the left is not

189
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:13,529
changing the code person may not know

190
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:18,899
how to program or maybe person does know

191
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:21,930
how but isn't doing so in this case but

192
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,279
this user does participate in control

193
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,560
over that program through the

194
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,759
discussions that the group has about

195
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,349
what changes to make the ones who

196
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,300
cooperate in this way or those who

197
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,399
choose to at the bottom there are two

198
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,410
more users who are not working with

199
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,790
those three why not

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,319
could be any reason

201
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,300
or maybe they don't know each other

202
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,020
maybe tomorrow they'll decide to work

203
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,120
together or maybe not because each one

204
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:55,319
of them is free to cooperate with others

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:59,010
or not collective control requires two

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:03,570
more essential freedoms freedom 2 is the

207
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:06,000
freedom to make exact copies and then

208
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:10,680
give or sell them to others when you

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,570
wish and freedom 3 is the freedom to

210
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,969
make copies of your modified versions

211
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,650
and give or sell them to others when you

212
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:23,670
wish with these two freedoms the group

213
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:26,520
can cooperate if some user in the group

214
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,130
makes a modified version version person

215
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,590
can use freedom 3 under freedom 3 make

216
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,770
copies of that version and distribute

217
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,960
them to others in the group then any of

218
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,150
them through freedom 2 can make more

219
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:44,490
copies and redistribute them to others

220
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:49,290
in the group but the group does not have

221
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:52,320
to have a formal existence or a list of

222
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,689
members and freedoms 2 & 3 are not

223
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,700
limited to members of any particular

224
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,600
group you could distribute copies to

225
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,850
anyone you can even offer copies to the

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,020
general public which means publishing

227
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,500
that version this is legitimate it's

228
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:13,380
part of the freedom you've got to have

229
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,500
so when the program carries these 4

230
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,960
freedoms thoroughly and adequately then

231
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,680
it's free software because the users

232
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,730
control the program both singly and

233
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,680
collectively and therefore it respects

234
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,570
their freedom but if one of these

235
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,880
freedoms is missing or incomplete then

236
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,680
the users don't control the program

237
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,250
instead the program controls the users

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,810
and the program's owner or developer

239
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:51,130
controls the program so this program is

240
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:54,520
an instrument of unjust power 4 power

241
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,030
the developer or owner / the users of

242
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:02,260
the program this is why a non-free

243
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:05,380
program is inherently unjust it

244
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,750
shouldn't exist there shouldn't be non

245
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:14,380
free software because every non free

246
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:17,530
program subjugates its users so because

247
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,020
of this you shouldn't participate in

248
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,480
developing non-free programs that's

249
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,410
making the world a worse place it's

250
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,750
better to do nothing at all then develop

251
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,900
non-free software because if you develop

252
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,330
non-free software you're harming people

253
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,040
taking away their freedom if you do

254
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:43,150
nothing at least you're not doing any

255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:46,990
harm now one curious very common special

256
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:49,120
case that people sometimes gets wrong

257
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,850
about is what if you write a program

258
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,690
yourself and you use it yourself without

259
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:59,410
ever distributing a copy well in this

260
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:02,650
case there's only one user and all one

261
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:06,400
users have the four freedoms so it's

262
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:08,410
free software likewise if a company

263
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,400
develops some software and uses it

264
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:15,600
internally without ever releasing it

265
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:18,699
it's free software in this trivial way

266
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,030
non-free software begins when the

267
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,540
developer distributes a copy to some

268
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,910
other user but without the four freedoms

269
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,640
that puts the other user under the

270
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:40,650
developers power and this is the

271
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:43,270
injustice we're trying to stop now this

272
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:49,090
basic injustice that the developer has

273
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:52,030
power over the users corrupts the

274
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:56,470
developer power corrupts and this power

275
00:14:52,030 --> 00:15:01,360
is no different the developer generally

276
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:05,050
feels the temptation to try to make use

277
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,839
that power to gain more power or

278
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,839
mistreat the users for its own advantage

279
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,250
which means putting malicious

280
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:21,010
functionalities into the program so

281
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,040
spying is a very common kind of

282
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:30,370
malicious functionality this example is

283
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:32,980
the Amazon swindle it's Amazon's ebook

284
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,800
reader which is designed to swindle

285
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,950
users out of the traditional freedoms of

286
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,589
readers of books for instance its spies

287
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,070
completely everything the user does is

288
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:47,560
reported to Amazon

289
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,980
the title of the book is reported to

290
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,839
Amazon if so even if the book was

291
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,140
obtained from someplace other than

292
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:02,620
Amazon Amazon still knows what book is

293
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:05,800
being read and it sends the page number

294
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,829
being read if the user highlights any

295
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:15,609
text or enters any notes they're sent to

296
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:21,430
Amazon but spying is very common in

297
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:24,490
non-free programs the five widely used

298
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:29,459
proprietary operating systems that means

299
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:33,120
Windows Mac us Android iOS and chromis

300
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:36,729
they all spy on the user and transmit

301
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,320
various personal information different

302
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,930
depending on which system flash player

303
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,870
has a functionality that enables

304
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:55,390
websites to recognize the user they're

305
00:16:46,870 --> 00:17:03,040
sometimes called super cookies and lots

306
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:08,139
of apps also spy even the flashlight app

307
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,540
in phones spies now you might wonder why

308
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,140
does it need to communicate over the

309
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,260
Internet to turn on the lamp what

310
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,500
information does

311
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,510
need none it's communicating only for

312
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,430
spying that's the only possible reason

313
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:28,640
it could be communicating but lots of

314
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:32,450
apps spy someone studied the hundreds of

315
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,910
most popular Android apps and found that

316
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,720
more than half of them were spying in an

317
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:41,630
obviously detectable way the rest maybe

318
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:50,570
they're spying too but not in the most

319
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:55,580
detectable way and of course streaming

320
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:58,189
apps such as Spotify and Netflix they

321
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,889
make users identify themselves and then

322
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:04,000
keep track of what the user is listen to

323
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:06,100
or watch this is the nastiest

324
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,400
conceivable kind of surveillance

325
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,919
surveillance of what people listen to or

326
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,360
watch it's like the Amazon swindle keep

327
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,400
that surveil what people read now this

328
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:27,370
ought to be a crime they should go into

329
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:30,200
prison for setting up such things and

330
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:35,439
then they're that at will so for this

331
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,440
reason I say out out damned spot if I I

332
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,940
won't listen to something through

333
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,790
Spotify or watch something through

334
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,460
Netflix even if it's on someone else's

335
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,980
computer because of course I won't have

336
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:53,000
a non-free program on my computer so I

337
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,870
couldn't possibly run it myself but even

338
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,940
if someone else were running it the idea

339
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:04,219
of tracking what people watch the idea

340
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,360
that something such as Netflix or

341
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:11,480
Spotify is allowed to exist makes me so

342
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,649
angry that I have no wish to listen to

343
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:20,480
or watch whatever it is I'd rather

344
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:24,710
refuse and then there are the

345
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,830
transportation apps such as goober

346
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:30,400
I call it goober because it pays drivers

347
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,399
peanuts

348
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:38,270
which is another reason to condemn it

349
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,620
but the direct injustice it does to

350
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:46,510
customers is tracking where people go

351
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:51,500
now I will use an ordinary taxi because

352
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:54,710
it doesn't know who I am and I pay cash

353
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,400
I don't identify myself goober won't

354
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,770
take cash and goober requires you to

355
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,980
identify yourself and run a non-free

356
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:08,150
program to ask for transportation that

357
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,250
means I will never be a customer of

358
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,520
goober

359
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:17,770
but goober runs at a loss trying to

360
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:22,070
eliminate its competition it behooves us

361
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,230
not to wait until that is successful

362
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,260
before we say how bad it is we've got to

363
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:31,160
start fighting back now we have to

364
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,160
campaign to get rid of goober and any

365
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:39,220
other companies that do the same wrongs

366
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:41,480
to their customers we have to campaign

367
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,410
proactively to get rid of those

368
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,750
companies just as they're campaigning

369
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:57,080
proactively to get rid of the ethical

370
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:59,840
alternatives now many products that are

371
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:05,439
manufactured with non free software also

372
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,689
spy on users they're tethered to servers

373
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,230
the Fitbit is a good example of this it

374
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,350
sends data to the companies the

375
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,320
manufacturers server it sends the users

376
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:23,360
personal data there and then the company

377
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:28,909
invites the user to buy it back what

378
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:33,370
goal but this is has become standard

379
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:35,780
practice in the internet of stings

380
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,260
products that are tethered to a

381
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:43,090
particular server run by the

382
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,090
manufacturer so it knows everything

383
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:49,029
think about it if you have a thermostat

384
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,760
that you talk to through the

385
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:56,149
manufacturers server or a camera Wi-Fi

386
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,240
device that talks that you talk to

387
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:02,928
through the manufacturers server or

388
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:08,600
these things exist there's even a sex

389
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:11,750
toy an internet controlled sex toy that

390
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,689
allows somebody who is not present to

391
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:20,029
send it commands now that might conceal

392
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:23,149
we be an enjoyable thing but when I saw

393
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:29,779
it in a store my first thought was this

394
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:32,570
is meant to spy on people and indeed

395
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:37,100
people discover it at at least one such

396
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,799
toy was spying on people because to send

397
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,539
it commands you had to go through the

398
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,340
manufacturers server so it would know if

399
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,100
the manufacturer would know everything

400
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,769
and not only that they designed the

401
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,850
product specifically to spy on people

402
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:56,779
they put in a thermometer now why does a

403
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:59,209
sex toy need a thermometer last time you

404
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:02,110
used a vibrator did you did it have a

405
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,990
temperature gauge I mean did you care

406
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:09,229
you had no reason to care the point is

407
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,570
the manufacturer wanted to know when the

408
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,320
product was in contact with a human body

409
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:20,090
and a thermos a thermometer gave him

410
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,668
that information well I think that Isis

411
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:26,720
I speculate that the manufacturer could

412
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:28,730
also tell what kind of contact was being

413
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:37,669
made with a human body from the

414
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:42,019
thermometer so I was my suspicions were

415
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:45,470
proved right be suspicious of any device

416
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:50,389
that is meant to talk to users through

417
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,559
the manufacturers server that is malware

418
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:58,168
in itself

419
00:23:52,559 --> 00:24:03,629
don't allow it into your house mmm

420
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:06,780
there was a comedian who joked a woman

421
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:10,799
came up to me and said did I see you on

422
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:18,059
TV and I told her sorry we can't see out

423
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:18,929
from the other side except that now with

424
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:26,129
a so-called

425
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:28,799
Smart TV they can they're totally

426
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:35,220
vicious things I wouldn't allow one in

427
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:42,720
my house and some of them are listening

428
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:46,049
as well oh there's a home security

429
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,260
camera that was designed for the user to

430
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:52,470
watch through it through the

431
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,690
manufacturers server and at one or maybe

432
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,549
originally the user could watch it

433
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:01,830
directly but at some point the

434
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:04,650
manufacturer made changes and users the

435
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,230
user could only watch it by making an

436
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,870
account on the manufacturers server

437
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,200
which means that the manufacturer was

438
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:17,610
watching everything in the users house

439
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,929
that the user could watch you got to

440
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:25,799
expect non-free software nowadays to be

441
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,570
malicious now these are just some

442
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,160
examples of the malicious

443
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:35,720
functionalities we see there's also

444
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,640
digital restrictions management DRM

445
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,270
where they design products to restrict

446
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,049
the user

447
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:46,080
there are backdoors the Amazon swindle

448
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:50,720
has a backdoor for remote erasure of

449
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:55,559
books which was used in 2009 to erase

450
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,919
thousands of copies of 1984 by George

451
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,918
Orwell

452
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,830
I mean if I were writing fiction I

453
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,169
wouldn't have dared to put that in it

454
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:13,510
would it would not have been plausible

455
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:17,120
it just happens to have been true now

456
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:23,510
imagine what a back door would do in a

457
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:25,549
driverless car imagine if they use the

458
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,340
back door to tell the car to go to

459
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:32,720
secret police headquarters with the

460
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:36,350
doors locked now you can be sure that

461
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,960
China will do this we can expect that

462
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:43,309
some other countries such as Russia and

463
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,640
Turkey will do this will the u.s. do

464
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:50,230
this could we really say where we're

465
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,890
confident it won't I don't think so we

466
00:26:50,230 --> 00:27:00,100
must regard any driverless car with a

467
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:03,559
back door as terribly dangerous not just

468
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:09,500
dangerous to oneself but dangerous to

469
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:13,639
democracy and they're already designing

470
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:17,030
the back door I posted a link to an

471
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,500
article about a company that's designing

472
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:24,470
the software for remote-control driving

473
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,030
that's part of the plan it's not mere

474
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:34,000
speculation it's not a mere possibility

475
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:38,690
it's part of the plan to make these into

476
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,870
traps for the secret police and then

477
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:45,140
there's censorship of apps Apple

478
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:48,168
pioneered this Apple used to practice

479
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:52,330
its censorship power arbitrarily for its

480
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:57,080
own commercial and political interests

481
00:27:52,330 --> 00:28:01,939
until about a year ago China ordered

482
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:06,049
Apple to block VPN applications an Apple

483
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:11,120
found it was compelled to obey China and

484
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:12,200
censor for China if Apple had made the I

485
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,658
monsters

486
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,840
like all previous computers where users

487
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:20,210
could install the applications of their

488
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,379
choice then Apple would have had a

489
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:28,130
response to China but China we can't

490
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:31,429
control what users install I'm sorry or

491
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:34,399
we would I would just I would love to do

492
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:38,630
what you want but I have no ability

493
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:41,570
please forgive me but because Apple gave

494
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:48,970
itself that power it had no response

495
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:53,080
except to start censoring for China and

496
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:56,450
then there is the universal backdoor

497
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:01,779
Windows has a universal backdoor since

498
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:05,630
Windows XP was discovered in Windows XP

499
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:08,480
that Microsoft could change the software

500
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,370
remotely at any time Microsoft would not

501
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,950
admit this but with Windows Vista

502
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:18,379
Microsoft proudly announced this

503
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,360
Universal backdoor under a nice sounding

504
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:25,880
name instead of calling it a universal

505
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:28,459
backdoor it called it auto upgrade or

506
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,120
auto downgrade depending on your opinion

507
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:36,260
of the change that's forced on you we

508
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:41,658
also know of Universal backdoors in the

509
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:45,408
Amazon swindle in the Wii U I suspect

510
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:48,139
that some Smart TVs have Universal

511
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:51,110
backdoors but the home security camera

512
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:55,039
had a universal backdoor there is even

513
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:58,549
pressure for companies to send security

514
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,700
upgrades meaning to put in a universal

515
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:08,059
backdoor and use it to change the

516
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:12,169
software now I think it's fine if a

517
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:15,529
product has the ability to receive

518
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:18,559
security upgrades from somebody of your

519
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:22,850
choice and then you could set it up to

520
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,590
receive those to one of the various

521
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:29,310
companies that has chosen to maintain

522
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:32,370
the free software in the product this is

523
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,770
a way we could get the security the

524
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:41,510
general level of security of devices

525
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:46,379
improved without giving anybody

526
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:49,650
intolerable power over anybody now often

527
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,620
you find many malicious functionalities

528
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:56,340
together for instance Netflix keeps

529
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,330
track of what users are watching it

530
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:03,570
makes a dossier for each user now this

531
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:06,419
is intolerable it should be illegal in

532
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,899
addition it implements DRM digital

533
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:13,740
restrictions management and it requires

534
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,550
users to sign an anti socializing

535
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:22,970
contract what does that mean it's also

536
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:25,970
known as an end-user License Agreement

537
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:28,530
but the reason I call it anti

538
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,620
socializing is that it's the opposite of

539
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:34,590
what we want schools and parents to do

540
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,020
to children we speak of socializing them

541
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:40,040
teaching them to be good to other people

542
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,460
to be helpful and cooperate with others

543
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:46,889
this contract is the exact opposite a

544
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:51,120
user agreeing to this contract promises

545
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:54,450
not to share copies meaning be a bad

546
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,120
member of society not to lend the one

547
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:00,060
copy to anybody else meaning be an even

548
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,070
worse member of society and not to give

549
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,080
that copy to anybody else

550
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,929
meaning be an even worse member of

551
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,050
society you can also call it a jerk

552
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:12,480
making contract because it's a contract

553
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,180
that pressure where people promise to be

554
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,840
jerks and unfortunately some of them

555
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:22,110
will actually go through with it now if

556
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,240
you have agreed to such a contract that

557
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:27,000
is no excuse for being a jerk your

558
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,340
obligations for being a good member of

559
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,230
society are unchanged you have to break

560
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:36,449
the contract but I don't like agreeing

561
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,750
to a contract that I know I will be

562
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,680
morally obligated to break

563
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:51,610
I don't agree with to them I check if

564
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:55,310
anything wants that I don't agree so in

565
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:58,840
Ghana org slash malware you can find

566
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:01,700
hundreds of examples of malicious

567
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,610
functionalities in proprietary programs

568
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:09,290
oh and I didn't mention some of the

569
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:14,090
worst in importable phones every

570
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:16,220
portable phone reports where it is every

571
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,320
few minutes it sends out a signal so

572
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,750
that the phone towers can receive it and

573
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,689
know how to communicate with the phone

574
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,660
now this wasn't this functionality

575
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,030
wasn't set up for malicious tracking

576
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,990
it's necessary for the system to work

577
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:38,260
and tracking is just a byproduct but

578
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:41,150
it's still unacceptable but even worse

579
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,180
the processor that talks to the radio

580
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:46,640
network the modem processor generally

581
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,710
has a universal backdoor with which they

582
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,530
can change the software and convert it

583
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,200
into a listening device that listens

584
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,920
full time and transmits all the

585
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,120
conversations it hears and if and you

586
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,860
don't have to speak right into the

587
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,500
microphone because remember it has

588
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,899
speakerphone functionality it can turn

589
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,570
that on anytime and listen to all the

590
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,480
conversations in the room and transmit

591
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,639
them in fact if there's anybody here

592
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,679
who's carrying a portable tracking and

593
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,159
surveillance device it could be

594
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,200
listening to my talk right now

595
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:25,159
not that I mind this talks going to be

596
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:28,219
posted anyway anybody's welcome as far

597
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,870
as I'm concerned to listen to it but

598
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,850
keep in mind that your private

599
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,239
conversations could be listened to this

600
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:38,870
way as well

601
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:41,658
now there is a plan to develop a phone

602
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:48,440
that will resist these malicious things

603
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:49,690
as much as is possible so the microphone

604
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,270
won't become

605
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,339
to the modem processor it'll be

606
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,559
connected to the application processor

607
00:34:54,339 --> 00:35:00,009
which is the computer that runs a free

608
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:03,280
operating system and in that machine it

609
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,109
will be a free operating system so if if

610
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,970
things are working well you'll be able

611
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,480
to stop them from turning it into a

612
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,689
listening device and there will also be

613
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,880
a switch to turn off the power to the

614
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:19,030
modem processor so you can be sure it's

615
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,460
off an ordinary mobile phone doesn't

616
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,220
have an off switch

617
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:29,380
it has a button you can push which says

618
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:32,919
oh sir telephone please be so kind as to

619
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:37,420
turn yourself off and then maybe it does

620
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,160
and maybe it doesn't so this phone will

621
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,430
be better but there's one thing there's

622
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,848
no way to stop and that is if it doesn't

623
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:48,160
send out signals forward to find it

624
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:50,890
every so often there's no way the

625
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,690
network can send calls or messages to

626
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:58,089
you and but if you have it off so people

627
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,109
can't send calls or messages to you it's

628
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:05,910
not very useful I've only thought of one

629
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:09,339
way to make it acceptable to use a

630
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:11,890
portable phone make a have a portable

631
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:14,920
phone such that there'd be a way that I

632
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:19,150
could make it useful without having it

633
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:22,089
be tracking me and that is keep it off

634
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,460
almost all the time and carry a one-way

635
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:26,950
pager so people could inform me when

636
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,010
they're trying to reach me and that way

637
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:34,509
I could judge based on what they said in

638
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:37,059
the pager when how urgent it is and I

639
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:41,799
could determine when I should turn the

640
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:45,279
phone on and thus reveal my location I'm

641
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:49,450
not sure one-way pagers exist anymore

642
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:53,440
I mean I I heard a rumor recently that

643
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:57,069
they don't they do oh good well then

644
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:00,520
maybe I'll actually get one it would be

645
00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:02,779
interesting to say see here's what I

646
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,479
have the phone and the pager

647
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:10,689
and this is how I made it possible for

648
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:10,689
me to have a portable phone that isn't

649
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:18,409
intolerably sir ailing me it would be

650
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,739
nice if every portable phone if there

651
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:25,130
were a standard one-way paging system

652
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:29,209
and every phone could come with that as

653
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:35,259
well it could be built-in it would be

654
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:38,299
much cheaper that way anyway

655
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:42,049
we've got hundreds of examples of this

656
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:44,179
if you're using proprietary software

657
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:51,709
you're almost certainly using

658
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:54,079
proprietary malware and there's a poem

659
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:56,499
that I'm thinking that I'd like to read

660
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,499
to you

661
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:27,029
so this is called what Mary had maybe

662
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,790
you can actually read it off that mary

663
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:33,150
had a little lamb' p' in a moat with

664
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:35,730
them on a motion-sensing switch and this

665
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:39,540
at night when Mary moved highlighted

666
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:42,420
every twitch mary had a little phone

667
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,029
that tracked her everywhere and every

668
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,950
word that mary spoke the state was sure

669
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:53,220
to hear mary had a little car with

670
00:38:49,950 --> 00:39:01,200
cellular modem built and everywhere that

671
00:38:53,220 --> 00:39:04,200
car did go her personal data spilt Mary

672
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,279
had a TV set that watched her watching

673
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:13,049
it a jackass cracked its backdoor key to

674
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:16,430
photograph her tit they've gone too far

675
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:19,440
cried Mary's rage when a TV set is lewd

676
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:23,220
that's how she learned with non free

677
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,920
code there's mischief being brewed neat

678
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:29,640
I described her watch her stove her

679
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:34,730
fridge her thermostats they're all alike

680
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:38,640
smart booby traps laid out by plutocrats

681
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:41,310
Mary trashed those networked things her

682
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,640
software now is free she fights for

683
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:46,849
freedom night and day so free we all can

684
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,848
be

685
00:39:51,070 --> 00:40:02,830
and you can find that on Stallman dot

686
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:02,830
org I believe so

687
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:11,890
non-free software is one of the primary

688
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:16,640
means of tracking and surveilling people

689
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:20,600
but it is not the only one digital

690
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,940
services often track people because to

691
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,670
use them you have to give data and then

692
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:31,090
they probably demand some other general

693
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:33,800
personal data just because they can and

694
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:38,920
as a result they're collecting lots of

695
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:43,010
data about people you can still pay for

696
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:45,350
the New York City subway anonymously but

697
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,590
they're trying to make it so convenient

698
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:52,299
to give them a bank card and then they

699
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,300
know who you are and where you get on

700
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,790
hmm and then Amtrak is even worse you

701
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,410
can't buy a ticket on Amtrak without

702
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:12,870
showing ID they shouldn't have any right

703
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:15,390
to demand ID from people they shouldn't

704
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:24,319
have a right to identify people except

705
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:28,470
based on specific need um now even if

706
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,540
uber communicated with your with your

707
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:33,990
browser and you could use a free browser

708
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,990
it would still demand that you identify

709
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:41,580
yourself and you'd still have to pay in

710
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:43,890
a way that identified you so your own

711
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,460
software would not be snooping on you

712
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:50,250
but the uber server would be and that

713
00:41:47,460 --> 00:42:00,690
has the same result that it would make a

714
00:41:50,250 --> 00:42:04,980
dossier of your movements hmm ISPs track

715
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:08,220
people now this became people became

716
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:13,470
more aware of this when the bullshitters

717
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:18,470
men cancelled the rule about how the ISP

718
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:21,660
could make use of this information but

719
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:26,609
limiting how they for instance it

720
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,290
couldn't be used to advertise but it was

721
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,590
still there and it could be used in

722
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:35,880
other ways so the regulation that they

723
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:39,270
got rid of didn't protect people it just

724
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,040
was a it just slightly limited the harm

725
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:44,360
that could be done with that information

726
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,700
that they shouldn't be collecting at all

727
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:51,990
likewise phone companies keep track of

728
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,419
who you call and who calls you they keep

729
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:57,620
track of your location if you're

730
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:00,390
carrying a portable phone it's sending a

731
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,730
location signal a localization signal

732
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:06,359
every few minutes and they're keeping

733
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,090
track of it one of the first things we

734
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:16,390
learned from Snowden's revelations

735
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:19,240
that AT&T I believe it was was or was

736
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:22,240
some phone long-distance company in the

737
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,939
US was telling the US government about

738
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,459
every call that was made and had been

739
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,460
doing so for something like twenty years

740
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,560
it's more like this way so

741
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:55,170
protecting us from surveillance includes

742
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,990
limiting what those services can collect

743
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,350
and of course there are also systems

744
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:04,049
that exist purely to track people such

745
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:07,980
as the license plate recognition cameras

746
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:11,760
the track movement of cars and face

747
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:15,510
recognition cameras maybe now that track

748
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,880
people around the city now those are

749
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:23,850
systems that we don't use at all they

750
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:27,360
exist only to track us in the case of

751
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:30,270
non-free software Fetzer veils us we can

752
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:34,950
protect ourselves by rejecting the non

753
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:37,020
free software but with the systems we

754
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:43,500
don't own we can't solve the problem

755
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:46,770
that way the ISPs computer the cable

756
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,140
companies computers the phone companies

757
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:52,320
computers in the phone exchange they

758
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:54,089
don't belong to us maybe they're running

759
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,490
free software but they're not running

760
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:59,460
our copies they're running the company's

761
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,649
copies I hope they are they are running

762
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,670
free software that company should have

763
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:08,760
control of its own computing - I hope

764
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,710
that your phone company has not made the

765
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,420
stupid mistake of running non-free

766
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:16,770
software controlled by some other

767
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:20,670
company but that has no effect on

768
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:24,000
whether it can mistreat us we can't

769
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:29,010
protect ourselves from those kinds of

770
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,400
surveillance individually we have to do

771
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:39,350
it politically we have to organize to

772
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,350
put an end to massive surveillance now

773
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:50,180
massive surveillance has gone farther

774
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:54,710
than you might even realize I believe it

775
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:57,109
Detroit where the cops have invited

776
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:01,240
businesses to set up cameras that the

777
00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:01,240
cops can watch through at any time

778
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,410
basically suggesting if you don't do

779
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,240
this

780
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:12,379
9-1-1 calls will come slow

781
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,169
911 one response will be slow so you

782
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,970
better let us spy on your customers it

783
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,180
should be illegal for them to spy on

784
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:22,700
anybody's customers that way it should

785
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:26,169
be illegal to set up such a feed that's

786
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,819
available to anyone but yourself

787
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:31,520
not looking at a place where the public

788
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,369
is admitted in the inside of your house

789
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,200
if you want to okay

790
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,930
but in a store where the public is

791
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,770
invited to come and buy that should be

792
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,140
that should be a crime to spy on them

793
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:48,589
like that and then there are some places

794
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,589
where they've set up there was a town I

795
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:55,009
read where they set up cameras looking

796
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:57,349
at certain parts of the town on a public

797
00:46:55,010 --> 00:47:00,619
feed and said everybody watch through

798
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:02,390
this looking for any possible crimes now

799
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:04,310
the people who live around there don't

800
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:08,200
like it because they're being watched

801
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,200
all the time by they don't know who

802
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:22,020
we can't protect ourselves from

803
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,410
surveillance one by one well there's

804
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:28,470
certain amount you can do I run tor to

805
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:33,000
browse and also to connect to the FSF

806
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:39,029
server so that it can't be told where I

807
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,210
am coming from so that that protects me

808
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:44,670
from one kind of surveillance and of

809
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,609
course communicating through SSH I'm

810
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:55,130
protected from some other kinds of

811
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:58,500
surveillance but but that's only partial

812
00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:04,830
the only way we can recover our privacy

813
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:07,770
is by organizing for legislation when we

814
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:10,290
design this legislation we have to look

815
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:13,680
at the problem scenarios we need to

816
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:17,850
avoid and then ask would these policies

817
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,919
succeed in preventing the problems what

818
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:22,440
we would find is that most of the

819
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,500
remedies being proposed don't come

820
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,330
anywhere near doing the job basically

821
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,450
the people proposing them are not

822
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:33,840
starting from a problem to be solved or

823
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:38,460
if they are it's a problem only of the

824
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,290
sort of profiling for advertisements but

825
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,800
they tend to make the mistake of

826
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:48,420
assuming that it's only bad to profile

827
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:50,630
people if they don't give consent but

828
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,890
actually that's a completely inadequate

829
00:48:50,630 --> 00:49:00,060
criterion because businesses have become

830
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:01,230
expert at manufacturing consent now

831
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:06,060
that's a joke of course

832
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:07,980
I'm copying a phrase from Chomsky but he

833
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,130
was talking about a different kind of

834
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,460
consent I'm talking about consent for

835
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:15,990
your personal data to be collected

836
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,080
businesses are expert at manufacturing

837
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:22,020
that kind of consent all they have to do

838
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,940
is say in order to have this service you

839
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,570
have to give us this personal data and

840
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,570
you want the service right you can

841
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:31,520
live without it your friends have it how

842
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:35,900
could you possibly live without it

843
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:40,960
your friends won't like you anymore so

844
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:44,900
people consent if we want to stop this

845
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,510
profiling we have to propose a solution

846
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,870
that's adequate to actually stop it and

847
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:56,620
that solution takes the form companies

848
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:56,620
you're not allowed to ask for these data

849
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,959
we have to be firm and strict with them

850
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:08,900
we have to say no you can't ask for this

851
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,510
data you can't collect this data you

852
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:19,280
want to offer people rides no you can't

853
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:25,160
ask who they are you can't keep track of

854
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:34,700
who goes where you can't recognize the

855
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:37,310
faces of people on the street so we have

856
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,330
to look at the problems that we need to

857
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:44,360
prevent and then design solutions that

858
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:48,590
are adequate to do the job so what are

859
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:52,190
the problems well one problem as we now

860
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:55,550
know is profiling people which makes

861
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:58,000
people victim makes people vulnerable to

862
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:02,060
various kinds of advertising

863
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,060
manipulation we have discovered that

864
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,670
this made it possible for Russia to

865
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:12,250
manipulate the u.s. election to

866
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:17,570
manipulate the UK's referendum on

867
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:20,830
leaving the European Union it's

868
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:23,750
basically it makes society vulnerable

869
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:27,470
but it's not only vulnerable to Russia

870
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,240
of course Russia is just one party that

871
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:32,080
took advantage of this lots of

872
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,450
businesses are taking advantage of this

873
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,840
planet roasters the billionaires that

874
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:40,009
want to destroy civilization by stopping

875
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,500
us for

876
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:45,440
curbing global heating until we're

877
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:49,750
doomed they're taking advantage of it

878
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,760
too they have lots of money to spend and

879
00:51:49,750 --> 00:52:08,470
they're spending it in every way they

880
00:51:52,760 --> 00:52:12,110
can think of to achieve this goal so I

881
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:15,589
put it to you that we need to put an end

882
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:17,590
to those systems of profiling or at

883
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:21,800
least make sure that they are not

884
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:24,950
suitable or or available for this kind

885
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,590
of use no matter by whom doesn't matter

886
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:31,220
whether it's Russia forget for the

887
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:36,470
moment that it what Russia was one of

888
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:45,529
them it's just as bad if it's John Q

889
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:50,180
billionaire another threat is the threat

890
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:55,520
to whistleblowers which means again a

891
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:58,120
threat to democracy democracy means that

892
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,190
the people control the state's actions

893
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,830
but in order to control them we have to

894
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:06,410
know what they are States have a habit

895
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:08,450
of acting secretly and concealing what

896
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:10,970
they're doing how do we know what the

897
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:14,899
states doing thanks to whistleblowers

898
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:16,970
who tell us but the state tends to call

899
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,300
the whistleblower a traitor and a spy

900
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:23,390
and put the whistleblower in prison if

901
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,940
it can identify the whistleblower and

902
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:32,330
how can it identify the whistleblower

903
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:34,490
through massive surveillance so we need

904
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:37,210
to make sure of a surveillance it does

905
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:40,040
not enable the state to identify

906
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:42,710
whistleblowers if the state knows who

907
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,650
goes we're and who talks with whom then

908
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:53,120
it can identify the whistleblower

909
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:54,300
reliably therefore we need to make sure

910
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,670
that

911
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:03,730
databases do not collect who goes where

912
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:07,570
and who talks with whom but how can we

913
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:10,450
stop this well the usual proposals are

914
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:14,050
to regulate the use of the data once

915
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:17,348
collected but we know that that won't do

916
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:21,390
the job and the reason is that the state

917
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:25,180
can either ignore these regulations or

918
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:28,390
put a loophole into them it'll say it

919
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:30,970
for instance the regulations will surely

920
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:35,170
say that the state can use the data to

921
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:38,379
find criminals and by accusing the

922
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:40,390
whistleblower of a crime that's an if

923
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,190
that's an excuse the state can now look

924
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:47,819
at all the data and identify the

925
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:50,560
whistleblower so that won't do the job

926
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,990
we need to make sure that the database

927
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,529
doesn't have the data that would be

928
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:59,078
required to identify the whistleblowers

929
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:02,170
which means we need to regulate not the

930
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:06,130
use of the data but the collection and

931
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:09,670
the accumulation of the data if the data

932
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:12,579
is not being accumulated now then

933
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:17,680
there's no way the state can find a

934
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:20,160
whistleblower today of course a

935
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,500
tyrannical state could always change

936
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,560
these laws and start collecting data but

937
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:31,150
it would only get data from that point

938
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:34,089
on there's nothing we can do by laws

939
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,849
that would prevent a tyrannical state

940
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:39,849
willing and able to change laws from

941
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:43,390
arising in the future but if we can

942
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:45,520
legislate today that they can't have

943
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,430
systems which are collecting data about

944
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,650
people then even if next year a

945
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:55,500
tyrannical state decides to throw this

946
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:55,500
away it won't have data about this year

947
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:04,000
so that's what we need to do but to make

948
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,169
it a bit harder we can legislate that

949
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,130
the system

950
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:11,579
be designed in such a way that they

951
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:16,960
don't collect any data they could

952
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:19,869
possibly not collect the law has to say

953
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,930
if there is any way you could do this

954
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:24,880
job without collecting personal data or

955
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:27,700
without collecting more than this much

956
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,240
personal data then you must design the

957
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,529
system to do it that way

958
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,879
minimizing the amount of data collected

959
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:39,460
has to be an overriding priority when it

960
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,599
comes to selecting how the system should

961
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:47,710
work in March I went to France and I

962
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:50,950
visited a city where to pay to park you

963
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:56,770
must punch in your license plate number

964
00:56:50,950 --> 00:57:00,660
in the parking meter so their parking

965
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:04,660
system is a total surveillance system

966
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:06,879
their parking lots in the UK which work

967
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,970
the same way I read about this because

968
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,069
they were also cheating people and

969
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:16,328
people were complaining to the newspaper

970
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:18,700
but what when I read that my thought was

971
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:24,750
the worst thing about this is that it's

972
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:28,480
keeping track of who parked there now

973
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:31,690
governments may have laws about the use

974
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,470
of data once that's been collected but

975
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:37,750
they tend to throw these laws away

976
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:41,950
precipitously whenever there's a

977
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:48,040
convenient terrorist attack so the u.s.

978
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:51,640
after September 2001 passed the Pat riot

979
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:54,040
Act which says that the FBI I'm not

980
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,078
willing to call that law patriotic it's

981
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,650
the opposite of patriotic for an

982
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,650
American

983
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:10,980
um the Pat riot act or sometimes I call

984
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:14,160
it the you SAP at riot act because

985
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:18,329
that's its full name you see it's an

986
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,609
acronym the name is an acronym and so we

987
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:25,789
are to divide this list of letters up

988
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:29,279
into words is entirely arbitrary anyway

989
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:31,859
so that law says the FBI can collect

990
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,069
essentially any database of personal

991
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:42,390
data just by saying we wanted no need

992
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:47,250
even for a court order I say that laws

993
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:50,009
should should forbid surveillance

994
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:52,829
systems expand forbid the collection of

995
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:56,670
data except in specific times and places

996
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:58,230
when a court orders collection because

997
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,780
you do it you have to have that

998
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:03,029
possibility because we want the state to

999
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:07,049
investigate crimes and catch criminals

1000
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:10,890
but we don't want the systems to provide

1001
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:13,770
what adds up to massive surveillance so

1002
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:19,650
the court should have to allow

1003
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:21,210
surveillance over here or else they're

1004
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,420
not there's not allowed to be

1005
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:36,529
surveillance over here

1006
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:40,380
so so the point is parking lots and

1007
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:43,980
cities should not be allowed to set up

1008
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:47,400
parking payment systems that keep track

1009
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:49,470
of who's there those systems should be

1010
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,319
forbidden they should have to do it some

1011
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:55,709
other way even if it costs a little more

1012
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,650
and is not quite so convenient we know

1013
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:05,490
that those systems can work they existed

1014
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:07,170
they were used 20 even 50 years ago by

1015
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:10,680
the way did you know that the Greeks had

1016
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:14,890
a goddess of parking

1017
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:31,078
if you parked in an unlucky place you

1018
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:35,078
had to make an offering to Demeter now

1019
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:38,140
one way we can protect from massive

1020
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:41,140
surveillance is by not centralizing the

1021
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:45,058
data consider the kind of security

1022
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:47,740
cameras that we used say 30 years ago

1023
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:51,160
you put up a camera it makes her

1024
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:54,578
recording someplace nearby on a physical

1025
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,910
device if a crime happens then you go

1026
01:00:54,579 --> 01:01:00,040
there and you copy the recording

1027
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:05,828
otherwise it gets overwritten after some

1028
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:08,410
weeks automatically now the work that

1029
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:12,400
would be involved in copying all those

1030
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:16,118
recordings regularly all the time is so

1031
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,599
great that it won't be done as a result

1032
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:22,059
those security cameras did not lead to

1033
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,549
massive surveillance they were safe as

1034
01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:29,559
regards surveillance but they did

1035
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:32,740
provide some useful security now

1036
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:36,369
consider an internet-connected camera

1037
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:39,399
that can be watched by the state all the

1038
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:42,549
time or whenever it wants to maybe it's

1039
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,490
going to a fusion center maybe they're

1040
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:48,579
making a recording maybe they can search

1041
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:52,919
that recording for faces anytime they

1042
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:56,200
want you see once the once the video

1043
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:59,020
goes off the site once the camera is

1044
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:01,660
connected to any kind of network or

1045
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:04,119
means to transmit the video to someplace

1046
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:07,859
else you can't be sure it won't be

1047
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:11,380
recorded there so I would say let's

1048
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:15,549
legislatively require that these cameras

1049
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:18,460
only make a local recording get

1050
01:02:15,549 --> 01:02:23,420
ourselves some security against crimes

1051
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:28,069
without exposing our selves to

1052
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:30,670
massive surveillance what about face

1053
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:34,910
recognition or license-plate recognition

1054
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:38,569
systems there is some justification for

1055
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:42,020
license plate recognition systems if we

1056
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:44,990
make them safe how can we do that we

1057
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:48,319
have to legislate which license plates

1058
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:51,020
they can see there should be a list of

1059
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:53,000
license plates which are being sought

1060
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:58,369
and how does a plate get in there a

1061
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,260
court order puts it in there so then you

1062
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:03,410
can have any number of license plate

1063
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:06,859
recognizing cameras you like as long as

1064
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:09,770
they can only recognize the plate

1065
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:12,440
numbers that are in that database or

1066
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:16,040
invalid plates because basically if the

1067
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:19,280
camera sees a crime like driving with an

1068
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:23,750
invalid license plate it's okay if it

1069
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:27,349
recognizes that so the point is this way

1070
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:31,069
if somebody who the court hasn't ordered

1071
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:33,710
a search for if some car like that isn't

1072
01:03:31,069 --> 01:03:37,520
being sought drives by the camera will

1073
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:42,109
say what car I don't see a car there's

1074
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:44,780
no car there but if somebody who is

1075
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:48,740
being sought by court order drives by

1076
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:52,400
the camera will see it and will send out

1077
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:55,848
an alarm or whatever this way again we

1078
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,950
have a system that provides security but

1079
01:03:55,849 --> 01:04:01,970
does not contribute to massive

1080
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:04,629
surveillance but we have to be careful

1081
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:08,419
we don't want them to be able to put

1082
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:11,540
every government employees license plate

1083
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:15,859
into that database it's got to be done

1084
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:20,839
by court order based on some grounds for

1085
01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:26,049
suspicion and we don't want them putting

1086
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:26,049
in every reporters license plate either

1087
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:32,619
because that's exactly the sort of thing

1088
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:34,939
that they will do if they can put a

1089
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:36,610
government employee together with a

1090
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:44,980
reporter they can

1091
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:48,880
suspect a whistleblower what about face

1092
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:51,580
recognition itself we need to limit the

1093
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:56,130
video feeds and we need to limit the

1094
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:58,509
faces that can go in the database so

1095
01:04:56,130 --> 01:05:00,970
faces to go in a face recognition

1096
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:03,150
database they should only go in there by

1097
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:06,700
court order

1098
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:13,750
so yeah they can put in the faces of

1099
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:16,180
criminals being sought and that's it but

1100
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:19,390
also the video has to be limited because

1101
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:22,390
just having a enough people watching all

1102
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:26,710
the videos leads to an oppressive

1103
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:29,020
panopticon state so we need to we need

1104
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:32,680
the legislation about the cameras and

1105
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:34,870
about face recognition now these laws

1106
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,270
have to apply to the systems no matter

1107
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:42,460
who runs them whether it's a company a

1108
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:51,640
person or a government they should all

1109
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:55,090
be covered working this way we can make

1110
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,220
systems that don't massively surveil now

1111
01:05:55,090 --> 01:06:01,210
there are some systems which are a bit

1112
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:04,740
tricky for instance what about borrowing

1113
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:07,840
books from a library well the library

1114
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:13,990
only needs to know who borrowed the book

1115
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:17,530
if the book is overdue until the book is

1116
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:21,490
overdue it doesn't have to care so

1117
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:24,640
here's an idea I suggested when somebody

1118
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:27,700
borrows a book encrypt it and send it to

1119
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,980
a company in some other country that

1120
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:32,230
will keep it and will send it back to

1121
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,620
the library at a certain date when the

1122
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:38,050
book is overdue except that if a book

1123
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:40,180
comes in the library sends to that

1124
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:44,860
company the book came in and forget

1125
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:48,580
about that book and this way it won't be

1126
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:53,850
possible for the state to come in and

1127
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:53,850
take the list of all borrowing records

1128
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:09,820
what about bicycles for higher if the

1129
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:13,839
bicycles have a dock it's possible to

1130
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:16,300
design a system so that they don't know

1131
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,190
so that it checks that the person with a

1132
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:25,180
valid card to use the bicycles is

1133
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:27,490
they're taking the bicycle out but such

1134
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:30,940
that if the bicycle gets returned

1135
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:34,209
anywhere that sends a message around the

1136
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:37,060
network so that every so that the place

1137
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:40,150
the dock where the bicycle was borrowed

1138
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:45,730
initially finds out the bicycle was

1139
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:48,670
returned and then it forgets but if the

1140
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:52,170
bicycle doesn't get returned eventually

1141
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:55,570
the dock where it was borrowed from says

1142
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:57,790
bicycle numbers such-and-such has not

1143
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:00,610
gone has not been returned it's missing

1144
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:07,750
and so and so is the one who borrowed it

1145
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:11,050
so decentralizing data and arranging not

1146
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:13,360
to centralize it except in the cases

1147
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:16,330
where it really needs to be centralized

1148
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,400
if that's a small fraction of cases if

1149
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:21,339
those are unusual situations where

1150
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,740
something's going wrong well this way

1151
01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:27,250
you can avoid putting any data into the

1152
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:36,870
central database or when things are

1153
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:39,729
operating correctly and normally now

1154
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:42,519
there would still occasionally be

1155
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:45,339
information about some people's actions

1156
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:48,850
but it would be a small enough fraction

1157
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:53,260
of the use that it wouldn't be effective

1158
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:58,060
for any kind of massive surveillance so

1159
01:08:53,260 --> 01:09:00,640
it's not harmful in other words we don't

1160
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:02,259
need to reduce the collection of

1161
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,829
personal data to

1162
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:09,939
exactly zero we need to keep it small

1163
01:09:05,828 --> 01:09:12,698
enough that it isn't dangerous we need

1164
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:31,268
to have less surveillance than we had in

1165
01:09:12,698 --> 01:09:40,000
the Soviet Union so oh oh oh so I see

1166
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:43,059
that my robe inhale oh oh oh yes it

1167
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,960
might be fun to present to you my other

1168
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:45,960
identity

1169
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:55,869
I am st. Ignace of the church of emacs I

1170
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:55,869
bless your computer my child

1171
01:10:56,349 --> 01:11:02,630
Emacs started out as an extensible text

1172
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:05,119
editor that I had written which then

1173
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:07,340
became a way of life for many users as

1174
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,710
they had extended it so much they could

1175
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,050
do all their computing inside Emacs

1176
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:16,550
without ever leaving without ever

1177
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:18,469
leaving it and then it became a church

1178
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:23,960
with the launch of the news group alt

1179
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:27,380
dot religion Emacs I'm say it to say it

1180
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:30,079
appears that the news group has ceased

1181
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:34,730
to be used it used to be used for

1182
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:37,549
posting various kinds of wordplay and if

1183
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:42,619
you start using it for that again it

1184
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:46,969
would be so nice I never saw it myself

1185
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:55,730
because I've never read net news in any

1186
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:58,010
fashion you see with so much work to do

1187
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:00,138
there were just various areas of

1188
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:02,900
activities that I chose not to get

1189
01:12:00,139 --> 01:12:04,699
involved with them with at all and that

1190
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:12,679
meant I didn't have to learn how to do

1191
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:15,678
them so much time saved in the Church of

1192
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:18,949
Emacs we have a great sysm between

1193
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:22,219
several rival versions of Emacs and we

1194
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:24,829
also have Saints but fortunately no gods

1195
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:30,320
instead of gods we adore the one true

1196
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:33,559
editor Emacs to be a member of the

1197
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,079
Church of Emacs you must recite the

1198
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:39,860
confession of the faith you must say

1199
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,349
there is no system but goo and Linux is

1200
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:46,080
one of

1201
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:48,360
it's kernels then if you become a true

1202
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:55,350
expert you can celebrate that with our

1203
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:57,960
ceremony the foo bar mitzvah in which

1204
01:12:55,350 --> 01:13:00,750
you chant a portion of our sacred

1205
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:05,250
scriptures that is to say the system

1206
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:07,650
source code in the church of emacs we

1207
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:11,160
have eliminated the priesthood of

1208
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:16,980
technology because everyone is welcome

1209
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:20,150
to read our sacred scriptures we also

1210
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:23,040
have the cult of the Virgin of Emax

1211
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:28,710
which means anyone who has never known

1212
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:30,990
or used Emacs and according to the

1213
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:36,500
church of emacs offering the opportunity

1214
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:39,599
to lose Emacs virginity is a blessed act

1215
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:41,730
we also have the Emacs pilgrimage which

1216
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,470
consists of invoking all the commands of

1217
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:50,250
Emacs in alphabetical order there is a

1218
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:51,930
breakaway Tibetan sect which claims that

1219
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,820
it's sufficient to invoke them

1220
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:58,860
automatically under the control of a

1221
01:13:53,820 --> 01:14:00,929
script but the Mother Church holds that

1222
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:05,429
to gain spiritual merit you must type

1223
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:07,440
them by hand the Church of Emacs has

1224
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:10,170
certain advantages compared with other

1225
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:12,210
churches I won't name for instance to be

1226
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:16,140
a saint in the Church of Emacs does not

1227
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:19,680
require celibacy but it does require

1228
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:23,550
living a life of moral purity you must

1229
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,530
exercise whatever evil proprietary

1230
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:28,920
operating systems have possessed

1231
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:31,920
computers under your control or set up

1232
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:38,430
for your regular use and then install a

1233
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:41,250
wholly free operating system and then

1234
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:43,800
use an install exclusively free software

1235
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:45,660
with and on the system if you make this

1236
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,180
vow and you live by it then you too will

1237
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:51,389
be a saint and you'll have the right to

1238
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:54,380
wear a halo if you can find one because

1239
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:54,380
they don't make them any

1240
01:14:56,210 --> 01:15:04,590
there is a traditional rivalry between

1241
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:06,150
Emax and the other text editor VI so

1242
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:08,280
people occasionally ask whether

1243
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:13,589
according to the church of emacs the use

1244
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:23,370
of VI is a sin it's true that VI VI VI

1245
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:25,470
is the editor of the beast but using a

1246
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:30,300
free implementation of the AI is not a

1247
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:33,960
sin it's a penance a few years ago I

1248
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:39,990
visited China and some VI users proposed

1249
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:44,300
to attack me I was shocked but

1250
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:44,300
apparently violence begins with VI

1251
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:53,700
people occasionally ask whether my halo

1252
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:57,300
is really an old computer disk this is

1253
01:15:53,700 --> 01:16:00,650
no computer disk this is my halo but it

1254
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:04,820
was a computer disk in a previous life

1255
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:04,820
so thank you

1256
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:20,920
now it's time for the auction

1257
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:49,180

1258
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:54,780

01:20:51,820 --> 01:21:05,860
intermediaries to save you from having

1312
01:20:54,020 --> 01:21:08,570
to move I can't hear you

1313
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:11,179
okay to pay with a credit card you

1314
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:14,920
should write all of the card data on a

1315
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:17,960
piece of paper and then bring them both

1316
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:20,180
we don't have that computer to handle

1317
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:28,340
card transactions we put it in as a

1318
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:33,130
phone purchase but it works so at this

1319
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:33,130
point I can answer some questions

1320
01:21:40,499 --> 01:21:46,228
I still have hearing problems if you

1321
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:53,570
don't speak loud I can't tell you said

1322
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:57,449
anything well ah got it

1323
01:21:53,570 --> 01:22:01,590
excellent your idea of legislation is a

1324
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:04,558
really great idea I've already written a

1325
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:08,659
plan for legislation and have it in the

1326
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:11,699
form of a bill sitting on my website

1327
01:22:08,659 --> 01:22:16,530
anybody here is welcome to go out to my

1328
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:19,018
blog and download the bill modify it in

1329
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:21,420
any way email it back and I'll put it

1330
01:22:19,019 --> 01:22:24,749
back on the blog I'm sure that it's not

1331
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:28,199
right I really like to do this could you

1332
01:22:24,749 --> 01:22:30,690
email me I would be happy to I don't

1333
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:35,940
have your email address you don't I

1334
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:38,308
thought everyone did its RMS Ed Gein org

1335
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:42,719
I thought everyone knew that cool I will

1336
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:45,809
do that my website is Trip elix and I

1337
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:49,050
write is that I fight the data brokers

1338
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:51,749
and I know who the data brokers are when

1339
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:54,179
you talk about the vehicle things that

1340
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:57,030
are being recorded they're all available

1341
01:22:54,179 --> 01:23:00,719
from TransUnion anybody can buy where

1342
01:22:57,030 --> 01:23:04,590
you go for 12 bucks if you want to know

1343
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:07,650
where what is collected about all of you

1344
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:11,760
you can go out to list dot next mark

1345
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:24,780
calm and that is the directory of all of

1346
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:28,940
the sites trip t RI p l IX dot-com

1347
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:31,550
keep up the good work please mr. Gazoo

1348
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:34,830
[Applause]

1349
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:38,730
so you're talking about the license

1350
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:40,440
plate readers in New Jersey the Attorney

1351
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:43,259
General in 2015

1352
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,910
changed the rules for how long this data

1353
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:48,090
from the license plate readers needed to

1354
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:51,090
be kept it it currently needs to be kept

1355
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:53,400
for five years any time they obtain any

1356
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:56,250
of the license plate data it's kept five

1357
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,759
years and they said you know what maybe

1358
01:23:56,250 --> 01:24:02,480
that's too long so you know if after two

1359
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:06,410
years you don't want to keep it anymore

1360
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:09,209
you can pass it to the State Police and

1361
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:11,700
then if you get them to hold on to it

1362
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,800
for the next three we'll get we'll let

1363
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,139
you off the hawk but you must keep it at

1364
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,180
least two then you can pass it to the

1365
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:19,950
State Police so that's the current

1366
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:22,160
Attorney General guidance you can just

1367
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:24,900
find just by googling that regulation

1368
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:28,260
and then you know it's really funny

1369
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:29,790
because there's a story in Seattle one

1370
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:31,980
of the town council members was very

1371
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:35,160
upset when they were testing license

1372
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:36,690
plate readers because they noticed that

1373
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:39,450
you know you could the public was gonna

1374
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:41,700
have access to this data and they could

1375
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:44,910
see that the town council member was at

1376
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,870
his girlfriend's house and then all of a

1377
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:48,030
sudden they said well you know maybe

1378
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:51,059
it's not such a good idea to make this

1379
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:54,599
data available for everyone so thanks

1380
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:56,400
well I agree it's bad to make it it's

1381
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,510
even worse to make it available to

1382
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:03,660
everybody basically I don't think that

1383
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:07,200
allowing everyone to watch everyone

1384
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:08,820
makes it safe to have surveillance yeah

1385
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,950
and what's really interesting is it's

1386
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:14,370
all about policing for profit in many

1387
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:16,139
cases you know when your car expires the

1388
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:17,880
registration expires they don't just

1389
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:19,770
send you a renewal notice again to say

1390
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,630
hey you missed the renewal what they do

1391
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:23,400
is they put police cars especially in

1392
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:25,460
New Jersey I know for a fact they put

1393
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,839
police cars right outside on the road

1394
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:29,310
monitoring every car that goes by and as

1395
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,370
soon as it triggers an expired

1396
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:34,410
registration by the LPL lookup they just

1397
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:36,990
that guy just radios to another car to

1398
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:39,090
stop that vehicle and give that person a

1399
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:41,400
ticket so it's just about using these

1400
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,450
records to just quickly generate more

1401
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,190
revenue rather than just

1402
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,389
another billing notice so it's it's

1403
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:50,190
really interesting how this data is

1404
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:59,310
being used already and then retain for

1405
01:25:50,190 --> 01:26:01,860
five years for everybody sorry I can't

1406
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:04,500
hear you at all you're speaking very

1407
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:06,540
quietly a Jew doesn't work vigilant data

1408
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:11,660
has that data forever that's what the

1409
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:11,660
cops use it's all one system in Virginia

1410
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:23,700
I a huge fan I've got another license

1411
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:26,340
plate question earlier you had said it's

1412
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:28,230
acceptable for automated license plate

1413
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:30,630
reader to use a database of known bad

1414
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:32,700
license plates would you say that

1415
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:35,520
license plates themselves or just before

1416
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:38,849
even without computers or just a form of

1417
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,620
tracking well they are but novel I

1418
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,850
personally have a problem with license

1419
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,450
plates where I'm just curious through

1420
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:45,870
your take

1421
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:50,820
they are obviously a system specifically

1422
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:53,849
for tracking but the question is how

1423
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:57,210
much traffic tracking do we need this

1424
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:59,880
the IE I never thought about the

1425
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:02,690
question of should cars have to display

1426
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,690
a license plate

1427
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:09,839
there are arguments in favor that are

1428
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:13,910
pretty obvious and yet they do make it

1429
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:17,490
possible to track people but in the past

1430
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:22,769
the amount of tracking that was feasible

1431
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:26,790
to do was rather limited there was no

1432
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:29,250
thought forty years ago of trying to see

1433
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:31,710
every license plate that goes anywhere

1434
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:40,040
it would have been ridiculously

1435
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:40,040
unfeasible alright thank you

1436
01:27:51,510 --> 01:28:01,830
well if there are no more questions we

1437
01:27:55,140 --> 01:28:05,070
can declare this over I'd like to

1438
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:08,210
mention though that the free software

1439
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:11,759
movement needs lots of work and

1440
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:14,460
assistance from you if you look at

1441
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,570
ganoub dot org slash help you can see a

1442
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:20,430
list of the kinds of work we need and

1443
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:22,860
some of the work is programming but

1444
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:26,550
there are a lot of other kinds of work

1445
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:28,559
don't think that if you're not good

1446
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:30,630
enough to write big programs that you

1447
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,030
can't help us you can help us with

1448
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:35,220
something that's not programming there

1449
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:38,219
are many kinds of non programming work

1450
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:42,150
we need and you know dot org slash help

1451
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:44,790
lists them you can also join the Free

1452
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:47,219
Software Foundation you can do that

1453
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:52,470
right here I have cards you can fill out

1454
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:55,290
you can pay your dues in cash or you can

1455
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:58,560
join through fsf.org but then you'd have

1456
01:28:55,290 --> 01:29:02,970
to pay digitally by the way one thing we

1457
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:07,410
need to do is set up anonymous payments

1458
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:08,040
for e-commerce I don't buy things on the

1459
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:11,790
Internet

1460
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:16,170
I just won't because I buy things in a

1461
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:18,840
physical store and I pay cash if I used

1462
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:23,930
a bank card they would know who is

1463
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:28,470
buying what and that is surveillance so

1464
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:31,680
we shouldn't stand for that we have a

1465
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:36,239
system called good new taller look at

1466
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:39,600
power net for anonymous digital payments

1467
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:41,969
it's not a currency it's just a payment

1468
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:45,180
system the payments are denominated in

1469
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:50,610
and some other currency like it could be

1470
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:54,540
US dollars all right and it's anonymous

1471
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:55,440
for the payer but it's not anonymous for

1472
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,810
the payee

1473
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:02,460
so the amount all the payments that a

1474
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:03,870
store gets are recorded silvus cannot be

1475
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:10,380
used to

1476
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:18,630
taxes but it does give anonymity to the

1477
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:20,190
purchaser for digital purchases that is

1478
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:22,770
if what you want if your what you're

1479
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:25,280
buying is a download or some service of

1480
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:29,900
some sort that's all you need for

1481
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:32,519
anonymity for buying physical goods

1482
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:35,070
there's one other thing needed which is

1483
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:40,620
an anonymous way to deliver the product

1484
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:44,549
of the purchaser but essentially society

1485
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:46,860
is moving in that direction Amazon I

1486
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:50,310
believe has set up a lot of delivery

1487
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:53,219
boxes in places where products can be

1488
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:56,100
delivered if that were split off from

1489
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:59,330
Amazon and made into some independent

1490
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:03,620
thing that any company could deliver to

1491
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:03,620
then that would be everything you need

1492
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:22,980
Thank You about the chief information

1493
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:25,800
officer appointed in this administration

1494
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:29,790
they were a previous board member at

1495
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:33,480
Ernst & Young like banks and they also

1496
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:36,110
have ties to virtualized systems like

1497
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,790
better proprietary and like you know I

1498
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:40,889
have no idea who you're talking about or

1499
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:43,800
if it's one person or multiple people on

1500
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:45,570
it I'm just stating what's transpired in

1501
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:48,170
this administration so I'm curious to

1502
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:50,429
know your thoughts on virtualization

1503
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:54,270
corporations such as VMware and the

1504
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:57,660
dangers that they are well VMware makes

1505
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:59,670
proprietary software right yes well

1506
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:02,400
that's evil yes and now that the

1507
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:07,560
legislation yeah I'm not a disagree the

1508
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:11,120
legislation now that's being proposed is

1509
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:15,330
to put all of the government systems

1510
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:17,739
into the cloud there is no cloud no

1511
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:20,140
cloud please please don't use that

1512
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:23,139
it's only those computers I know right

1513
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:26,350
the point is every time you speak as if

1514
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:28,030
there were a cloud you're helping to

1515
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:30,670
confuse people

1516
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:32,679
that is a marketing buzzword for the

1517
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:35,680
purpose of confusing and misleading

1518
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:39,280
people people are supposed to think that

1519
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:42,460
the cloud is a place and that because

1520
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:46,389
it's all so fuzzy you don't need to ask

1521
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:48,700
where is it really so if someone

1522
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:51,940
proposes to keep data on a server that

1523
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:55,269
rate should raise questions whose server

1524
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:59,559
we're what things will that server do

1525
01:32:55,270 --> 01:33:02,880
with my data what country is it in what

1526
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:05,200
laws does it operate under and if

1527
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,420
various different computers will be

1528
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,120
involved that I want to know the answer

1529
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:13,870
for each one of them you end up finding

1530
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:16,330
out with it with we're the answer you

1531
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:18,460
would need is very complicated that's

1532
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:20,260
because it's being done in a bad way if

1533
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,739
you did that processing in your own

1534
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:25,750
computer then if it's if the software is

1535
01:33:23,739 --> 01:33:30,459
free you'd have control over it so

1536
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:33,219
systems such as Einstein used in ICT

1537
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:35,920
technology systems are I never heard of

1538
01:33:33,219 --> 01:33:37,600
it yes I know they're something you

1539
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,880
really got to look deep down inside and

1540
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:42,219
see what they're taking now current

1541
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:44,380
infrastructure and putting it forward so

1542
01:33:42,219 --> 01:33:46,450
I just wanted to I'm afraid you're

1543
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:48,760
bringing up an area where I'm not an

1544
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:50,559
expert and I know nothing I agree we

1545
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,560
need to raise these questions that you

1546
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,420
just what I'm saying is though the

1547
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:58,450
government I say that the government

1548
01:33:55,420 --> 01:34:03,250
should always fully maintain control

1549
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:05,739
over its own computing it's an abuse for

1550
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:08,469
the government to run a non-free program

1551
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:11,110
because that means the government loses

1552
01:34:08,469 --> 01:34:14,680
control of the computing it's doing for

1553
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:16,780
us its responsibility to the people is

1554
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:19,840
to maintain full control over the

1555
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:23,860
computing it does and not hand that

1556
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:26,050
control over to any private hands so the

1557
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:27,940
government should never use a non-free

1558
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:31,000
program and it should

1559
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:36,460
never entrust its computing to a private

1560
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:38,590
server no matter who they are doesn't

1561
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:41,050
matter we don't even have to ask who

1562
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:44,800
owns the proprietary program or who owns

1563
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:47,620
the server it's fundamentally wrong so

1564
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,989
instead of getting distracted by all the

1565
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:51,910
details of those questions we should

1566
01:34:49,989 --> 01:34:53,500
insist that the government do things in

1567
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:57,910
such a way that those questions don't

1568
01:34:53,500 --> 01:35:03,000
arise at all take a look at ganoub org

1569
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:06,190
slash government for more about this I

1570
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,250
have a question I was wondering if you'd

1571
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:10,900
be willing to share an opinion about the

1572
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:13,510
use of some of the technology you talked

1573
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:17,469
about today like location services on I

1574
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:19,810
moss of devices that are used for non

1575
01:35:17,469 --> 01:35:22,719
spying purposes like when someone that's

1576
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:25,660
been abducted or is going to be hurt is

1577
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:26,949
ended up becoming saved by law

1578
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:29,559
enforcement or something like that well

1579
01:35:26,949 --> 01:35:32,620
I'm not against telling somebody where

1580
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:34,930
you are sometimes I'm not saying you

1581
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:37,690
shouldn't ever be allowed to tell people

1582
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:43,120
I'm saying systems shouldn't be designed

1583
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:46,000
to track you with you want help and you

1584
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,910
push some button that says help me well

1585
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,360
then it's perfectly fine to if it tells

1586
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:54,460
someone where you are but what about the

1587
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:57,429
times one it happens automatically as a

1588
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:59,460
result of the surveillance I have no

1589
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:03,840
idea you see I don't have those devices

1590
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:06,040
never happens to me thank you

1591
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,870
hello mr. Stallman first thing I like to

1592
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:10,180
say thank you for being the moral fiber

1593
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:12,190
holding together the technology industry

1594
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,890
and pushing a sport into a more open

1595
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:17,799
future for every why don't want an open

1596
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:21,190
future I want a freedom respecting

1597
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:25,300
future remember open-source is the

1598
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:25,870
slogan for rejecting our values thank

1599
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,870
you

1600
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:31,300
my question is oriented around ISPs and

1601
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:33,070
routing middleman's such as a CloudFlare

1602
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:35,080
who are developing and deploying open

1603
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:37,420
source technologies probably I really

1604
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:39,550
wish you I can't converse with you about

1605
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:40,350
open source because I'd be endorsing

1606
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:42,150
value

1607
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:45,380
that disagree with mine sorry free

1608
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:51,179
technologies but what is your opinion on

1609
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:53,940
the part of the offloading of traffic to

1610
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:58,080
these edge based providers and breaking

1611
01:36:53,940 --> 01:37:00,690
protocols such as BGP and proper okay I

1612
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:04,650
don't know about those I'm not I'm not

1613
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:07,530
an internet Wizards I've heard of BGP

1614
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:10,410
and that's all I have nothing to do with

1615
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:12,750
it now there's an FSF sysadmin who was

1616
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:17,420
here and may still be here and i think

1617
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:22,260
he knows something about BGP but I don't

1618
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:24,600
my opinion of CloudFlare is that it

1619
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:27,300
blocks me from getting to sites because

1620
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:30,660
it sends me a CAPTCHA that I can't

1621
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:33,390
answer because it depends on non-free

1622
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:36,510
javascript code or some in some other

1623
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:39,990
way fails to work now I'm not

1624
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:42,030
necessarily against CAPTCHAs but I wish

1625
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:44,219
they would do the capture in a way that

1626
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:46,620
works for people like me that are coming

1627
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:49,440
in through tor and won't run a non-free

1628
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:52,260
program thank you for your time in your

1629
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:56,160
words now that whether there's a deeper

1630
01:37:52,260 --> 01:38:04,380
problem or issue with CloudFlare I don't

1631
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:07,320
know I haven't heard of one hi Richard I

1632
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:10,710
just wanted to thank you for for you

1633
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:12,660
help 500 days ago at the last hope we

1634
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:15,900
created the privacy board here in New

1635
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:18,690
York I reach out to you by email and you

1636
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:20,670
send me truly a rules that I should

1637
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:24,269
follow when I put this thing together

1638
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:26,130
and I wanted to share them with you

1639
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:28,470
because I didn't see them on your slide

1640
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:31,050
but I discovered that those treat layer

1641
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:35,340
rule for every politician I met in New

1642
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:38,790
York it was a light bulb which I I can't

1643
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:42,660
wreck it three what rules three layers

1644
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:45,030
no rules I'm French so this is not

1645
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:50,940
perfect how you say that in English

1646
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:53,940
of course a cast of wood idea rules are

1647
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:54,360
you how you call that rules oh yeah but

1648
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,638
you said

1649
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:59,580
I heard a word before that it sounded

1650
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:06,179
like three-layer no you gave me three

1651
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:08,489
three dois wait Tuareg let me see so you

1652
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,440
gave me those three rules and I didn't

1653
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:14,070
see them on your slide and I think for

1654
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:16,559
politician when I met them I them those

1655
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:18,570
three rule and they all had the light

1656
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,790
bomb in their head which will end them

1657
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:25,019
back to me or read them to you

1658
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:27,830
well Adam data that must be collected

1659
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:32,310
for some important civic reason and

1660
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:34,050
should be published is in terms of the

1661
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:35,550
collection of data so data that must be

1662
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:38,280
collected for some important Civic

1663
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:40,500
region and should be published the

1664
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:42,449
second rule you gave me was data that

1665
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:44,850
must be collected for some important

1666
01:39:42,449 --> 01:39:47,519
civic reason but should not be published

1667
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:50,969
and the third one was data that should

1668
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,940
not be collected at all those were three

1669
01:39:50,969 --> 01:39:57,869
ruled that every politician could start

1670
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:59,610
a conversation from anywhere and I think

1671
01:39:57,869 --> 01:40:01,589
you should put them out there on your

1672
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,780
slide when you talk about the politics

1673
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:06,869
but thank you very much for the help

1674
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:09,780
thank you but the slides that I have are

1675
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:13,110
for free software talks that's why I

1676
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:15,500
used them only for a while and then when

1677
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:19,290
I started speaking about surveillance

1678
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:23,670
specifically I didn't have slides I

1679
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:25,590
can't draw I can't draw my own slides I

1680
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:28,650
have to talk with an artist to get them

1681
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:30,780
drawn and I've been focusing on covering

1682
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:37,320
the whole of the free software topic

1683
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:45,110
with slides are you announce that please

1684
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:45,110
cuz yeah okay dr. Sahlman

1685
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:57,450
and more questions it looks like there

1686
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:59,269
no more

1687
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:01,280
well telly I'll tell you what we have

1688
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:04,370
possibility anyway and it's really up to

1689
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:07,259
Richard how long he wants to say we have

1690
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:09,059
in the nez room which is just up the

1691
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:10,770
hallway here we've reserved that for up

1692
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:12,210
to two hours and I don't think we're

1693
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:13,800
expecting that you'll spend that much

1694
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:17,040
time but if people would like to have

1695
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:20,160
some small group discussion with with

1696
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,610
our guests we can facilitate that very

1697
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,889
easily

1698
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:24,389
I think he's his Constitution appears to

1699
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:26,370
be up for it that was a question how

1700
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:27,870
long do you oughta stick around right

1701
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:28,980
but I think he's willing to spend a

1702
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:31,230
little bit time and so what we would

1703
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:32,910
probably do is just take a you know like

1704
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:34,830
a five or ten minute bio break and then

1705
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:36,480
convene there right around the top of

1706
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:43,200
the next hour it's out of interests to

1707
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:44,429
some people in the room okay yeah it's

1708
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,679
in those room and it's just I think

1709
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:49,140
people have seen it it's almost opposite

1710
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:50,580
the bathrooms up the hallway here okay

1711
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:55,530
so uh do you have any closing remarks

1712
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:56,880
you're good it's gone I think I think

1713
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:58,380
we're done so like I said there's

1714
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,090
actually another talk in the nez room

1715
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,650
right now so we'll have to give them a

1716
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:03,390
few minutes Richard do you hear me

1717
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:05,040
there's another talk that's ending at

1718
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:06,900
the top of the hour so we'll uh we'll

1719
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,660
convene there in a few moments and he

1720
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:11,940
sees on site also afterwards free

1721
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:14,099
software foundation I think if again if

1722
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:16,740
Richards Constitution holds he'll be

1723
