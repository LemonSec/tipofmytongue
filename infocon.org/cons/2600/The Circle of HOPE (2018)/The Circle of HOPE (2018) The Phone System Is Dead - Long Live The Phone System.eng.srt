1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,290
very good to be here again in New York

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,330
and I'm kind of surprised so many people

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,280
showed up for a telecom talk I expected

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,639
like three people all of whom would be

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,518
my friends so as you know I've been

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,250
writing for 2600 for quite some time and

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,960
telecoms my hobby there were actually

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,240
people that know quite a bit more than

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,859
me and so I do draw on their work when I

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,580
write the telecom Informer but you know

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,689
I've been doing it a while and and seen

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,849
development over a relatively long

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,610
period of time and that's something that

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,260
I think gives me a perspective being in

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,540
the technology industry and having

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,010
followed telecom where I can see some

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,649
patterns that are repeating and so

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,079
that's what I'd like to talk to you guys

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,690
about today and you know maybe share

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,510
some ideas for how the phone system can

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,059
evolve from where we are today

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,699
so I first of all just kind of wanted to

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,578
give a retrospective of hope you know

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,410
we've been here a really long time you

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,439
know coming together every two years and

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,200
every two years there's evolution that

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:11,880
happens around telecommunications we've

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:16,049
been you know examining these issues at

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,240
hope for probably longer than anyone in

30
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,189
the conference circuit and there's

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,048
something that I wanted to address this

32
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,429
year because it's really come up a lot

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,350
on Twitter and some of the other

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,619
following forums that I follow and

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,640
that's the political nature of hope we

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,680
are unabashedly political here and

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,450
particularly when it comes to telecom if

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,270
you look at the telecom talks there

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,420
there is a lot of public policy in them

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,880
and if you review past talks at hope

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,270
that's been the case going back for you

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,810
know over a decade now why is that the

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,470
reason is that it's very difficult to

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,100
separate the technology itself from how

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,890
we use it as humans and how we organize

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,949
ourselves as humans is generally through

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,840
our governments so when we talk about

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,910
hope being political I think that it's

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,310
just really difficult a lot of the time

50
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,880
to separate the technology from you know

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,240
the users

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,190
so please do have an open mind you know

53
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,860
when it comes to politics and technology

54
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,890
it's you know with telecom I'll kind of

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,770
demonstrate in this talk why public

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,899
policy is so important and how much of a

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,930
cornerstone that is in how we all

58
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,700
communicate today so what's the story of

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,640
telecommunications its fragmentation and

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,280
unity and what do I mean by that at the

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,609
dawn of the telecommunications era there

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:51,280
was no universal phone system there was

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:53,380
no ability for one person in one town to

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,110
call somebody else in a different town

65
00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:00,480
and none of that happened by accident

66
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:05,170
that was all deliberate so as

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,899
fragmentation became unity we're now

68
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,790
starting to see fragmentation again and

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,650
I'll get to that toward the end of the

70
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,989
talk but I just want to set this theme

71
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,060
upfront that in telecom there's a lot of

72
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,040
history that's repeating itself we've

73
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,440
had a story of fragmentation at the

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,570
beginning we had unity kind of in the

75
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,520
middle of the telecommunications era and

76
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,519
now we're back to fragmentation again

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,250
what we get to unity again it's hard to

78
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,770
say there are proposals to do that the

79
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,710
last speaker had some had some things to

80
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,600
say in that space I don't know what the

81
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,730
answer is because a lot of that comes

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
down again to politics and public policy

83
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:47,019
and what we decide as a society we're

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,330
going to do with telecom so this is a

85
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,420
timeline about the early days of telecom

86
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,870
and I I kind of want to set the stage by

87
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,880
just grounding us all with a common set

88
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,010
of knowledge around the pace of

89
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,579
innovation and you know what does that

90
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,530
mean usually when there's a new

91
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,690
technology you see a lot of rapid

92
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,790
iteration around that around that

93
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,890
technology right there's you know when

94
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,560
we started to have internet access in

95
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,599
the al Lyra there were all sorts of

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
applications that people built on top of

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,510
that and then over time things become

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,100
relatively stagnant if you look at the

99
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,420
state of the internet today and what you

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,280
can do with it

101
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,140
it isn't fundamentally a whole lot

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,669
different than it was five years ago

103
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,289
when you look at the types of

104
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,210
applications that we're using and the

105
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,190
things that we're doing on it certainly

106
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,070
some of the things that are happening on

107
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:42,190
the internet like you know our last

108
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,110
presidential election that's new the way

109
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,880
that people are using networks is new

110
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,000
but the technology hasn't really changed

111
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,100
an awful lot in the last five years we

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,440
have faster connections sometimes we

113
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,050
have new and and more creative will ways

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,840
to bill for the same thing but we don't

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,730
really you know have a whole lot of just

116
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,310
fundamentally new stuff like the latest

117
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:07,120
iPhone isn't a whole lot different than

118
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,100
the previous one but in the early days

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,230
of the Internet in the early days of

120
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,610
telecom there was a really rapid pace of

121
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,400
innovation and take a look at this

122
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,580
timeline in 1876 that's when the

123
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,219
telephone was invented right

124
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,280
fast-forward to you know the 1880s which

125
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,740
is less than ten years later and we have

126
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,320
long-distance calls you know so they so

127
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,230
not only is the whole phone system set

128
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,060
up so that you can actually call through

129
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,790
an exchange rather than having hard

130
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,950
lines between two places and you have a

131
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,440
phone number which people can reach you

132
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,539
on versus a name but you know you can

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,820
call people in another town that's just

134
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,580
leaps and bounds above the telephone

135
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,060
being invented a few years before right

136
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,789
you know 1891 you know maybe ten years

137
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,530
later automated switches so you don't

138
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,510
have operators plugging cord boards

139
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,630
anymore you actually have a you know a

140
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,969
very rudimentary automated mechanical

141
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,390
based switch being able to make those

142
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,840
connections for you and you know 1900 of

143
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,700
course all of us here at a 2600

144
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,560
conference are gonna have a soft spot

145
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,340
for payphones and and that's when the

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,730
first one was invented but by 1907 the

147
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,390
CEO of AT&T is talking about the concept

148
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:31,960
of universal service one policy one

149
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:33,849
system universal service so rewinding a

150
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,799
little bit I want to talk a bit more

151
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,900
about the fragmented infrastructure

152
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,280
because it's very difficult for us today

153
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,539
to even imagine

154
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,280
except it isn't because how many people

155
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,340
and I won't be able to see you when you

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,520
raise your hands use messaging apps like

157
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,599
signal or kik or snapchat or something

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,099
like that what I'm guessing is that

159
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,860
pretty much everybody in the room raised

160
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,260
their hand and there's a commonality a

161
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,700
common thread with these apps if you're

162
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,639
in one of them you can't communicate

163
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,270
with people in a different app well it

164
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,760
was exactly the same at the time of the

165
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,469
you know the early telephone system if

166
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,539
you had a phone from Bell from AT&T you

167
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,340
actually weren't able to call somebody

168
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,750
with the phone from an independent phone

169
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,270
company and there were there could be

170
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,790
two three sometimes four or more phone

171
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,219
companies per city New York had quite a

172
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,130
few all these companies were

173
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,630
incompatible with the other ones so bit

174
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,060
what businesses would do is they'd

175
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,979
subscribe to multiple phones from

176
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,960
different companies so all of the

177
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,450
potential customers who had different

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,530
phone companies could call them you know

179
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,419
by 1912 rural exchanges began to be a

180
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,030
thing and so these farmer cooperatives

181
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,640
would you know go string some line and

182
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,080
put in a switch and you know not there

183
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,550
wouldn't be anybody to really take care

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,130
of it and they wouldn't be connected to

185
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,690
anybody else necessarily but you'd be

186
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,969
able to call from one farm to another

187
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,830
down the road and so you know that that

188
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,550
met the needs of the local communities

189
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,680
by 1927 you know there were six thousand

190
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,990
at these things and a lot of them were

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,190
falling into disrepair there just wasn't

192
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,729
enough money coming in from

193
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,080
subscriptions to maintain the network

194
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,479
they weren't always interconnected and

195
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,940
and that was also another really big

196
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:32,110
problem

197
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:34,750
so around 1907 you know Bell's customers

198
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,159
18 teased customers started complaining

199
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,539
that you know it was a little bit

200
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,490
ridiculous that they couldn't call

201
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,069
people who had a different phone company

202
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,890
and this begun to be a competitive issue

203
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,830
for AT&T which by then was by far the

204
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,380
dominant player in telecom and so

205
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,470
Theodore Vail you know this guy was like

206
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:58,560
one of the

207
00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:01,020
you know early 1900s industrial you know

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,510
industrial grates right he he was into

209
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,150
mergers and acquisitions and so what he

210
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,010
started doing is got a whole bunch of

211
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,760
money together by partnering with JP

212
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,560
Morgan and started buying up every

213
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,420
independent phone company that they

214
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,609
could get their hands on and then they

215
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,490
also bought the Western Union Telegraph

216
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,790
Company which consolidated a massive

217
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:30,800
amount of power market power inside of

218
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:34,589
one company so you know this actually

219
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,959
was the first step toward AT&T becoming

220
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,590
a monopoly right and they were fully

221
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,180
vertically integrated monopoly they had

222
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,430
Western Electric which was the

223
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:49,890
manufacturer of telephone switches and

224
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:51,810
telephone equipment they 1907 I actually

225
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,600
have a typo on the slide they acquired

226
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,770
Western Union which was the you know the

227
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,460
primary method of of long-distance

228
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,990
communication at the time was

229
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,560
telegraphed so they bought the Western

230
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,900
Union Telegraph Company it you know 1908

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,609
to 1913 as I mentioned they just went on

232
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,130
a buying spree and they acquired you

233
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,010
know dozens and dozens and dozens of

234
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,910
independent phone companies and then you

235
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:22,650
know finally this this thing became

236
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:25,829
pretty much a monopoly so Along Came the

237
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,720
Wilson administration's trust busters so

238
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,850
there was a problem actually you know in

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,860
the early 1900's it wasn't just telecom

240
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,230
that was the you know a consolidated

241
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,290
industry railroads were also a

242
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,330
consolidated in a consolidated industry

243
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,839
with a lot of market power and very few

244
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:46,080
players and the Wilson administration

245
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,450
was very active in filing antitrust

246
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,910
actions so what's an antitrust action

247
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,490
this actually happened against a company

248
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,530
I used to work for Microsoft I you know

249
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,950
the government will declare your company

250
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:02,490
a monopoly and when they do that they

251
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:05,370
will seek to break it up or require you

252
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,089
to spin out some assets you know in

253
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,170
order to

254
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:12,660
ooh foster competition in the industry

255
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,389
so how did it work out for Microsoft

256
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,579
they were able to pretty much keep

257
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:20,249
everything that they were doing but

258
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,529
operate under a consent decree by

259
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:25,529
opening up the office file format so

260
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:28,740
anybody could work in it so people that

261
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:32,459
follow antitrust kind of saw Microsoft

262
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:36,720
as the winner there and you know this is

263
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,609
out this was also the case with AT&T the

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,490
trust Buster's came in and and their

265
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,680
initial goal was to break up AT&T and

266
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:48,329
and require some degree of competition

267
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,089
what that turned into by a 19-13 was

268
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:53,040
what we called the Kingsbury commitment

269
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,569
and it's it's named after a vice

270
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,540
president at AT&T

271
00:11:54,569 --> 00:12:01,079
who negotiated this with the government

272
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,779
so what happened was AT&T committed to

273
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:08,550
interconnect with other carriers and

274
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:10,199
they agreed to do that by 1913 however

275
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,329
they weren't really giving up much

276
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,359
because that's what their customers

277
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,109
wanted they'd had demand for this for a

278
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,199
long time

279
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,120
in 1907 they'd come up with the idea of

280
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,449
universal service and of course what

281
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,269
they meant by that was not necessarily

282
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:29,819
interconnecting with other carriers

283
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,600
maybe the idea that they had in mind

284
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,729
more was to just buy them but then that

285
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,660
result is the same

286
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,220
the idea of one system universals

287
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,709
universality being able to call from one

288
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,439
phone to another phone and being able to

289
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,329
do that everywhere this is something

290
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:50,969
that AT&T agreed to do in the Kingsbury

291
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:54,209
commitment they also agreed to spin-off

292
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,309
Western Union however by then Western

293
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:59,939
Union was a lot less popular you know

294
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:01,769
Telegraph's are kind of a slow method of

295
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,439
communicating the cost of long distance

296
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,240
calling had come down a lot so people

297
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,219
were tending to pick up the phone and

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,509
make a call instead of sending a

299
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:16,470
telegram so this really didn't hurt AT&T

300
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:20,660
much either so how do I see this I see

301
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:24,570
that as a win for a team

302
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,180
18 18 - 18 19 I think is a really

303
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,900
interesting historical footnote so this

304
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,459
was the first time that the government

305
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,920
acknowledged that 1880 was a monopoly

306
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,590
and that they had a huge amount of power

307
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,560
over American communications because in

308
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,840
World War one they nationalized AT&T

309
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,189
they took the whole company over for a

310
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,930
year they weren't they were concerned

311
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,480
about the security of the communications

312
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,949
infrastructure so the army just went in

313
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,050
and ran the company for a year the

314
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,980
government actually paid 18t a ten

315
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,560
percent rate of return you know as as

316
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:02,220
compensation for doing this but it was

317
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,770
the first formal recognition of 18 t's

318
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,360
monopoly over communications in the

319
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:11,640
United States so fast forward a couple

320
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:21,090
of years - the Communications Act of

321
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:25,280
1934 the Communications Act of 1934 this

322
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:27,990
is a law that actually codified 18t

323
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,540
effectively is a monopoly now if you're

324
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,550
googling furiously in the background and

325
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,800
finding policy papers from the cato

326
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,040
institute and other conservative writers

327
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,050
there is on the right side of the

328
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,819
political equation some disagreement

329
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,939
over whether the Communications Act of

330
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,540
1934 really guaranteed universal service

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,270
and whether it really codified AT&T as a

332
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,689
monopoly what I look at is what the FCC

333
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:59,340
says about itself if you look at their

334
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:02,100
history page in the FCC's view this Act

335
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,800
gave them the power over AT&T to

336
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,500
regulated as a monopoly and also gave

337
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,859
them the power to require Universal

338
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,860
Service

339
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:19,360
so what are the Communications Act of

340
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:24,370
1934 deal it created the FCC who we all

341
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,399
know and love maybe it made phone

342
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,370
companies subject to FCC regulation and

343
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:34,060
that's a really huge move right so when

344
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,220
you create a federal agency and you put

345
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,599
an industry underneath the thumb of that

346
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,490
federal agency as a regulated industry

347
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,339
then it gives that agency a heck of a

348
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,880
lot of power how that agency interprets

349
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,079
the law the rules that it publishes are

350
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,730
basically your rules of the road as a

351
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,479
company and how you're going to be able

352
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,000
to operate so this was a very dramatic

353
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,820
change from how AT&T had operated before

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,600
they had direct federal regulation they

355
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,970
had to follow what the FCC said it

356
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,769
effectively designated phone companies

357
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,190
as common carriers and what's a common

358
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:14,230
carrier it means you know a railroad is

359
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,209
a common carrier when when you can when

360
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,160
they take boxes from pretty much anybody

361
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,979
and move them and have nothing to do

362
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,500
with what's in the boxes 18 T is a

363
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,000
common carrier because they don't have

364
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,630
anything to do with the content of the

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,240
communications they just actually carry

366
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,570
the communications and regulating a

367
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,540
business as a common carrier comes with

368
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,370
very specific requirements that you need

369
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,770
to meet for the government so for

370
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,360
example if you're a railroad and you're

371
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,160
carrying boxes that are full of

372
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,020
something the government believes to be

373
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,540
illegal the government has the right to

374
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,930
get a warrant and search those and it's

375
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,510
the same that became true with the phone

376
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,209
system until 1934 there was no federal

377
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,470
wiretap statute one of the first things

378
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,599
you know and I think this is really

379
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,100
funny one of the very first things that

380
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,079
the government did when they regulated

381
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,630
telecom was give themselves the ability

382
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:12,490
to spy on it and also give themselves

383
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:14,919
the ability to regulate how spying would

384
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,970
happen and how access was granted to the

385
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,610
network and you know the first federal

386
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,800
Universal Service law what is that well

387
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,990
what's the concept of Universal Service

388
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,319
is the idea that telecommunications like

389
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,449
Eli

390
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,759
tricity and running water are basic

391
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:33,700
services that are offered in the United

392
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,620
States we do have some disagreement

393
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,389
today over whether Universal service

394
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,739
when it comes to water is a thing we

395
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,129
should have if you look at Flint

396
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,610
Michigan that is not something that is

397
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,289
available everywhere safely you know

398
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:52,389
electricity the rural electrification

399
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:54,250
Act provided Universal Service and the

400
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:57,100
electricity and the idea being that

401
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:01,019
there are cross subsidies so even if

402
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,219
it's incredibly unprofitable to have

403
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,350
telecommunications or electric service

404
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,649
in a particular jurisdiction like on the

405
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,299
farm my dad grew up on I still that

406
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,860
service would be provided because that's

407
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:16,480
just a basic thing that we do in the

408
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,729
United States and it began to set up the

409
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,500
first infrastructure for funding through

410
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,090
cross subsidies and that's a really

411
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,039
important point you know the idea that

412
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,769
no matter where you are in the United

413
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:30,009
States you would be able to have a

414
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:33,070
telephone and if you were in you know

415
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:35,889
Stehekin Washington which is all the way

416
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,200
at the very top of you know Lake Chelan

417
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:40,110
you can only get there on a boat and

418
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,970
usually not every day during the winter

419
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,309
you'd have access to the same quality of

420
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:54,820
phone service as if you were in Seattle

421
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:58,809
or here in New York so 1934 to 1996 set

422
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,610
into motion a very closely regulated era

423
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,769
of telecommunications and many of us

424
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,418
grew up in this era where if you wanted

425
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:09,039
a phone you got it from bowel and if you

426
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,100
wanted a telephone service it would be

427
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,309
very consistent anywhere that you were

428
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:18,610
and the pricing was regulated by States

429
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,250
so through what's published called the

430
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,080
tariffs and these things still exist in

431
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,779
many states because actually a lot of

432
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,330
rates and regulations for landline

433
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:31,570
telephone service still carry with them

434
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,600
the same regulations as during the

435
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,700
regulated era before 1996 and I'll get

436
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,870
tonight 1996 and what happened then

437
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,500
later but during this regularly

438
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:46,350
the FCC categorized AT&T as a natural

439
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,620
monopoly and what does that mean it

440
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,658
meant that the government viewed telecom

441
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,789
as something that it didn't make any

442
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:57,090
sense to have a lot of competition in

443
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,679
just like they viewed electricity as

444
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,168
something that didn't make a whole lot

445
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,029
of sense to have competition in and so

446
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,460
what that meant is that the pace of

447
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,960
innovations slowed way down because 18t

448
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,909
didn't really have to do a whole lot

449
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,059
more than maintain their current

450
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:14,610
networks at the current level in order

451
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,559
to be able to collect a reliable

452
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,270
dividend for their investors right a

453
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,779
reliable rate of return for their

454
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:24,230
investors so when you're a monopoly the

455
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:27,380
government sets what your prices can be

456
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,450
they guarantee you a particular profit

457
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,000
but also you don't have to do much to

458
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,620
deliver new services that that's all a

459
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,429
very slow regulated process so along

460
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:43,770
with AT&T being categorized as a natural

461
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,779
monopoly the rural electrification Act

462
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,158
came along so why are we talking about

463
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,740
something about you know bringing

464
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,289
electricity to farms when we're talking

465
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,750
about AT&T it's because that same

466
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,610
framework that was set up to bringing

467
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,620
electricity to everywhere in the United

468
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,408
States is the framework that was used

469
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,899
for telecom across this era to guarantee

470
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:06,899
universal service to telecommunications

471
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,789
services the rural electrification act

472
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,850
first started with the electricity it

473
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,549
was later amended to telecom and so the

474
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,379
same access to low-interest loans were

475
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:18,480
available to farmer cooperatives for

476
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,149
example to upgrade their you know

477
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,610
rotting infrastructure from you know the

478
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,260
early 1900's to more modern phone

479
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,610
systems much of which happened in the

480
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:33,390
1960s and 70s telecom pricing and

481
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,809
quality were both regulated at a federal

482
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,470
and state level mostly at a state level

483
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:43,020
but you know using model legislation

484
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,520
generally speaking there wasn't a huge

485
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,799
amount of difference in pricing and

486
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,860
quality across states because you know

487
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,340
what what was being done was some

488
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,399
tweaking and pulling of knobs and levers

489
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,970
to be able to reach a guaranteed rate of

490
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,380
return that AT&T was allowed to make and

491
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,510
other phone companies were allowed to

492
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,010
make so there's only so many you know

493
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,990
tweaks that you can make to a

494
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,960
telecommunications billing landscape in

495
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,690
order to guarantee a consistent 10% of

496
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,700
rate rate of return for example and

497
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,860
there was a really slow pace of

498
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,940
innovation or relatively I would say so

499
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,250
yes

500
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:28,260
ss7 came along we did get digital

501
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:30,360
switching we got touch-tone we got 9-1-1

502
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,430
we even got direct dialed long-distance

503
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,379
but when you compare to the time line

504
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,400
that I showed earlier of how rapidly

505
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,670
things happen in the first 20 years of

506
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,800
telecommunications and the deployment of

507
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,600
new telecommunication systems you know

508
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,370
we're looking at a really long stretch

509
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,860
1934 to 1996 60 years roughly and not a

510
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,449
whole lot happened it was just a slow

511
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:59,669
steady business so this is Bill Clinton

512
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,460
and Al Gore and Bill Clinton signed this

513
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,250
legislation with a digital pen it's the

514
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,660
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and this

515
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,070
is the bane of the previous speakers

516
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:14,100
existence he does not like this and the

517
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:17,090
implementation thereof it was the first

518
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,290
major overhaul of telecom laws since

519
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,679
1934 and so the idea behind the

520
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:24,860
Telecommunications Act of 1996 was what

521
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,410
we were gonna do is shake up telecom

522
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:32,040
move it from this slow innovating stodgy

523
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:34,620
boring industry which was really kind of

524
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,360
behind the curve relative to other

525
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,010
countries and the development of the

526
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,040
internet and we were gonna make it

527
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,710
competitive and exciting and dynamic and

528
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,230
fast-moving and we were gonna do all of

529
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,480
this with one gargantuan piece of

530
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,230
legislation that was maybe ahead of the

531
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,880
technology it was regulating so what it

532
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,510
did was it open the phone system to

533
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,480
competition and by doing this it

534
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:05,370
required incumbent providers like you

535
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,480
know the the baby bells to open up to

536
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,550
interconnect

537
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,770
and sell wholesale services to

538
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,440
competitive local exchange carriers so

539
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:16,650
this is where your bandwidth comms came

540
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,670
into play they were able to lease space

541
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:24,710
inside for example a u.s. west central

542
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,990
office later quest later CenturyLink and

543
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,790
they were able to provide some of their

544
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,280
own services themselves they were able

545
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,260
to buy some services and private label

546
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,410
them from the incumbent local exchange

547
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,180
carrier and you know just the tariffs

548
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,250
for this were crazy I mean there was a

549
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,280
you know tariffs Reuters had a field day

550
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,980
with this it was it was work as far as

551
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,139
you could see being able to get the

552
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,660
regulatory infrastructure in place to be

553
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,250
able to do this it formalized a system

554
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,520
of access charges I've written a lot

555
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,090
about this in 2600 you know how there's

556
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,430
some arbitrage around access charges and

557
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,730
what an access charge is is it's money

558
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,380
that a local exchange carrier gets from

559
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,150
long distance carriers to complete a

560
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,340
call in their network and that's how you

561
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,810
get things like freeconferencecall.com

562
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,760
and and other things that are set up in

563
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,159
these high access charged jurisdictions

564
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,310
in order to stimulate a lot of inbound

565
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,170
traffic there's number portability so

566
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,669
you have the ability to take your phone

567
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,340
number and move it to another carrier

568
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,950
there wasn't actually you know really a

569
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,480
good way to do it at the time but you

570
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,410
know the law said that phone companies

571
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,660
had to there was voice over IP carrier

572
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,820
interconnection that was explicitly

573
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,960
allowed and this caused a whole lot of

574
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:46,760
problems later so in my view in 1996

575
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,650
you know the digital pen was exciting

576
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,770
but we went from steers of a very

577
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,540
closely regulated very close network to

578
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,330
opening up the whole thing practically

579
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,320
overnight and not all of the details

580
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:03,689
were really thought through so it may be

581
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,460
odd for me to be saying this right but

582
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,510
what the government does has

583
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,270
consequences

584
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,160
that's why hope is political because it

585
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,870
can impact technology and it can happen

586
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,300
both ways right you know we can get

587
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,580
ahead of where of how we decide as a

588
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,139
society to regulate things we're trying

589
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
to figure out now like what do we do

590
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,330
with social network

591
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,000
and the fact that they can influence

592
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,860
elections and have foreign influence in

593
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,720
them but the government can go the

594
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,659
opposite direction they can completely

595
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,090
change laws and force technological

596
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,690
change or allow technological change

597
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:39,059
that hasn't really been thought through

598
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,309
so remember ss7 I talked about that a

599
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,299
bit and I teased this in in the run-up

600
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,590
to this talk

601
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:49,260
well ss7 is a protocol that came about

602
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,610
not because the phone company wanted to

603
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,559
give you call waiting and touch-tone

604
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,149
dialing they would have been completely

605
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,299
happy to earn their 10 percent rate of

606
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,220
return consistently without doing that

607
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,780
what was threatened was actually that

608
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,970
they're guaranteed profits wouldn't be

609
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,289
there because nothing strikes fear into

610
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,059
the heart of a phone company like a

611
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,059
threat to billing and that picture there

612
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,730
is a threat to billing it's a blue box

613
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:14,309
and blue boxes came along they were a

614
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,900
way to exploit telecommunications and

615
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:17,908
for us infrastructure to make

616
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,890
long-distance calls for free and you

617
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:21,809
know we don't even think of of it

618
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,510
costing anything to communicate with

619
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:26,520
anyone anywhere in the world today but

620
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,260
you know at the time it was really

621
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,720
expensive if you wanted to call somebody

622
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,289
in the United Kingdom it cost more than

623
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,320
a dollar a minute to do it so that's why

624
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:39,570
this box existed that's actually what

625
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,730
2600 is named after is the tone that

626
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,039
seized a truck coming out of a blue box

627
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,830
a little piece of trivia that some of

628
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,110
you may or may not know and this was a

629
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,809
massive threat to billing the phone

630
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,610
company had to do something to stop new

631
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:57,570
boxing because it was threatening their

632
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:59,939
profits the 10% rate of return and it

633
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,189
was generally 10 percent wasn't

634
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,770
guaranteed that was just the most they

635
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,750
were allowed to earn but you know

636
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,510
long-distance calls were a big part of

637
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,179
that

638
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:14,700
so in ss7 you know this is a network

639
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:19,650
that was developed in 1975 for computers

640
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:22,350
that were contemporary in 1975 and we

641
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,919
have a very different attitude today of

642
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:28,139
what constitutes secure well in 1975 if

643
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,760
you were on the network that ran the

644
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,690
phone system you were inside a secure

645
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,460
facility

646
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,060
usually you had to go through to lock

647
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,210
doors

648
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,340
some places there was a guard there this

649
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,620
network was one that you just weren't on

650
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,709
unless you were inside of a phone

651
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,070
company physically and what they needed

652
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,290
to design this for was two things the

653
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,250
first was to be able to accurately do

654
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:55,830
billing outside of the outside of the

655
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,870
voiceband that people with blue boxes

656
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:01,620
had access to so it had to be a separate

657
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:04,199
network it had to run inside band and it

658
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,699
had to operate very quickly you know

659
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,170
there are some other features that the

660
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,540
phone companies thought they could sell

661
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,510
and you know things like caller ID and

662
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,540
and voicemail and call waiting and ss7

663
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,980
enabled these but in 1975

664
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,889
you know the computers that ran phone

665
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,260
switches weren't very powerful so the

666
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,390
idea of having authentication and

667
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,430
encryption wasn't something that they

668
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,310
could do with the performance that that

669
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,130
computing at the time allowed ss7 is

670
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,710
unauthenticated it's unencrypted it

671
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,900
trusts everything and so it's the

672
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:41,070
equivalent of if somebody shows up with

673
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:45,570
a bogus contract from nigeria having to

674
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:48,060
not only honor whatever access they want

675
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,580
to your network but also allow them to

676
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:54,649
claim that they're a bank and you know

677
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,649
that's the phone system today that's ss7

678
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,800
and that has led to robo calls this is

679
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,200
one Robo calling companies add and you

680
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,570
know there's how do robo calls work well

681
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,250
what I can do if I want a robo call

682
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:13,139
people is subscribe to a voice over IP

683
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:17,280
dialer platform what those dialer

684
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,720
platforms do is they will spoof whatever

685
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,879
a number you want to claim to come from

686
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,620
or however many hundreds of numbers you

687
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,350
claim that you want to come from on the

688
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,719
ss7 network how could how do they do

689
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:30,330
that it's because ss7 is trust by

690
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,250
default and these shady phone companies

691
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,280
have direct access to that network so

692
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:38,300
they can do pretty pretty much whoever

693
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,610
they want to be and it's very very cheap

694
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,260
using these tools because you know being

695
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,090
phone companies they interconnect with

696
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,629
other ones at very low rates

697
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:51,178
so this is kind of the crux of the

698
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:52,559
robocall problem you know the biggest

699
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,840
problem with robocalls

700
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,700
is not the fact that they're happening

701
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,350
it's the fact that they're really cheap

702
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,759
and it's the fact that it's impossible

703
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:04,769
to know who's actually calling you and

704
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,409
I'll talk a little bit about the

705
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:09,870
economics of robocalls here because I

706
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:13,019
think that they'll be really shocking to

707
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:16,439
most people so if you want to you know

708
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:19,259
get into a campaign robocalling people

709
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,119
you can call everyone in Seattle every

710
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,129
single person literally all of them in

711
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,869
around 28 minutes for around a hundred

712
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:27,209
and fifty dollars and that's using a

713
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:31,289
midsize dialer platform there are bigger

714
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,779
ones so the barrier to entry is very low

715
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,610
the cost is almost nothing you know and

716
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,779
that's the economics that we're up

717
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:44,820
against with the problem that opening up

718
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:46,200
access to ss7 has created so phone

719
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,658
companies are aware that this is a

720
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,029
problem but keep in mind what motivates

721
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,610
phone companies billing that's the

722
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:56,190
number one motivator so phone companies

723
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,309
don't really care so much that robo

724
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,990
calls are happening what they do care

725
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:02,730
for is that they can't build for them

726
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,279
and so when you look at the design of

727
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:08,399
the shaken and store architecture this

728
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,350
is something that really is being driven

729
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,840
by Billings so you know it's

730
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,549
conveniently also a way for larger phone

731
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,600
companies to lock out smaller ones

732
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:20,009
because by putting together a very heavy

733
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,498
authentication infrastructure where you

734
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,999
have to buy certificates in order to

735
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:26,249
authenticate calls between phone

736
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:31,830
companies and they're you know this

737
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:33,659
particular proposal has an unnamed set

738
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,668
of large phone companies that are

739
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,529
actually going to have signing authority

740
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:39,059
for smaller ones so if you're a smaller

741
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,679
phone company you'll have to go through

742
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,408
a bigger phone company and pay them to

743
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,350
get access to the network you know this

744
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:49,740
really isn't something that I think will

745
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,719
stop robo calls on its own what is it

746
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:57,240
you know it is an interesting way to

747
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,440
secure SEP so right now most calls most

748
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,440
calls between

749
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,559
Harriers ours are already settled via

750
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,419
sip but ss7 has to be supported because

751
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,629
many older phone systems don't support

752
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:14,129
Seth what sip it's a protocol to deliver

753
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:16,889
voice over IP so this creates a

754
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:19,590
certificate infrastructure for set that

755
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:23,459
basically supersedes the unauthenticated

756
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,870
one today and that allows phone

757
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,659
companies to authenticate themselves

758
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:30,000
with other phone companies it's it's

759
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,620
similar to x.509 or any other kind of

760
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,320
certificate infrastructure that you look

761
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,330
at who's the certificate authority well

762
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,000
that's still to be worked out new star

763
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,439
really wants to be they've they're kind

764
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,679
of looking for a reason to exist right

765
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,450
now but you know who who will that turn

766
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,009
out to be it's gonna be one certificate

767
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,960
authority and that will just be a

768
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:51,960
license to print money for whoever it is

769
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,779
and how is it going to be limited just

770
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,460
to north america actually so the utility

771
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,759
again is limited because the phone

772
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,440
system is global why don't i think this

773
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,539
is going to stop robo calls phone

774
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,850
companies make money from robo calls let

775
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,069
me say that again phone companies make

776
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,509
money from robo calls why would they

777
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:11,550
stop something that's making the money

778
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,889
what they actually care about is being

779
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,599
able to correctly bill for robo calls

780
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,030
and that's kind of a problem right now

781
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,819
because many of the shady phone

782
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,679
companies that are allowing spoofing

783
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:25,168
also are spoofing where they themselves

784
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,069
are coming from they're leaving certain

785
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:31,020
ss7 fields blank that telephone

786
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:34,230
companies were to build those calls back

787
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,780
to and so you know phone companies make

788
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,668
money charging you minutes to deliver

789
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,409
the calls but they don't make money from

790
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:43,049
the phone company that sent the traffic

791
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,000
and they also want to make that so this

792
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,829
is what shaken and stir will really fix

793
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,030
but I don't see that they'll be

794
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:52,950
motivated to stop robo calls themselves

795
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,419
there's no strategy to stop robo calls

796
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,790
from international numbers today so

797
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,710
instead of getting you know calls from

798
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,910
the first three digits through the area

799
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,950
code in the first three digits of your

800
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,098
number and some random for you might

801
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:07,319
start seeing calls from China there's no

802
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,480
strategy to stop robo calls from

803
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,240
domestic numbers that aren't spoofed so

804
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,610
as long as I'm willing to pay you know

805
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,410
dollar 35 to set up a real phone number

806
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,260
I can Robo call you all day under shaken

807
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:21,950
and stirred it doesn't stop me from

808
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,720
doing that all it will do is properly

809
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,419
authenticate what phone company and

810
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,419
number I'm coming from and even if phone

811
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,090
companies wanted to stop robo calls the

812
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,220
technology is so good to do robo calls

813
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,160
these days the platforms are so large

814
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,020
they can push so many calls that you

815
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,180
know it's really a head of phone

816
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,530
company's ability to counteract it at

817
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:47,710
least today and also keep in mind that

818
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,230
the Telecommunications Act of 1996

819
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,820
didn't change anything from 1934 phone

820
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,480
companies are required to deliver all

821
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,510
traffic

822
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,369
so unless phone companies get the legal

823
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,350
ability authority to stop delivering

824
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:02,450
traffic that they suspect might be a

825
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,299
robo call it's not going to move the

826
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,879
needle at all and in all fairness the

827
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,450
FCC did rule that if you are calling

828
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,500
from a number that is disconnected or if

829
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,210
you're claiming to call from a number

830
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,340
that's disconnected or if you are

831
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,400
claiming to call from a public safety

832
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:23,150
answering point a piece app so this is

833
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,160
like a 911 number phone companies are

834
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:29,510
now allowed to block that traffic if

835
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,759
they can reliably detect it but you know

836
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,010
it could go farther I'm just not sure

837
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,730
how much farther we need more than

838
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,130
shaken and stir to do that so what's our

839
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,840
path forward I alluded to this at the

840
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,910
beginning of the talk well maybe we just

841
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,530
go back to fragmentation like at the

842
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,299
very beginning of the phone system like

843
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,880
these are just a few of the messaging

844
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,160
app logos that I was able to find when I

845
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,800
was google searching images yesterday

846
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,220
there are many many many more right and

847
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,470
so we could all install 15 different

848
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:04,609
messaging apps and try to juggle calls

849
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:06,680
between them that's a possibility but I

850
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:08,480
don't think that that's necessarily the

851
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,490
best possibility I think that that's

852
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,460
something that we're doing today in

853
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:15,649
order to adapt to this world that we're

854
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,050
in where you know when your phone rings

855
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,200
you can't really assume that it's

856
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,660
anybody that you know even if the number

857
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,140
is someone that you know

858
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,970
so I'd like to follow a different path I

859
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,250
think that the world's oldest and

860
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,689
largest social network is worth saving

861
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,310
and that's what the phone system is it's

862
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,080
it's the world's oldest and largest

863
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:42,049
social network it has the most reach and

864
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,970
you know by combining the phone system

865
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:46,160
which is the world's oldest and largest

866
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:49,069
social network with a very large social

867
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,920
graph and doing sideband authentication

868
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:54,260
I think that could actually work and so

869
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,230
how would that work what you would do is

870
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,910
if you have a cell phone with the for

871
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,280
example facebook Messenger clan

872
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:04,100
installed you to authenticate your

873
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,590
outbound call with Facebook when

874
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,540
somebody receives that call the

875
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,680
messenger client will check to see

876
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,630
whether or not the call was

877
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,890
authenticated and if it was was you'd

878
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,500
get a blue checkmark or whatever

879
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,589
Facebook decides to do why Facebook you

880
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,860
know I'm not sure I trust Facebook any

881
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,390
more than I can throw them but they have

882
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,430
the largest social network in the world

883
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:29,720
pretty much and not only that they have

884
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,839
everybody's phone book because they

885
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,310
tricked you into giving it to them so

886
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,320
they have the ability to do this they

887
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,570
certainly have the data to do this I

888
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,370
think that the double you know is maybe

889
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,560
better than the double you don't and

890
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,810
it's always possible to regulate this

891
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,080
later on it has happened in history it

892
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:51,100
could happen again so I think that you

893
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,840
know giving Facebook that power is

894
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,110
actually on balance less bad than the

895
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,940
status quo I pitched them I pitched

896
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,500
Google neither of them hired me to do

897
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,210
this so I don't think this is actually

898
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,400
gonna go anywhere with either company

899
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:07,790
but I still think it's a really good

900
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,320
solution so a tour camp I was hanging

901
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,080
out with a freak er who is one of the

902
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,150
few freaks that I know who knows more

903
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,799
than me about telecom and he knows a lot

904
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,980
more than me about telecom he's a really

905
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,620
smart guy he runs the switch for shady

906
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,590
tell if you've ever you know seems shady

907
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:29,839
tell like the yeah awesome I love shady

908
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:31,730
tell it's your fax in a hot tub so you

909
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,800
know one thing can happen when you get

910
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,420
two freaks together and a bottle of very

911
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,880
good scotch and thank you to the random

912
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,410
guy

913
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,019
Scotland who showed up with all the

914
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,960
scotches at your camp because that's

915
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:45,240
what caused this to happen you know it

916
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,119
turns into a very drunk technical

917
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,430
conversation and so we had a drunk

918
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,160
technical conversation and you know a

919
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,680
couple of associations that other people

920
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,549
haven't made we've come up with so what

921
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,609
that is is why don't we just score calls

922
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:05,130
as they come in using data that already

923
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,839
exists and is accessible through

924
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,819
existing telecommunications

925
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,430
infrastructure and what are those things

926
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:15,240
you know LNP data has the number of

927
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,700
imported recently seen am like you know

928
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,308
is that does that data exists is there

929
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,710
you know does it look sketchy

930
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:24,329
'lord data like you know is the number

931
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,019
even routable is this something that's

932
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:31,529
you know that's that's a valid path to

933
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:33,538
get there you know even ss7 messages

934
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:36,259
related to whether or not the call can

935
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:39,690
be completed so we walked through

936
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:42,569
basically every field in ss7 to figure

937
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,599
out what we could use to try to detect

938
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:46,680
whether or not something's a robo call

939
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:49,140
we have something that we think will

940
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,848
stop around 95% and we're actually

941
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,740
prototyping it now it's a research

942
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,109
project I'm not announcing a product

943
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,609
we're way way way off from that we don't

944
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:58,890
even know if this thing works but we

945
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:00,269
think it will work and that's why we're

946
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,190
prototyping it we're looking for

947
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,950
collaborators I need a back-end

948
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,779
developer web developer to integrate a

949
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,549
couple of API is that we need access to

950
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:12,420
so if you're interested I'd love to talk

951
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:13,950
to you to do this for real to get to a

952
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,259
hundred percent or close to that

953
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,149
detection we'd actually need to be a

954
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:20,130
phone company and that costs around a

955
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,660
million dollars so if you're very rich

956
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,279
in the audience and you want to start a

957
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,779
phone company come talk to me after the

958
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:30,359
talk we might be able to work together

959
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:32,519
so with that you know that's the past

960
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,558
and the present and the potential future

961
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,359
of the phone system I've kind of focused

962
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,000
in on you know the biggest problem that

963
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,009
we all have which is robo calls happy to

964
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,289
talk about other topics address other

965
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:46,799
topics if I don't know something I'll

966
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:48,539
tell you I will ask you know one thing

967
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:49,410
that happens a lot is that you know

968
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,780
because we're very

969
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,330
political at hope sometimes we see a

970
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,250
question Mike as a soapbox I don't get

971
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:59,160
to get to all the questions if we

972
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,780
soapbox here so I do encourage you next

973
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,790
time do submit a talk if you want a

974
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:15,780
soapbox but if you have a question I'd

975
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:18,660
love to answer it and thanks very much a

976
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,910
question but off topic of this but could

977
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,299
you give us a one-minute explanation of

978
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:27,149
why we can't trust SMS as like a

979
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,640
two-factor authentication sense oh sure

980
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:32,010
so SMS travels over the same networks

981
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:35,299
that are vulnerable to robo calls and so

982
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,300
you can spoof those too

983
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,549
so sometimes when robo calls come in the

984
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,000
caller ID name field will say like spam

985
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,930
question mark who's putting that data

986
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,820
and there's at the telephone company

987
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,710
that's not recognizing it as a robo call

988
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,840
and marking it spam or is it an honest

989
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,750
Robo caller so that you can filter it

990
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:00,360
know what that is is you have t-mobile

991
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,190
right Yes No maybe

992
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,740
do you have t-mobile is that was my

993
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,450
question - oh you pepper isin okay so

994
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,240
they're implementing this - so there's a

995
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,830
company in Seattle that works with

996
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,299
t-mobile because t-mobile is based in

997
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,680
the Seattle area and they're starting to

998
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,360
work with other phone companies what

999
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,370
they do is they look at some of the same

1000
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,780
kinds of metadata that we're looking at

1001
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,600
but what they're looking at themselves

1002
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,240
is has the same number called thousands

1003
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,330
of people in the last ten minutes and if

1004
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,089
it has what they'll do is throw a flag

1005
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,770
and actually phone companies aren't

1006
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,080
regulated and what they have to deliver

1007
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:43,130
is caller ID data which is why they're

1008
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:45,960
able to substitute you know spam likely

1009
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,880
cool that was gonna be my question as a

1010
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,070
t-mobile user but that makes me think

1011
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,620
also I have a Google Voice number and I

1012
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:53,970
get basically zero spam or anything on

1013
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,620
that do you know what they happen to be

1014
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,270
doing to be so good at it you know

1015
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,180
Google is really good at filtering spam

1016
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,350
that's why G mail is so popular you know

1017
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,089
Facebook actually is also really good

1018
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,620
filtering spam they are amazing at that

1019
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,290
that's why I think there that they are

1020
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,940
by far the best social graph to use with

1021
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,770
this it's just gonna be really hard to

1022
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,980
get past there you know the stuff that

1023
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,200
they've developed for like you know 15

1024
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,490
years stopping automated account

1025
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,830
creation and spam inside their network

1026
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:26,350
so what how does that technology work my

1027
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,940
understanding of how the Google Voice

1028
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,920
product operates is that they've taken

1029
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,150
some of that secret sauce from Gmail and

1030
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,830
applied it to phone spam as well

1031
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:38,440
fantastic talk thank you you really

1032
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:40,569
opened my eyes to one thing that really

1033
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,700
kind of amazed me and that is the number

1034
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,200
of calls that could be made when you'd

1035
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,970
had that slide about Seattle that was

1036
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,710
very impressive but I'm waiting for the

1037
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,859
other shoe to drop where you mentioned

1038
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,230
how profitable it was so do you have any

1039
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,060
information about these spam callers how

1040
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,940
much money they actually make to keep

1041
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,270
them doing this it seems like a lot of

1042
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:03,670
people don't take the bait you know it's

1043
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,740
the same as a sending email spam right

1044
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,650
it's you don't need a whole lot of

1045
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:11,200
responses because it's so cheap to do if

1046
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,330
you can call all of Seattle for 150

1047
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,160
bucks how much do you need to scam

1048
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,950
somebody for to be able to make that up

1049
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,450
and then some and how much money do you

1050
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,160
need to make if you're a scammer in

1051
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:27,600
India where you can comfortably live on

1052
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:30,730
$500 a month I've got two minutes so

1053
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,920
let's keep the next questions quick okay

1054
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,230
I'm a terrible person I have a

1055
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,050
CenturyLink 21 line I used to robocall

1056
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:41,080
Seattle so there's a billing number

1057
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,880
field and a caller ID field and they let

1058
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,170
me spoof the caller ID field and not the

1059
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,750
billing field when they add this

1060
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,970
authentication why would they change

1061
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,530
that why would they stop me from

1062
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:56,230
spoofing the caller ID field so under

1063
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,520
shaken and stir it's really going to be

1064
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,380
up to the carrier that you're

1065
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,170
authenticating with to assert that

1066
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:05,620
whatever you are claiming you're doing

1067
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,660
is legit and so actually yeah like if if

1068
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,089
CenturyLink wants to let you spoof and

1069
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,350
they're willing to sign off on that it's

1070
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,350
totally going to still work

1071
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,280
it sounds like there are a lot of

1072
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,990
parallels between ss7 and BGP right and

1073
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,490
that you just like say this is who I am

1074
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,250
and the network inherently trusts you

1075
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,930
but the way network operators have sort

1076
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,250
of fixed this with BGP is they get

1077
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,720
together and they're like this

1078
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,990
particular network has been a jackass

1079
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,339
for a while now let's just stop trusting

1080
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:37,379
them right let's like kick them off the

1081
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:40,740
internet yeah you can't do that with

1082
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,720
telecom because it's illegal it's like

1083
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,348
first of all even meeting together as

1084
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,939
collusion and then the next problem is

1085
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,640
like the law says you have to deliver

1086
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,369
calls so yeah you can't do that like the

1087
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,109
Internet is is not not regulated the

1088
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:58,339
same way you can you can totally get

1089
00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:01,140
away with stuff you can with phones

1090
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:03,599
about a year and a half ago all the spam

1091
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,970
calls I was getting switched from being

1092
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,099
area codes I didn't know to being my own

1093
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,169
area code and I was wondering if that

1094
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,869
was a result of the change in the system

1095
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,640
or as I've heard from people I don't

1096
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:16,440
necessarily trust to be correct on the

1097
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,450
subject that there was a problem with a

1098
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:22,349
local exchange that leaked a bunch of

1099
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:24,328
information no there's you know there's

1100
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:26,700
two reasons why that's happening I think

1101
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:28,109
the first is people are more likely to

1102
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,129
pick up a call that looks like it's

1103
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:33,180
local and the second is there are there

1104
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,010
have been some changes in the way

1105
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,930
telecom billing happens and this gets

1106
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,400
really wonky and long so and we don't

1107
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:43,430
have the time I've got two more minutes

1108
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:47,520
I think so I had two more minutes so

1109
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:49,529
basically you can get away with billing

1110
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,089
shenanigans more easily using local

1111
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:56,520
numbers versus ones that are remote if s

1112
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:58,230
seven is in place to deal with billing

1113
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,509
issues and you have to collect all this

1114
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:04,470
potentially fraudulent information to

1115
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:06,810
like you know ex post assign cost to

1116
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:10,379
people has the industry ever considered

1117
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:11,730
you know tokenizing payments over like

1118
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,619
the Lightning Network that runs on top

1119
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:17,490
of Bitcoin that basically you front the

1120
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,710
money ex-ante before us you know attempt

1121
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,569
to say hey run this data over your

1122
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,520
network I will pay you for it here's a

1123
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:25,560
crip of Gotham please I totally want to

1124
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,590
wait 13 minutes for all of my calls to

1125
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,840
go through No

1126
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,640
no no but if you're using the lightning

1127
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,690
Network you don't need a if you use the

1128
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,700
lightning Network you don't need to wait

1129
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,080
on a block it's it's instantaneously you

1130
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,520
essentially yeah no let go pitch

1131
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,090
blockchain to somebody else I don't care

1132
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,009
I think it has that I don't mean to be a

1133
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:43,780
jerk i I think we ran in there like we

1134
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,100
it's it's Apple it's the blockchain part

1135
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:54,550
of the question all right thanks guys

1136
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:54,549
[Applause]
