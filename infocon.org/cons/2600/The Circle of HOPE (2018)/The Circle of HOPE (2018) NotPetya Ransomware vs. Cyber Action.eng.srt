1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:07,350
thank you thank you can you hear me

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,660
perfect I can't see anything just so you

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,518
know if I look very strange like I have

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,500
two spotlights on me and that's that's

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,330
all I see it's an interesting experience

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,230
all right

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,150
my name is rule Schaumburg and yeah I'm

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,189
gonna be talking about the interesting

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,779
bits of a non petty I think most of the

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,640
people in the room will be familiar with

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,779
some of the aspects of not pet yet but

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,270
there's a lot more to it let me do a

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,460
brief introduction on myself I've been

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,230
nice I spend most of my time on the East

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,760
Coast and have been in intersect for

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,099
about 20 years give or take and I've

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,649
done all sorts of different stuff from

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,320
threat Intel now we're reversing black

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:55,260
box white box whatever related to not

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
Pecha I have also been doing quite a lot

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,780
of disinformation and fake news research

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,559
and analysis over the last and now give

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,900
or take five years and that's where the

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
focus on North America Europe and a

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,520
little bit of Asia it helps being

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,170
multilingual doing this kind of stuff

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,399
and seeing you know commonalities and

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,030
differences between different campaigns

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,390
and I guess with that what I'm trying to

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,780
say is I like working on tactical stuff

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,610
so doing you know simple reversing so to

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,490
say but I also like looking at strategic

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,220
long-term campaigns that's been months

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,079
years or even longer than that I will

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,170
also note that I'm not a lawyer there's

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,000
gonna be using a couple terms during

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,890
this talk and you know some of those

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,049
terms are contentious if you want to you

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,240
know argue with me about the definition

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,310
of war we can do it after the talk I

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,579
won't get very excited but maybe you

43
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,329
will but you know whatever floats your

44
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:04,380
boat you may have also recently seen

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,279
some of our work in the media looking at

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,639
the USB fan that was

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,650
being handed out at the Singapore summit

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,609
so that that's a little different from

49
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,950
you know regular reversing here's the

50
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,960
mandatory marketing site its lied about

51
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,820
Celsius advisory group I don't want to

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,380
spend a whole lot of time on here but

53
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,630
you know we do a lot of stuff as you can

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,250
see here you do both offensive and

55
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:36,250
defensive work you know and yeah it's a

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:40,000
lot of fun so here's the agenda for the

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,190
talk today I as I said like I think

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,440
everybody knows not Pecha but I want to

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,709
go a little bit over you know what

60
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,870
haven't we really publicly talked about

61
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,300
because there's a very clear narrative

62
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,970
that that's certainly in the in depress

63
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,730
and so on and I think there's a couple

64
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:03,820
things that are missing there so that's

65
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:06,488
what we'll be going over right so you

66
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,900
know over the last couple years we've

67
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:13,900
been introduced if you will to two new

68
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,480
types of threats or maybe revived types

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,670
of threats gusta for kind of comes to

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,170
mind right where we you know this is

71
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,079
kind of something new it's not something

72
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,720
different and from from where I stand

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,640
not Pecha kind of you know was something

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,090
different altogether as well it was a

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:36,369
new blend of computer network operations

76
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:40,420
and psyops and you know that's what I

77
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:44,140
think it's misunderstood and that that's

78
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,750
part of the strategy that the people

79
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,190
behind not in that picture were really

80
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:54,700
going for and what we need to keep in

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,280
mind here is that we really tend to

82
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,048
focus on the tactical level even you

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,510
know when you look at fake news and if

84
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,519
this information as a whole we keep

85
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,010
talking about Twitter and Facebook bots

86
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,079
and you know it's not it's not very

87
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,140
forward-looking

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:15,640
and you know my personal take away from

89
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:18,130
not petia was that this is gonna this in

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,060
history not that you all be as important

91
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,060
as let's say Stuxnet or

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,600
ever I think we'll see a book or two not

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,840
written by me I don't like writing books

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,730
but that's where we'll go so let's look

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,789
at the premise of not Pecha that you

96
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,610
know everybody should be aware of but

97
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,180
you know just as a refresher right it's

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,000
June 27th of last year it's been give or

99
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,570
take a month since want to cry you know

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,590
everybody's still kind of you know

101
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,889
trying to recover from that

102
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,380
assuming you have clients that were

103
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,250
victim to that and all of a sudden you

104
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,960
know you you see another ransom worm or

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,720
whatever you want to call it break out

106
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,330
and you know the mainstream media starts

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,580
picking up on it and this is this is one

108
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,130
of the headlines from from that

109
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,570
particular day and they're kind of all

110
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,860
the same right kind of I have this and

111
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,050
not sure if two people in the back and

112
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,030
read it right but it's very clear that

113
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,760
there's this huge thing happening in

114
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,950
Ukraine but it's spreading right it's

115
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,690
spreading to to the west and you know

116
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,360
more and more companies are getting hit

117
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,539
and some of these companies are let's

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,050
say a critical infrastructure ish while

119
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:39,320
others are very clearly more in the

120
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:43,160
civilian space so everybody well not

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,740
everybody but you know quite quite a few

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,970
companies are getting hit and people are

123
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,630
getting sent home

124
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,030
you know it's yeah that's kind of it you

125
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,909
know it's like oh we're infected we

126
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,250
can't do anything it's time to go home

127
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,960
because IT will be busy recovering this

128
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:05,479
for the rest of the day right so I mean

129
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,049
how big how big was this again I think

130
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,599
most of you people will know but as we

131
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,000
saw in SEC filings and so on you know

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,910
there were numerous multinationals who

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,830
you know calculated the COS it you know

134
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,039
hundreds of millions of dollars for

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,469
multiple quarters right so that that's a

136
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,780
lot of money right and if you look at

137
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,370
the companies that were hit in the West

138
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,640
there are quite a lot of them were in

139
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,480
the logistics supply chain right and

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,180
that is

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,190
I mean that's how you move Goods right

142
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,490
so that that's that's critical

143
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,480
infrastructure it be that you know FedEx

144
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,100
or be that musk or the Port of Rotterdam

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,470
you know this is this is vital

146
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,670
infrastructure that was down right the

147
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,700
Port of Rotterdam the most automated

148
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,800
terminal terminal 3 was 100% automated

149
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,229
you know that really hurt that took a

150
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,050
long that took weeks to get regain a

151
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,450
full operational capability and and

152
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,580
that's really you know what we need to

153
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,400
think about we need to redefine costs

154
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,700
right because there there's a huge

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,200
difference between let's say losing you

156
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,670
know as a company losing a million

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,280
dollars if you're a large multinational

158
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,990
losing in million dollars you know let's

159
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
say you know it just evaporates out of

160
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,280
the bank account you know that's not

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,810
really a big deal you know that that's

162
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,719
uncomfortable that's not cool

163
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,890
but you know in the in the end you know

164
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,260
it doesn't really matter it doesn't

165
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,510
impact your business productivity your

166
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,719
business continuity not that you on the

167
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,430
other hand you know was designed to to

168
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,820
to wreak havoc

169
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,280
you know ransomware ultimately you know

170
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,520
impacts your business continuity process

171
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:54,049
and again if you couple that back to the

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,330
logistics supply chain companies you

173
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,250
know it really hurt it you know it

174
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,810
cripples a business and if you're a

175
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,950
small business that might actually mean

176
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,990
the end of your business so I want to

177
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,320
take a little bit of time going over

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,420
certain terms again because when I look

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,099
at Twitter and you know I'm not a

180
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,990
Twitter engineer or whatever the new

181
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,660
term is when you spend a lot of time on

182
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,160
Twitter you know sharing your opinion

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,300
I'd like retweet things that's kind of

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,690
what I do and stick to that so when most

185
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,730
people talk about IO on Twitter they're

186
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,730
talking about influencer operations even

187
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,220
when they are say they mean information

188
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,920
operations information operations you

189
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,920
know cover the full gamut of electronic

190
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,959
warfare computer network operations you

191
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,728
know and psychological operations

192
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,370
military deception all that kind of good

193
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,810
stuff that

194
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,120
you know and it said that's one one big

195
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,550
thing rat rather than just the the

196
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,250
influence ops or you know the Desai ops

197
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,439
part of it right so so there's this

198
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,990
entire conversation that we're trying to

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,050
have about some of these things it

200
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,970
doesn't doesn't help that we're not you

201
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,209
know sticking to the proper terminology

202
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,029
and you know what you can kind of glean

203
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,100
from from the description of information

204
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,320
operations it's very important to

205
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,200
realize that you know cyber cyber is

206
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,390
only an enabler and I do apologize I

207
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,660
can't really say the word cyber and

208
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:28,620
earnest is it's so overused so sometimes

209
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,949
I just say cyber cyber you know it gets

210
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,110
to you anyhow

211
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,260
so that that is really you know the

212
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,150
important thing right cyber is not an

213
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,260
you know it's not an end goal it just

214
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:46,310
means to an end and that's that we don't

215
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,839
you shouldn't make it more than that

216
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,770
right and I want to talk a little bit

217
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,350
you know about the Desai ops portion of

218
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,970
this right and and how I don't want to

219
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,089
make this a whole you know fake news

220
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,940
this information talk but you know the

221
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,400
24-hour news cycle is really driving

222
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,520
that tactical narrative right because we

223
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,250
were being flooded with new news so that

224
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,610
makes it very very hard for for most

225
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,500
people to do the strategic analysis on

226
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,170
the one hand and to you know there's

227
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,240
there's no time to read up on strategic

228
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,029
analysis strategic analysis doesn't

229
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,420
really fit into the 24-hour news cycle

230
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:30,209
which you know is of great help for the

231
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,630
the adversary but you know doesn't help

232
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,489
us and for the most part they're

233
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,250
therefore for the most part it's all

234
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,860
about that initial news cycle unless you

235
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,779
know the adversary is you know trying to

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,690
post a push a message for a prolonged

237
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:48,810
period of time by by establishing a more

238
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,520
strategic narrative and we'll see you

239
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,650
know how not patch it was actually

240
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,730
trying to accomplish that a little bit

241
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:59,130
later and you know along the same lines

242
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,290
I talked to quite a few people who do

243
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,780
like fact-checking initiatives and so on

244
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,020
to try and you know show that this was

245
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:10,110
misinformation or disinformation and you

246
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,560
know for the general audience it doesn't

247
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,140
really doesn't move the needle and it

248
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,969
doesn't deter the adversary if I could

249
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,860
actually see the audience I would ask

250
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,940
you guys how many people use two-factor

251
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,980
authentication

252
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,600
I would probably see like a significant

253
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:31,380
amount of people but again I can't see

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:34,380
anything and you know that is a that

255
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,910
shows that you know we are we are not

256
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,770
the general audience most people don't

257
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,209
use two-factor authentication or

258
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,980
certainly not for you know that their

259
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,280
own accounts maybe they're mandated but

260
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,700
so by the by their employer but you know

261
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,630
I think Google said like less than four

262
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,990
one percent of Gmail users use 2fa so

263
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:58,620
you know we are not the general audience

264
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,540
right so can I have to always keep that

265
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,660
in mind what's the messaging here and

266
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:08,939
who is the intended intended audience so

267
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,370
right where or it gets really

268
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,010
interesting is when you start looking at

269
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,400
cross domain multi-layer information

270
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,350
operations because at that point you can

271
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,270
start using complexity as a weapon and

272
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,060
if you couple that back to the 24-hour

273
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,270
news cycle it gets even better right

274
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,430
so in general and with not patch in

275
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,160
particular you need a lot of expertise

276
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:35,510
in a lot of different areas to you know

277
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,430
get a proper appreciation of what the

278
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:41,460
responsible team was trying to achieve

279
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,229
right and I know we as a community we

280
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,020
tend to dislike security through

281
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,480
obscurity but complexity is definitely a

282
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,400
weapon when you know you need subject

283
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,400
matter experts in both computer science

284
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,870
you know and the humanities and all that

285
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,610
good stuff and you kind of have to get

286
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,110
them together into a room and you know

287
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,670
and lawyers too don't forget the lawyers

288
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,510
you have to get everybody into a room

289
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,059
and you know kind of do that analysis

290
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,919
and everybody does their analysis and

291
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,868
I have to do analysis on that and kind

292
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,149
of try and figure out you know what what

293
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:16,979
are people going for here and that you

294
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,139
know who has time for that right who

295
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:21,059
does that plus you know how do I write I

296
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,369
was seized for this you know it gets

297
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,559
very complicated I I just want my you

298
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:28,259
know my house seized I want my you know

299
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,939
my malicious domains my hash is some

300
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,589
other stuff you know put that into my

301
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:33,449
sim and I want to be done with it I

302
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,639
don't want to think about you know any

303
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:40,858
of this stuff like what do I do with

304
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:44,249
that all right but over all right like

305
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:47,459
why in this particular space you know do

306
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:49,289
you have this that is influence op

307
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,029
element to it well it's for the most

308
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,819
part about maintaining plausible

309
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,649
deniability and that plausible

310
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:58,019
deniability doesn't need to persist you

311
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,449
know forever just like you know when we

312
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,889
talk about encryption we you know for

313
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,689
the most part to kind of think well you

314
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,389
know if I encrypt it today it'll be good

315
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:09,029
for you know 20 years well no you know

316
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,829
that that's not it you know we should

317
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:14,459
not expect the encryption of the day to

318
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:17,358
be good for you no good in 20 years

319
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:24,478
that's unlikely

320
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:27,119
so some additional perspective on you

321
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:29,369
know influence ops psyops whatever you

322
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:32,059
want to call them right is from URI

323
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:34,379
Benjamin of I think he was actually

324
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:36,629
being mentioned on Twitter again this

325
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,349
week and a lot of people like

326
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:44,759
referencing his talk from I think in

327
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:47,549
1984 and go figure but what is important

328
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:51,749
to realize here is that a businessman

329
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:53,848
I've actually defected in 1970 so you

330
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:55,519
can go on YouTube and you can go watch

331
00:14:53,849 --> 00:15:00,659
his talks and you know get a better

332
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:02,669
appreciation for what strategic psyops

333
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,009
really are right it's not you know

334
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,929
something that not a campaign that lasts

335
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,089
for three or six months or one or two

336
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:11,519
years no you know ultimately this could

337
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,099
be a multi-generational effort right and

338
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,249
then you can contrast with that to the

339
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:20,429
conversation that we're currently having

340
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,230
about you know how the American public

341
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,149
is being in

342
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,639
and again we talked about you know

343
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:28,730
Facebook BOTS and Twitter BOTS it's very

344
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,879
very primitive compared to what Yuri was

345
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,670
talking about and again 1970s close to

346
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,429
fifty years ago right fifty years ago

347
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:41,660
it's like virtually two generations so

348
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:45,279
we can safely assume that you know these

349
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:50,149
methods and tactics have really evolved

350
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:53,179
through that half century so from the

351
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,559
technical perspective I'm sure that

352
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:56,959
everybody here is familiar with

353
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,669
ransomware right yeah different tear

354
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,790
operator some people do the encryption

355
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:03,619
well some people you know really suck

356
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,540
some people just lie and say that you

357
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,749
know your stuff is encrypted you know

358
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,849
whatever whatever makes money right and

359
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:13,850
ransomware was and certainly it still is

360
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,919
really quite popular and it makes a lot

361
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,040
of sense from a cybercrime perspective

362
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,919
because if you want to steal somebody's

363
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,379
you know banking information and drain

364
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,089
their bank account or steal the credit

365
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:29,839
card information you have to worry about

366
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:32,149
things like fraud controls etc etc but

367
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,910
you know if you either go after

368
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:37,639
individuals or target a company with

369
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,559
ransomware you know that there's a you

370
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,959
know there's either personal photos or

371
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,719
you know a business continuity problem

372
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,268
that you know that particular target you

373
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,999
know they want to get that fixed so if

374
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,279
the target decides to pay you to pay the

375
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:53,540
attacker money you know they intend to

376
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,249
do that they want to make that

377
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,868
transaction happen so that's really

378
00:16:55,249 --> 00:17:02,419
attractive for for the attacker but what

379
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:05,389
ransomware also is right it's a great

380
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,730
cover for action right as I said

381
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:10,158
ransomware if you target a company

382
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,529
effectively it you know stops your

383
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,510
business productivity right so what if

384
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,510
you just decide you know to deploy that

385
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,220
ransomware and you know no matter how

386
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,349
much money the target is going to give

387
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,679
you you're never going to give them the

388
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:27,198
decryption keys for for their files or

389
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,500
for to you know whatever the attacker

390
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,470
just encrypted server images you name it

391
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,379
right so we that this really is

392
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,909
it's very convenient from an attack of

393
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:41,730
perspective right because we think of

394
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,559
ransomware as some criminal things for

395
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,899
for criminal elements but really anyone

396
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,129
can use it for computer network attack

397
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:52,379
right a disruptive type of attack so

398
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:54,779
this cover is great because it is isn't

399
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:56,730
immediately obvious you know who is

400
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,919
behind this and what the motivation is

401
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:02,039
for this particular attack you know I'm

402
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,809
like let's say Stuxnet right if we want

403
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,269
to look back the Stuxnet which you know

404
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:09,320
a lot you know and people love to you

405
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:11,730
know talk about Stuxnet so in this this

406
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,009
disregard you you can kind of see you

407
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,919
know well all these old days you know

408
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:19,139
oh just targeting you know nuclear stuff

409
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,789
and Natanz well you know there's only

410
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:25,678
handful of countries in the world with

411
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:27,480
the necessary facilities to test to

412
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,120
actually test Stuxnet and see if it

413
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,700
works right so it's it's kind of like

414
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,258
you know your Special Forces team when

415
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,220
you when you see them you know you know

416
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,750
what they are right so they it's all

417
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,460
clandestine the Special Forces team

418
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,470
tries to remain hidden all that good

419
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,629
stuff but you know if they get exposed

420
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,830
you know what they are and you know it's

421
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:53,610
very obvious right ransomware is it's

422
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,370
much better in that regard which leads

423
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,600
me to the you know into the logical

424
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,059
evolution of the question you know what

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,469
is attribution and you know how much of

426
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,850
the app you know how much of the

427
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,340
conversation we have in the public

428
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,439
domain these days it's really just

429
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,699
conjecture right because what what is

430
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,440
real attribution and I would add that

431
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,730
that that particular question becomes

432
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,899
more important as the geopolitical

433
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,639
stakes get higher right so if you want

434
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:27,928
to look at something like you know not

435
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:30,299
petia you don't want to you know be

436
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:33,269
looking at the Martha I don't know you

437
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,639
know who watches the American sea or who

438
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:37,889
watch the Americans here but you know

439
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:41,399
poor poor Martha you know work for the

440
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:43,678
FBI she got recruited by the KGB you

441
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:45,299
know and she did work you know she did

442
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,910
work for them right but from an

443
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,820
intelligence perspective you know

444
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,980
see Martha matters but from a greater

445
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,860
intelligence perspective you know who is

446
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,980
who is controlling Martha right so so

447
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,189
you know proper attribution can only be

448
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,350
done through infiltration and that you

449
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,000
know it be that you know real human

450
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,600
infiltration or technical infiltration

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,420
you know that that is clearly the domain

452
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,179
of governments that is not the domain of

453
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,670
the private sector so most of the

454
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,820
attribution conversation that we that I

455
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,040
see in a public space is mostly

456
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,710
conjecture certainly as the stakes get

457
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,020
higher right and the the nation-state

458
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,210
actors have you know a special

459
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,250
capabilities both on the offensive and

460
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,280
defensive side all right so you need to

461
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,230
know about motive and intent right all

462
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,430
right like with the indictments that we

463
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:44,130
we saw recently right against the firm

464
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,480
from the DOJ to GRU you see like they

465
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,910
they have an idea of the command

466
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,710
structure they have the names right so

467
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,110
at that point it becomes the story

468
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,860
becomes reasonably clear this was a you

469
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,469
know these were approved operations etc

470
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,870
etc I did this wasn't somebody doing

471
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,240
something in their free time you know

472
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,850
using company infrastructure no this was

473
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,930
this was an actual op so that that you

474
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:12,389
know that is the the kind of detail that

475
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,070
that really is needed when you you go

476
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:20,370
into this particular space and again

477
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:23,639
that that is as government stuff so that

478
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:28,070
leads me very quickly into the not

479
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,360
patchy attribution you know I think CIA

480
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,600
GCHQ and others have come out you know

481
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,209
this all points to GRU apt 28 in

482
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,820
particular I mean you've been reading

483
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,010
the news so I think that's that's pretty

484
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,679
clear even I have a White House

485
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:46,730
statement in it right where the White

486
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,520
House says not patches the most costly

487
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,070
attack that we've seen today right so

488
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,040
that's I think fairly fairly well

489
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,000
established and there hasn't been any

490
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,510
evidence

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,240
you know to suggest anything otherwise

492
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:06,840
right so once you have established that

493
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,600
you know that you know the GRU was the

494
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,179
team behind not Petra right you kind of

495
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,959
need to look at the bigger picture and

496
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,390
get an appreciation for you know how

497
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,400
this particular actor behaves

498
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:26,400
because again cyber is only an enabler

499
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:29,880
right and given that it's GRU it's a

500
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,390
patch or quote unquote originated in

501
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,580
Ukraine so you know you kind of have to

502
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,550
look into that particular context right

503
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,679
so Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and

504
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,200
ever since you know it's been as I say

505
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,590
you know all IO all the time it's you

506
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,410
know it's one big mess and throughout

507
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,100
the last couple years or throughout

508
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,700
those I guess forward four years

509
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,580
we you've seemed very targeted sabotage

510
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,840
operations against you know power plants

511
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,730
etc etc but not Petra clearly was

512
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,550
something something different right it

513
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:11,310
spread to other countries well didn't

514
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:14,760
really spread you know it was you know

515
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:19,409
was unleashed on other countries as well

516
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,960
if you will so right and I guess the

517
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,180
point with the dip this particular slide

518
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:29,460
is trying to make is that when we look

519
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:32,910
at this particular actors behavior also

520
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,160
in the physical domain right we see that

521
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,830
it's all about plausible deniability and

522
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,260
not sure you know who here remembers the

523
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,260
little green men that started showing up

524
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,940
in Crimea in 2014 but you know it was

525
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,550
something entirely different they didn't

526
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,060
have the little patches on you know they

527
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:54,180
were unmarked which is not it's not okay

528
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:58,260
by international norms to say the least

529
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,150
right and you know that initial

530
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,420
deniability

531
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,670
you know just allowed things to to move

532
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,130
on and move on and I think today you

533
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,350
know the Russian government has been

534
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:14,780
quite open about you know how it was

535
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:17,969
them all along but you know as you the

536
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:21,480
objective here really is to make it more

537
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,669
expensive to react to a particular act

538
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,470
from the adversary and that expense

539
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,929
could be either in resources or in

540
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,760
political capital right who wants to

541
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,070
respond to something that happened you

542
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,770
know one one or two years ago right it's

543
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,428
much easier to just kind of let it slide

544
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:42,240
right and and and that kind of brings me

545
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:46,309
to you know my trigger word which is a

546
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,309
hybrid warfare excuse me while I drink

547
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,850
so for those unfamiliar hybrid warfare

548
00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:00,389
is some relatively new term and talks

549
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,240
about you know the idea of irregular

550
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,159
asymmetric warfare where the the

551
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,330
adversary is using different you know

552
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:11,250
mechanisms to really you know tow the

553
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:15,990
line and you know remain in that

554
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,570
conflict boundary to not you know to to

555
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:22,049
not do actual acts of war but you know

556
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,789
just skirt blind so so it's it's kind of

557
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,330
like a legal game and as I said I'm not

558
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:29,760
a lawyer but you know lawyers get really

559
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:33,168
animated about this right so this is

560
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,090
where there is you know where there's

561
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:38,010
unclarity or gaps in the law that's just

562
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,100
operational opportunity for the

563
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,129
adversary so right so Russia in

564
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,840
particular loves playing in this space

565
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,799
personally from where I stand I dislike

566
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:57,689
the term hybrid warfare excuse me while

567
00:25:49,799 --> 00:26:02,400
I drink to me that that is a concept you

568
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,710
know that I don't think that our

569
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,630
adversaries believe in a concept of

570
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:12,030
peace time and the and therefore there's

571
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,419
no such thing as hybrid warfare that's

572
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,418
my opinion

573
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,679
well one and that wonderful note I want

574
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,730
to move on to you know it's on act to

575
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,410
actually not pet you you know

576
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,660
kind of you know talk about that more

577
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,510
more you know on the tactical level so

578
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,080
not petia you know what's being pushed

579
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:37,160
through this mandatory sort of quasi

580
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,050
mandatory a tax accounting software

581
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,750
that's used if you want to do business

582
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:46,850
in Ukraine right and and it's not like

583
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,630
so if you do business with with any

584
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:53,719
entities in Ukraine even as a you know a

585
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:57,290
foreign company you know you need to use

586
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:02,210
one of two approved tax accounting

587
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:04,100
software and Medoc was the name of the

588
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:08,080
software that not patchy was being

589
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,540
pushed through right so from from from a

590
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,399
C&O perspective this was done superbly

591
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:19,300
well because the the C 2 channel was

592
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,460
actually hosted on the Medoc

593
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,040
infrastructure itself right so did it

594
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,380
there's nothing suspicious at all right

595
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,980
if you you just kind of do some casual

596
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:34,340
traffic analysis and so on then even as

597
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:39,890
the implant is being pushed up to to the

598
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,419
targets it just goes right so all those

599
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,250
wonderful seems out there they they

600
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,490
would not have picked that up that kind

601
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,350
of behavior plus is a trusted channel

602
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,840
right it's trusted software or whatever

603
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,280
that means these days right so so for a

604
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,990
firm it's you know perspective this was

605
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,139
really well done this was really smooth

606
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,140
and would have a very very high chance

607
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:04,210
of you know not being picked up at least

608
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:07,610
initially by security software right and

609
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:10,970
as as these as this implant was being

610
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:14,209
pushed out through the trusted supply

611
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,950
chain right and you know that the

612
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,980
malware got installed on to the victim

613
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,340
boxes you know not that you would start

614
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,190
and encrypting or destroying these these

615
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:28,010
files and after some amount of time the

616
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:30,590
machine would reboot and give you you

617
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,960
know the that particular screen if you

618
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,090
want to you know recover your files use

619
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,880
the Bitcoin address

620
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,580
you know and there's $300 worth Bitcoin

621
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,400
to this particular address and then send

622
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:45,158
your Bitcoin wallet idea ID to this

623
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,960
particular email address and very very

624
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,880
very quickly you know somebody thought

625
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,640
it was a smart idea to shut down this

626
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,230
email address which you know when you're

627
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,779
dealing with a global outbreak maybe

628
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,720
that's not you know what you want to do

629
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:02,140
because sometimes you know file recovery

630
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,549
and paying the the attacker is still

631
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:09,130
better than not having your files

632
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:11,610
yes but plus it helps tracking that

633
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,380
that's entirely true so I you know

634
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:20,889
whatever I mean not not the point but

635
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:22,809
that annoyed be so again it's important

636
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,720
here to realize that every you know

637
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,940
every user of this médoc software was

638
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,460
getting the software and every you know

639
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:34,200
every person or company that wants to do

640
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:37,120
business in or with Ukraine you know

641
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,190
what was well was running I tore me doc

642
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,168
or the other piece of software right so

643
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,570
so so that was the target target

644
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:51,610
demographic was users of Medoc software

645
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:53,770
right so so as I said you know it starts

646
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,559
spreading within your local network what

647
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,330
was interesting about not petia versus

648
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,029
wanna cry right wanna cry kind of

649
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,710
indiscriminately went after wan

650
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:05,399
addresses just you know spreading

651
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,990
globally very very aggressively again

652
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,840
they're not petia actors decided that

653
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,799
they want to keep the the spreading

654
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:18,480
mechanism local right so again that this

655
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:22,270
non-discriminating of specific networks

656
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:27,210
a lot was said about you know how it was

657
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:30,340
using eternal blue you know the leaked

658
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,140
exploit and all that and that that was

659
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,299
from my perspective very interesting

660
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,120
i'll get back to that in a little bit so

661
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,820
it was using eternal blue many cats PS

662
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,340
exact and WMI to do all this lateral

663
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:47,649
movement and just spreading spreading

664
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:50,620
within these networks me etc etc and

665
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,510
you know ten billion dollars worth of

666
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:57,070
damages you know that and that's the

667
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:58,780
estimate okay right so so that that was

668
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,809
that so it was very expensive

669
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,090
you know I it targeted you know these

670
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:07,740
these uses of this there's tax software

671
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:10,449
right so let's look at the the narrative

672
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,770
evolution for a little bit right so so

673
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,920
that this is where it kind of gets

674
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:17,230
interesting right so what the the

675
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,809
attackers had done very cleverly right

676
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:23,110
is they had taken this existing piece of

677
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:25,210
malware called petia an existing

678
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,580
ransomware and he had manually patched

679
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,160
it and you know he would love to go

680
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,260
through the manual patching effort with

681
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,790
all you guys but you know I only have

682
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,629
like 45 minutes and ultimately that is

683
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,879
not the point

684
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:43,870
the idea the point was that you know

685
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,420
they took piece of malware to an

686
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:49,149
existing piece of malware to to confuse

687
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,460
researchers right and to to get that

688
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,460
initial narrative out there yes now oh

689
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,150
we have this new strain of ransomware

690
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,640
it's using you know eternal blue and you

691
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:04,030
know things are not looking so good and

692
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,429
then because the email account got taken

693
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,309
down very shortly after the the

694
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:12,250
narrative was really all about you know

695
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:14,260
well you can't recover your files so

696
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,900
fast forward a little bit and it becomes

697
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:20,080
clear hey this is a patched piece of

698
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:25,059
malware you know this is a false flag

699
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:32,050
operation right and in in cyber cyber

700
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:33,730
cyber false flag operations haven't been

701
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,370
that exciting right but in the real

702
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,670
world we've seen false flag operations

703
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,290
lead to actual you know and you know

704
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:45,070
people get it or countries getting drawn

705
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:46,928
into war so so you know that those are

706
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:54,850
sort of the stakes right again it's not

707
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:56,650
a technical cyber cyber point so so it

708
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,310
becomes clear this is this is something

709
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,010
else

710
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,500
and it also turns out that hey that you

711
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,379
know that entire ransomware

712
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,350
aridif you know the decryption will

713
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:11,640
never work so recoveries impossible even

714
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:13,679
if that account was was active you know

715
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,530
and that kind of becomes the narrative

716
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,230
and that's kind of it right and kind of

717
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,600
kind of look at the retrospective from

718
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,520
from last month and that that's kind of

719
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,560
where people go well you know that was

720
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,650
interesting and kind of leave it at that

721
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,000
right but that sounds obvious but but

722
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,240
obviously there's there's a little more

723
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,210
and I I don't think we the the stuff

724
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,430
that it's you know where I'm coming from

725
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,640
that we've had any public conversation

726
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:45,750
about this which again makes you know

727
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:55,440
properly analyzing these campaigns much

728
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:58,680
more complicated so if we look at the

729
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,100
spreading mechanism of not petia you

730
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,150
know it was all about that lateral

731
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,240
movement you had the initial deployment

732
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,100
to the Medoc users and then all those

733
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,850
different mechanisms were about lateral

734
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:15,810
movement but as anyone you know anyone

735
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:19,889
who's ever done red team exercising can

736
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:24,210
tell you you know PPS exact WMI many

737
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:27,510
cats are more than enough to spread

738
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,490
through a network right and I hadn't

739
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,409
Matt mentioned this yet

740
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,469
but we actually had some clients that

741
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:37,860
were affected by not petia and you know

742
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:40,529
this is what we saw here as well also

743
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,830
after you know post wanna cry most

744
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,260
people you know most people wanted to

745
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:53,310
apply the eternal blue patches etc etc

746
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:55,320
so I'm strongly convinced and I 100

747
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,650
percent certain that the inclusion of

748
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:03,420
eternal blue was not needed for C&O

749
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,970
success right but the inclusion of

750
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,400
eternal blue also right following wanna

751
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,430
cry right after wanna cry you know

752
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,860
became a major narrative around not

753
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,450
petia right and it kind of reinforced

754
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,300
the narrow

755
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:20,029
of of wanna cry right here were these

756
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,980
you know these exploits these these evil

757
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,050
exploits you know and and this is this

758
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,650
is a problem right you you saw the US

759
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,220
government

760
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,140
you saw them respond to you know wow you

761
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,328
didn't see them or didn't necessarily

762
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,230
see them respond to net petia you saw

763
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:38,530
them respond to the fallout of you know

764
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:41,300
gee are you leveraging eternal blue

765
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:44,630
right so so that was a very distinct

766
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:47,420
narrative change so from where I stand

767
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,990
it would be absolutely brilliant from a

768
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,500
sigh of an influence up you know to

769
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:57,589
include eternal blue just to to to sway

770
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,560
that narrative right and I think you

771
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:02,930
know if that were the case if the the

772
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,560
actor did do that I think they succeeded

773
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:09,200
in this very very well right and and and

774
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,700
this is something that I don't think has

775
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,950
been explored at all in the public

776
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,839
domain of not just doing you know some

777
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,319
sort of false flag but deliberately

778
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:21,890
planting particular technical measures

779
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,310
if you will to drive a particular

780
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,779
narrative and and you know and that I

781
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,040
think makes things a little bit more

782
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,690
complicated and we need better strategic

783
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:36,290
analysis because if you're just trying

784
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,790
to hit that 24-hour news cycle this is

785
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,450
this is going to be overlooked

786
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,450
right

787
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:59,089
so all right so if we look at the

788
00:36:52,670 --> 00:37:00,859
eternal blue aspect we also have to you

789
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:03,470
know and put that kind of an it in a

790
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:05,390
different light we also need to be

791
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,899
talking a little bit more about you know

792
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:13,390
what was the was a bigger agenda here

793
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:16,789
and again that is very very hard because

794
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,490
you know attribution versus conjecture

795
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:22,569
but what we what we can do about looking

796
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:26,629
at the facts right like we know that the

797
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:28,880
GRU was inside the Medoc infrastructure

798
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,099
you know ahead of time

799
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,410
they didn't just you know get it get

800
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,150
into the medaka infrastructure and

801
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,799
immediately deployed not pet you know

802
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,690
there was a reconnaissance phase they

803
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:42,319
had some I they had an idea of you know

804
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:45,559
who was using this plus obviously GRU

805
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:47,960
our Ukraine experts right this is this

806
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:54,890
should be obvious right so they have

807
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:58,579
very deep very deep knowledge of their

808
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:01,848
adversary so they have an understanding

809
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:07,549
of what this looks like and then who

810
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:11,720
uses it so again the target was me doc

811
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:13,490
users it wasn't me doc users in Ukraine

812
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,529
all right and that's an important

813
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:18,169
distinction can make the argument here

814
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:20,000
that most of the ops that were conducted

815
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,539
in this way were really strictly focused

816
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,700
on Ukraine

817
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:29,000
so was this you know once this sloppy

818
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,669
work front from from an otherwise very

819
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,130
very tidy team a team that you know many

820
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:37,819
consider to be you know on the top of

821
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:39,650
the on the top of their game it's hard

822
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:41,690
to tell again without having that that

823
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,589
insight knowledge but that plausible

824
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:50,539
deniability is something that they love

825
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:53,269
to leverage and the intended side the

826
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:55,670
intent the the effects of not petra

827
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:58,220
right certainly against a lot logistical

828
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:00,349
supply chain or logistic supply chain

829
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,009
these are indistinguishable from what

830
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,410
would

831
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:06,680
being object legitimate objective during

832
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:08,810
quote-unquote cyber war right if there's

833
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,899
an actual conflict a real conflict or

834
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,700
actual war you know you would in an

835
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,130
adversary would love to hit you know

836
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,250
ports and so on they would love to hit

837
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:22,790
be the equivalent of aesthetics etc etc

838
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,600
because it deprives the enemy from

839
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,759
shipping

840
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,230
you know goods be that food or be that

841
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,510
you know other types of supplies

842
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:35,330
military supplies and so on right so

843
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:37,670
this was either you know a test run you

844
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,940
know an intended test run or you know an

845
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:43,070
accidental test run to see you know how

846
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,960
the west would would respond both you

847
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:51,710
know on an operational level as well as

848
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:54,500
a policy level which you know given the

849
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,710
response we've seen so far from from the

850
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,390
West you know III think you're

851
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,430
potentially looking at you know an

852
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:08,390
opportunity for further escalation which

853
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:12,470
you know wouldn't help anyone then you

854
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:16,100
know on July 4th give or take a week

855
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,109
after not Pecha hit you know we got the

856
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,589
the usual you know persona you got to

857
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:23,390
have a persona you know as these ops go

858
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,830
and you know I was a little message

859
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,259
about you know give me a bunch of

860
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,240
Bitcoin and you know I'll make the the

861
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,100
massive decryption key available and I

862
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,259
mean this is just about you know getting

863
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,720
another free new cycle and at that point

864
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,340
they're not targeting the mainstream you

865
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,859
know the the general audience they're

866
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:44,420
targeting more the the tech sites out

867
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,880
there so to say and it's it's a free new

868
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,220
cycle for them right it allows them to

869
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,400
drive out that narrative and I think

870
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,660
most of the you know most of the news

871
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,350
organizations who cover this particular

872
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:02,350
thing again reiterated the the the issue

873
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:05,270
be of them leveraging eternal blue right

874
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:08,630
you know that that was a major part of

875
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:11,619
the the narrative around not Pecha and

876
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:16,570
you know from my personal point of view

877
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:18,740
our devices are you know continually

878
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,560
vulnerable they're not just vulnerable

879
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,379
between that window of when Microsoft

880
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,420
releases the patches a new patch you

881
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,580
know that that is not the window you

882
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:34,040
know of vulnerability to vulnerabilities

883
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:35,869
constant so you know when we look at all

884
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,710
of this right so so what does all of

885
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:41,960
this mean right what does this say about

886
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:44,990
doctrine right because that's ultimately

887
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,109
what this is when we when we when we do

888
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:52,220
apt research right and any of this stuff

889
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:55,100
this ties into you know an adversaries

890
00:41:52,220 --> 00:42:04,279
or a particular actors doctrine you know

891
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:07,040
and so so when we look at these

892
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,619
operations or IP them gusoff or or not

893
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,200
petty etc etc they're effectively an

894
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,600
embodiment of this doctrine so whatever

895
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,060
doctrine is published right whatever

896
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,220
doctor military doctrine that we see

897
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,140
published that that might you know give

898
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,660
something away about what a particular

899
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,600
nation state finds acceptable in a

900
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,540
particular domain but you know actions

901
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,670
speak louder than words

902
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:35,770
so with that particular thing in mind

903
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:39,109
right I can kind of see you can start

904
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:42,140
discerning what what a particular actor

905
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:47,720
finds acceptable behavior and this kind

906
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:50,330
of widespread you know computer network

907
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,919
attack is definitely you know it's not

908
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,560
something something different certainly

909
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,010
because again not pet your targeted

910
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,509
every user of medoc not just Ukrainian

911
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:04,970
users of médoc right so all of a sudden

912
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:06,890
all these these these companies that do

913
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,970
business with Ukraine are being drawn

914
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,500
into this conflict right so so all of a

915
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,410
sudden all these international companies

916
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,790
being drawn into that right and and and

917
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,710
they're just you know they're in

918
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,740
peacetime there's no conflict there so

919
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,840
all of a sudden they they are drawn into

920
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,459
that it raises the big

921
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,890
question alright if this is acceptable

922
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,200
behavior right or maybe it was a mistake

923
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,410
and it was all just sloppy work but if

924
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,939
this was acceptable you know what else

925
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:39,799
is acceptable and you know furthermore

926
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,470
it wasn't just legitimate military

927
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,340
targets that were being hit by not Petch

928
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:49,129
it was also civilian targets you know it

929
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:53,030
just this is just a huge no-no you know

930
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:55,160
is it no it's not cool and then the

931
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,100
other thing is you know how targeted is

932
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,899
that destructive payload going back to

933
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,779
Stuxnet right Stuxnet infected hundreds

934
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:06,140
of thousands of machines globally but

935
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,380
you know the operators made very sure to

936
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:11,960
only target very specific PLC's right

937
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:16,040
they would only ever go after PLC's in

938
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:19,100
Natanz so even though Stuxnet was found

939
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:23,200
in implants elsewhere in the world you

940
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,200
know it was quote-unquote harmless there

941
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:31,339
and I just got the 5-minute warning sign

942
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,980
so that's good this is my peltzman it's

943
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,430
slide and I hope to have time for like

944
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:40,520
one or two questions I think that you

945
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:43,609
know kind of revisiting not petia

946
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,550
one of my major takeaways was that not

947
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,200
Pecha is an on ICS threat right it's a

948
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:52,640
Windows thing right everybody talks

949
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,009
about Windows but you know most of the

950
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,129
ICS environments out there for instance

951
00:44:55,010 --> 00:45:01,340
at a port you know a shipping company

952
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:03,590
they need input right these are the ICS

953
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,090
environments are not self-contained they

954
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,810
need you know they need information

955
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,580
regards to orders etc etc etc well guess

956
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,620
what you know that information comes

957
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:16,910
from Windows machines for the most part

958
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:19,520
so we saw a non ISIS threat take down

959
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,930
all these ICS environments because again

960
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,000
if there is no data input you know

961
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:26,180
there's nothing for the ICS environment

962
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,110
to do right

963
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,750
I mean you should let that sink in for a

964
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:35,540
bit right so so did this this is a very

965
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:37,730
interesting element as well right we

966
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,370
don't need let's

967
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:42,260
Stuxnet to take down an ICS environment

968
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,650
you can just do it this way and you can

969
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,690
do it with perfect plausible deniability

970
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:51,470
right so you know you can make the

971
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:53,810
argument right like the plausible

972
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,910
deniability of well it was not an ICS

973
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,980
threat and you know it was a worm and

974
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:00,220
therefore it spread uncontrollably but

975
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,150
you know both complexity and automation

976
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:05,149
introduced deniability

977
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:11,570
so this is a you know a great advantage

978
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:14,900
for 4d for attackers and you know cici

979
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:17,090
seeing this you know become more

980
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,190
mainstream and I do believe that not

981
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,260
Petra was a template and you know a lot

982
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,180
of actors just as we saw a lot of you

983
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,050
know innovation after Stuxnet we will

984
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,839
see more innovation on this you know

985
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:31,550
multifaceted monta domain operations in

986
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,490
the foreseeable future

987
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:36,500
and that's just gonna make things more

988
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,330
complicated for everyone and I think you

989
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,670
know the the previous presenters are

990
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:44,840
kind of touching on it as well like we

991
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:47,240
we need people who understand both the

992
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,670
you know the policy side the technical

993
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:55,189
side and you know all the different

994
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:56,630
domains because right now you know that

995
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,170
the cross-domain multi-layered

996
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:02,600
information operation realm is

997
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:07,580
asymmetric warfare gold and you know the

998
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:11,390
adversary is is experienced and you know

999
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:13,759
good at it and we are not you know

1000
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:17,120
responding which only leads to further

1001
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,420
escalation and on that happy note I want

1002
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,640
to mention that we have a blog post

1003
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:26,870
coming up in the next couple days on

1004
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:29,810
doctrine doctrinal cyber on South Seas

1005
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:32,330
IO dot block I hope in like the next two

1006
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:37,210
days and with that I hope I have one

1007
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:49,470
minute left for questions thank you

1008
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:49,470
I can't see a thing after there's anyone

1009
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,369
hello thanks for the sum up of the

1010
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:59,319
events I was really confused by your

1011
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:02,290
anger about the takedown of the mail

1012
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:04,900
address because from my knowledge the

1013
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:07,210
research from kopalski showed that not

1014
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,359
petia was a Viper and didn't show any

1015
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,349
way to recover the data so by taking

1016
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:13,150
down the address

1017
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:18,130
people were prevented from useless

1018
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:20,079
payment of bitcoins that's true but at

1019
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,900
the time of takedown that wasn't known

1020
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,119
yet so and that my argument was that

1021
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,339
when we are confronted with this type of

1022
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,470
scenario our first response should not

1023
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:31,420
be to take down the email address our

1024
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:35,558
first response should be to observe and

1025
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:38,200
analyze that make sense and so risk

1026
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,000
people paying money and funding party

1027
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,290
terrorists without any chance to get

1028
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:50,170
their data so I think it's a two-sided

1029
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:51,308
search you can you know it's a different

1030
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,720
way of looking at things

1031
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:58,690
yes thank you I am I

1032
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,480
over a year ago argue that not Pecha was

1033
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:04,660
what a digital sanctions regime would

1034
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,059
look like and if you time it with the

1035
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,109
timing of sanctions imposed on Ukraine

1036
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,760
and so forth

1037
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:12,069
it would make sense but what question I

1038
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,559
have for you is how do you separate if

1039
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:16,450
you do I know that the federal

1040
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,119
government has attributed wanna cry to

1041
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,848
North Korea I'm not sure that that's

1042
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:25,690
correct but how do you separate not

1043
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:30,460
Paget from wanna cry and from dark bad

1044
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:32,740
rabbit well I mean that there's no

1045
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:36,099
public evidence right to suggest that I

1046
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:39,399
wanna cry was gee are you a bad rabbit

1047
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:41,559
does seem connected to to not petia and

1048
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,630
i think there was a little bit more

1049
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:46,599
restraint when it came to bad rabbit

1050
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:50,500
rather than not Pecha and with regards

1051
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:54,040
to the sanctions I do agree my original

1052
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,410
take on it was that you know these are

1053
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,060
economic sanctions effectively right for

1054
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:02,950
for anyone who is doing business in or

1055
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:05,350
with Ukraine and I think I have to close

1056
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,569
it down if you have any fur anyone has

1057
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,190
any questions you know find me outside

1058
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:15,489
thank you

1059
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:15,489
[Applause]
