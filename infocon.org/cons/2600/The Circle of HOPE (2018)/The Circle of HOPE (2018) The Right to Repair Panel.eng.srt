00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,060
hey thanks everybody my name is Nathan

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,399
Proctor

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,338
I am the campaign director for us Perks

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,869
right to play our campaign I'm the guy

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,230
who thinks you should be able to fix

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,090
your stuff US PIRG is a national

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,410
organization that stands up to powerful

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,820
interests whenever public health

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:27,630
democracy or our rights are threatened

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,939
and my colleague my name is gay Gordon

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,310
Byrne I am the executive director of the

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,560
repair Association we're kind of the

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,380
umbrella group that started the right to

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,370
repair legislation in states for digital

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,900
equipment and we've been at this since

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,059
2013 and we're finally getting good at

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,430
it so it's looking forward to being able

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,900
to tell you what we've been up to so

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,740
we're gonna go over a little bit about

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,220
what the right to repair legislation is

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,200
about why it's a significant thing to

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,450
fight for what are some of the problems

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,700
that we're trying to address what are

24
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,379
some of the ways in which we're making

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,970
progress and how you guys can

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,320
potentially take part and help some of

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,770
you may have seen this it's a pretty

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,389
popular poster among the iFixit crowd we

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,940
are not I fix it they are one of our

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,740
members but we really really believe in

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,530
this entire philosophy on this repair

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,060
manifesto that if you fix if you can't

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,090
fix it you don't really own it and

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,460
that's the honest truth if you can't fix

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,770
it because you can't get apart or a

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,600
manual or tool or diagnostic or firmware

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,000
there's really something fundamentally

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,429
wrong because it is legal for you to fix

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,409
your stuff it is your stuff unless

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,170
unfortunately you agree otherwise so

41
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,120
it's incredibly important that we make

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,610
sure that we retain the rights we've

43
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,159
always had we've kind of lost them over

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,289
the past 20 years incrementally and so

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,260
slowly we kind of didn't notice but I

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,690
think everybody's coming coming around

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,760
to the same philosophy that we really do

48
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,759
have to have some legislative action to

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,610
protect ourselves so if the OEM blocks

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,900
you from making a repair there's

51
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,220
something wrong with the contract

52
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,229
there's something wrong with the deal

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,480
and you've actually been swindled

54
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,279
because they have no right to tell you

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,450
what to do with your property once

56
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,590
they've sold it to you

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,049
and it's the idea that you've been

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:24,000
swindled which gives us a legislative

59
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:26,280
hook for example it is actually a matter

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,709
of antitrust that there is no

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,540
entitlement for a manufacturer to demand

62
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,519
that they alone repair your equipment

63
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,280
that would be in a legal tying agreement

64
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,940
under antitrust law going back to 1898

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,739
the problem we have is that the US

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,900
Department of Justice really wasn't set

67
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,120
up for the digital world and not with

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,519
thousands of manufacturers all doing the

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,849
same thing at the same time they are set

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,180
up to go after bad manufacturers that

71
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,369
have 60% market share one at a time that

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,290
doesn't work in this world Apple is a

73
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,780
huge manufacturer but there's thirty

74
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,548
percent market share how do we go after

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,010
Apple well the DOJ we've met with the

76
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,390
DOJ and they were very sympathetic they

77
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,099
understood what the problems were and

78
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,440
they said flatly you need to go

79
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,310
legislative which was not originally

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,760
good news but we did figure it out what

81
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,489
we came up with is using state law to

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,560
control what people are required to do

83
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,359
in order to do business in that state

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,000
and the requirements are really simple

85
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,579
and they are the same exact requirements

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,420
that everybody needs to be able to build

87
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,519
a business doing repair if you can work

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,559
your way around not having tools work

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,389
your way around not having Diagnostics

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,130
be able to hack and fix the firmware

91
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,170
those are all possibilities but you

92
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,450
can't build a business on it if you

93
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,480
can't know that you can buy parts get

94
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,578
manuals tools documentation diagnostics

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
and firmware you can't make a business

96
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:57,030
so that's the angle that we've taken in

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,920
the states anybody that wants to get in

98
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,049
the business repairing anything needs

99
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,369
access to all of this and they need to

100
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,709
make sure that it's fair and reasonable

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,139
as well so that like might when my

102
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,989
husband spilled coffee on his car that

103
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,060
the the chip that got wet wasn't six

104
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,919
hundred dollars that's what he got

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,560
charged because there was no options

106
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,900
that's not fair or reasonable my

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,630
microwave oven had a touchpad about this

108
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,989
big touchpad didn't work anyway anymore

109
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,090
and GE decided that that touchpad was

110
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,950
worth $600 now the whole microwave

111
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,229
wasn't worth $600

112
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,460
so I participated in in grotesque

113
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,470
abusive e-waste

114
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,060
by throwing away a microwave and buying

115
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,920
a brand new one for a hundred and

116
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,550
seventy nine dollars and going into GE

117
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,490
so this is the problem that we all

118
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,050
experience with technology parts and we

119
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,030
didn't experience so much with

120
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,750
mechanical parts because you could go

121
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:54,179
theoretically mill something that would

122
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,330
fit so once you start bringing in a chip

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,890
and the Diagnostics and the embedded

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,960
software on a chip that's where the

125
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,440
opportunity for monopolization really

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,419
comes in so I use this as a five legged

127
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,180
stool because the five legged stool is

128
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,210
very stable and you lose one of those

129
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,880
legs and you're unstable so right to

130
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,150
repair is basically covering all of what

131
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,190
you must have to make a repair

132
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,000
commercially without having to dodge the

133
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,670
law and we do this in legislation it's

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,460
about a one-sentence bill it says you

135
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,020
have to manufacture provides you know

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,820
the manuals two parts the tools the

137
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,919
firmware the Diagnostics they can sell

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,260
the parts and tools that everything else

139
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,680
is free whatever it is that they provide

140
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,480
to their repair community there are

141
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,490
their subcontractors or their direct

142
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,240
employees is exactly what they have to

143
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,820
make available so it works pretty well

144
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,580
and it actually has some pretty good

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,440
history with it what and Nathan who

146
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,150
lived in Massachusetts the first state

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,180
that actually did a right to repair bill

148
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,429
can explain how this all went down but

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,100
imagine if you are here in New York and

150
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,680
New York passes right to repair we are

151
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,050
real close this year by the way if you

152
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,150
lived in New Jersey or Connecticut would

153
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,640
you be upset by that no you would drive

154
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,289
to New York and get your stuff fixed and

155
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,700
turn around and go home the same thing

156
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,620
would happen in any other adjoining

157
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,320
state or any place where you could

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,350
travel and parts would would travel at

159
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,900
the speed of FedEx or overnight service

160
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,610
and information travels at the speed of

161
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,500
the Internet so once it's unlocked it's

162
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,700
almost always unlocked for the whole

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,500
country and that's why manufacturers are

164
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,440
fighting us so terribly hard because

165
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,210
they know that's one and done what

166
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,660
happened with the auto industry is that

167
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,820
mad

168
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,490
to chuse 'it's passed a bill but there

169
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,219
was 12 or 13 other states with slightly

170
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,990
different bills and you can imagine how

171
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,360
difficult that would be for Ford and

172
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,520
Mercedes and everybody else to have 50

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,800
potential different versions of what

174
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,900
they had to provide so that industry got

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
together and agreed to write to repair

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,520
and this is exactly that what we're

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,800
trying to do and Nathan can talk more

178
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,710
about that particular effort right so in

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,710
2012 there was a ballot measure that

180
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,169
went before the voters of Massachusetts

181
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,539
which would give most of auto ride

182
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,890
repair it actually doesn't include all

183
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,820
five legs of the stool it didn't include

184
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,380
parts which occasionally is problematic

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,940
for people in Massachusetts or people

186
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,920
everywhere I guess Massachusetts voters

187
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,250
passed the ballot measure 86 to 14

188
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,050
that's like a six to one margin that's

189
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,740
that's pretty much unanimous when it

190
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,120
comes to these things and then pretty

191
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,160
soon automakers

192
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,980
took that framework that was in

193
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,230
Massachusetts and made a national

194
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,410
agreement across the auto manufacturers

195
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,880
that they would begin to provide the

196
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,450
manuals and diagnostics that they

197
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,680
weren't providing and and and under this

198
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,620
agreement we can mostly still use

199
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,000
independent Auto Mechanics for most of

200
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,610
the stuff that goes wrong with our car

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,880
the not having parts is a problem

202
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,360
especially for certain highly

203
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,550
computerized parts within a car but I

204
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,650
think this showed us two things one was

205
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,750
that there was a framework that you

206
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,570
could require companies to give you the

207
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,080
stuff that we need to fix our property

208
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,750
and that it would work legally you know

209
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,120
in out in the wild and that if you

210
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,020
passed it in one state it could become

211
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,070
something that would affect every state

212
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,870
and next I kind of want to talk a little

213
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,190
bit about what is the story behind the

214
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,380
you know what are the values and the

215
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,370
worldview that kind of go behind the

216
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:50,970
story so Jay and I have the wonderful

217
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,280
pleasure of going toe-to-toe with the

218
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,050
most profitable companies in the history

219
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,600
of the world and trying to convince

220
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,689
lawmakers that we're reasonable and that

221
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,430
they're unreasonable and I think it

222
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,010
helps a lot if you can kind of convey

223
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,180
the two different worldviews that kind

224
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,430
of come into conflict with this

225
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,370
legislation one would say that you don't

226
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,920
really own your stuff you're you are a

227
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,560
licensed user you know when you buy

228
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,620
something it's not yours you you kind of

229
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,800
use it under a service end user license

230
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,089
agreement with the OEM the manufacturer

231
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,250
we're gonna say OEM instead of

232
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,130
manufacturer because it's faster om

233
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,260
Original Equipment Manufacturer

234
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,610
you use it kind of in whatever you use

235
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,990
your property it's not really yours

236
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,050
you're a licensed user you use it in

237
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,350
whatever way meat makes the OEMs

238
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,439
shareholders happy they support it that

239
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,790
you use it at they're you know when in

240
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,029
ways that they want and they have

241
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,149
control and our version of that story is

242
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,320
when you buy something you own it you

243
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,930
can do whatever you want with it

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,339
you could take it apart you can fix it

245
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,649
if you want you I mean it's your it's

246
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:08,230
your property they have no say in how

247
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:12,160
you use your stuff we we want repairs

248
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,500
handled by as many people as possible in

249
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,360
in this world right we want to take the

250
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,720
tools of our technology and we want to

251
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,270
put them in as mode most democratic

252
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,040
environment as we can possibly manage so

253
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,410
that everyone has access to these tools

254
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,680
to solve whatever problems they define

255
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,899
for themselves and on the other side

256
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,899
manufacturers want to completely control

257
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:37,480
the tool protecting it with intellectual

258
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:40,510
property law and huge end-user license

259
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,970
agreements and my colleague Jay has

260
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,160
coined this term which I love called the

261
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,800
circular monopoly they're trying to

262
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,390
achieve you know we talked about the

263
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,099
circular economy which is this idea that

264
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,769
we can create an economy that doesn't

265
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,680
just extract and waste but you know

266
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,890
creates a circle where we recycle reuse

267
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,370
repurpose and take those raw materials

268
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,300
back into the product stream what

269
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,610
they're trying to do is essentially

270
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,979
create a universal like a circular

271
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,890
monopoly of control over the entire life

272
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,410
cycle of a Prada

273
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,689
and so these are the categories I we

274
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,870
have I think that kind of underlie these

275
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,519
arguments we have with these lobbyists

276
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,220
when we go in you know there should they

277
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,500
try to convince lawmakers that you know

278
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,850
if people are allowed to use their stuff

279
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,620
in whatever way they want you know

280
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,529
they'll hurt themselves and there'll be

281
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,730
all kinds of security problems and you

282
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,380
know it'll be dangerous and they'll sue

283
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,790
these companies and these companies are

284
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,790
really worried about being sued by

285
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:42,290
somebody misusing their toaster and but

286
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,880
we've also started to see a number of

287
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,430
problems which I thought we would talk a

288
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,920
little bit about some of the ways in

289
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,380
which companies treatments of their

290
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,029
products as completely proprietary is

291
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,019
just interfering with people's daily

292
00:11:53,029 --> 00:12:00,829
lives so one of the first kind of poster

293
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,329
children are like case that really kind

294
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:05,180
of brought right to repair to the

295
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,880
national attention was farmers and turns

296
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,870
out that john deere puts software locks

297
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,910
on their tractors so that software needs

298
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,089
to like confirm the installation of a

299
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,829
new part if you get the tractor

300
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,779
equivalent of a check engine light it'll

301
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:24,399
essentially deactivate the device and

302
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:27,439
won't let you use it until a certified

303
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,890
john deere technician plugs a computer

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,890
up to it and punches in a code there was

305
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:40,610
a fantastic motherboard documentary

306
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:42,230
which can we get sound on this if you

307
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,940
look up track you're hacking and

308
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,720
motherboard you can watch this it's like

309
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,720
a 12-minute documentary that they did i

310
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
apologize

311
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:58,729
yeah so do you wanna go ahead batteries

312
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,910
so one problem is as we go saw from that

313
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,199
documentary john deere farmer or farmers

314
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,769
using John Deere equipment essentially

315
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:09,290
hired Ukrainian hackers to crack john

316
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,420
deere diagnostic software so that they

317
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:17,240
could actually plant and harvest their

318
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:19,729
crops and john deere tried to stop them

319
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,180
and the librarian of congress ruled that

320
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:27,740
they had a right illegal right to

321
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,229
pack their own tractors which is a nice

322
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,400
win for us but then almost immediately

323
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,190
John Deere changed their end-user

324
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:41,750
license agreements to expressly forbid

325
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:44,960
any software modification if you look up

326
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,360
tractor hacking and motherboard there's

327
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,820
a documentary on it was on motherboard

328
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,360
which is a vice technology channel it's

329
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,440
fabulous

330
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,050
anyway and maybe maybe the hacked

331
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,240
maybe the Ukrainian hacker hired to

332
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:07,099
break those tractors in his in his room

333
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,260
another thing that we see is that you

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,390
know OEMs are in the business of forcing

335
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,150
you to buy new stuff that's how they

336
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,890
make their money they're not really in

337
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,750
the repair business they don't really

338
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,030
have the interests of the user at heart

339
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,280
and another problem that comes from this

340
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,030
system is they literally cannot fix

341
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,370
problems they have with their devices so

342
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,870
one of many Apple device problems I

343
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,090
could probably lose about 6 Apple device

344
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,660
problems but this one was kind of

345
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,540
notorious in December Apple slowed down

346
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,520
their phones they slowed down the phones

347
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,620
if it detected the battery on the device

348
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,280
was older and was running at a lower

349
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,870
capacity this was this happened like in

350
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,339
December like right before Christmas

351
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,530
right as they had a poorly performing

352
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,340
new phone that came out it's kind of

353
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,740
funny how that happened and some you

354
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,030
know some technicians figured out what

355
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,090
was going on they were throttling the

356
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,650
processor on the phone an apple then

357
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,690
admitted that they were doing it and

358
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,199
said they were doing it to address you

359
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,690
know battery drain issues or whatever

360
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,420
they said you know different performance

361
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,830
issues and so they offered a $29 battery

362
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,020
replacement which is a greatly reduced

363
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,420
price if you take your phone to the

364
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,970
iPhone to get the battery fixed and of

365
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,979
course they quickly had like four or

366
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,720
five month long waiting lists to swap

367
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,580
out batteries of their phones and we did

368
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,460
a little like off-the-cuff calculation

369
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,620
and found that you know apples like

370
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,380
40-something thousand

371
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,480
like Apple store employees this is not

372
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,520
they're not even technicians is just all

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,220
their employees if they did nothing but

374
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,130
swap batteries out on iPhone 5s and

375
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,360
sixes in assuming it takes them 15 to 20

376
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,070
minutes to do that

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,960
it would take those 40,000 people

378
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,760
something like five or six years of

379
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,970
doing nothing but continually swapping

380
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,550
batteries to address the you know 100

381
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,980
million iPhones that are in use and they

382
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,479
they they cannot fix the problems that

383
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,760
they make with their devices and they

384
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,580
won't let anyone else fix it and the

385
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,069
result is we have this enormous

386
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,320
electronic waste problem Americans

387
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,710
throughout four hundred sixteen thousand

388
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,240
smartphones every day one third of the

389
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,620
world does not have access to that

390
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,780
technology I mean this is an absurd

391
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,630
problem to have in the world we're

392
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,100
throwing out usable stuff because the

393
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,710
companies that make it won't let

394
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,320
somebody else fix it and reuse it for

395
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:38,450
something that's not exactly the purpose

396
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,500
that they intended yeah and now we're

397
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,010
gonna again talk a little bit about

398
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,310
what's legal and illegal yep and there's

399
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,460
we've been told for a long time that

400
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,589
repair is illegal in a lot of subtle

401
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,130
ways and that there or that it's a

402
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:57,430
blurred line between legal and legal and

403
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:01,280
illegal and there really is no blur

404
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:04,040
repair is fully legal it is your

405
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,649
property you are allowed to do anything

406
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,470
you want with your property what you

407
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,750
can't do legally is copy software and

408
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:15,470
sell it and that's a very clear

409
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:19,160
definition so a lot of what we think has

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,870
gone wrong with it's the the problem is

411
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,170
that basically people are telling lies

412
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,790
that become true by repetition not true

413
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,290
because they're true just true because

414
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:31,280
we hear it so often we think it must be

415
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,500
true so when we're getting into problems

416
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,610
of who owns what and who's responsible

417
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,660
for what for example if you somehow

418
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,389
electrocuted yourself while fixing an

419
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,050
iphone does that harm Apple and the

420
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,940
answer is absolutely not the Apple the

421
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,299
only way that Apple could be harmed as

422
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,029
if they

423
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,429
made a defective product at the outset

424
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,379
and if their product isn't defective and

425
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:56,509
you were just somehow I don't know how

426
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:59,360
you do with low voltage but if you hurt

427
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:01,940
yourself on a phone it's your problem

428
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,008
Apple says in their contract it's your

429
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,070
problem they have nothing to do with

430
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:09,409
your problem it's your medical bills

431
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,389
it's your insurance but they somehow

432
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:13,909
want to say that they're responsible but

433
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:16,219
they aren't so when it comes to

434
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:18,619
liability they really have to have done

435
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,600
something wrong in which case I think

436
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,779
they have a much larger problem than you

437
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,350
personally think Takata airbags versus

438
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:29,269
cuts from glass on cell phones so the

439
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,570
legal lines are really not nearly as

440
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,730
difficult to discern when it comes to

441
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,559
doing legislation there's really two

442
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,320
bodies of law that we have a choice of

443
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,139
and one is to work at the state level or

444
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,799
at the federal level and it lines up

445
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:46,850
very easily in the state world general

446
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,369
business law

447
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,539
which covers all of your transactions

448
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,369
all of your ownership

449
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,259
you know licensing all of those

450
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:55,759
transactions are done at the state level

451
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:59,350
I should have said licensing take that

452
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:02,359
word back any time you buy something

453
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,009
title insurance you know Uniform

454
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,158
Commercial Code all of those things are

455
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,029
part of state law and if those

456
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,909
transactions are unfair and deceptive

457
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:13,039
states have the right to say you can't

458
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:16,190
work in this state on the completely

459
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,350
other side is federal law there's no

460
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,619
place in federal law that says you have

461
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,738
to provide parts and copyright law is

462
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,908
not where that mandate could come so

463
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:28,429
even though we need to work with

464
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,759
copyright law because of the tremendous

465
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,950
harm being done by DRM and section 1201

466
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,220
it's really a totally different process

467
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,749
and I use it as like the 80/20 rule

468
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,519
without 80 percent of our physical

469
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:42,859
problems with repair or resolved very

470
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,899
right to repair in States the other 20%

471
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:47,539
of problems are really copyright

472
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:50,238
problems and those have to be dealt with

473
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,980
federally and they both have to happen

474
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:55,309
but they don't have to happen in any

475
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,799
order so that's why we're working both

476
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:58,999
places we have a lot we do a lot of work

477
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,900
with the Electronic Frontier Foundation

478
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,910
we

479
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,360
very involved with all of these DMCA

480
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:09,380
hearings going back to 2012 15 we're now

481
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,790
in the 2018 cycle it's very important

482
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,590
that we're out there and that we have

483
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,680
our faces in the Copyright Office

484
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,320
because prior to 2012 we weren't there

485
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,000
the repair industry was not there and

486
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,250
all of these rules were being written

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,140
that impacted us and we weren't there so

488
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,180
the entire entertainment software

489
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,630
industry was writing copyright law with

490
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,970
no pushback so thank goodness we're

491
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,640
finally there there are two major

492
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,160
studies that if you're interested in

493
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,900
copyright law I think they're really

494
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,120
really well worth reading they're not

495
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,700
you you do have to read the footnotes

496
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,000
and they're kind of long but these

497
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,020
studies were instigated by us especially

498
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,880
over tractors that to lead senators

499
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,889
senator Grassley and Lee he the majority

500
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,740
leader and the rancor in the department

501
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,350
the Judiciary Committee wanted these

502
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,620
studies and they came back studying the

503
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:06,129
impact of embedded software on matters

504
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,449
of ordinary equipment repair such as

505
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,850
tractors refrigerators and cellphones

506
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,710
and the study came back saying hey

507
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,530
copyright law is just fine we've already

508
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,750
made provision in the copyright law for

509
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,510
repair it is legal to backup and restore

510
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,970
your software for purposes of repair it

511
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,030
is legal to research your software for

512
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,640
security holes it is legal to make

513
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:31,580
modifications to customize that software

514
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,680
for your personal use but you still

515
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,139
don't get to sell somebody else's

516
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,390
software other than that they said a

517
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,830
copyright law is perfectly fine we were

518
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,960
disappointed because we really wanted to

519
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,300
make a stronger statement but they did

520
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,670
they did it in a second study that came

521
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,940
out in just just about a year ago in

522
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,340
2017 in the in June where they studied

523
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,180
the impact of DRM digital rights

524
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,730
management aka section 1201 and what

525
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,210
they came back was is that yeah we agree

526
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,010
with you that DRM is blocking legal

527
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,050
repair and maintenance for way more

528
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,890
products than we ever dreamt it's not

529
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,450
well worded it should be changed and we

530
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,400
would like Congress this is their

531
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,350
recommendation to Congress to

532
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,630
provide them with enabling legislation

533
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:23,149
that allows for legal repair takes legal

534
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,100
repair and maintenance off of the

535
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,590
Copyright Office with the exception of

536
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,750
computer games so the Copyright Office

537
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,649
is still convinced that 14 year-olds are

538
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,809
out there copying computer games this

539
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,210
audience knows how true or true or not

540
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,980
true that is but if that's the price of

541
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,160
getting DRM off the backs of repair I

542
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,900
think it would be a good price to pay

543
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,179
and then when we come back to contracts

544
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,100
which is the state side we've got to

545
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:52,280
remind everybody the manufacturer owns

546
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,830
something they sell it to you and then

547
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,230
you own it they no longer own it they

548
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,840
don't have the right to tell you what to

549
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,120
do with it and the contract itself says

550
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,250
exactly that every contract ever written

551
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,219
and I spent 40 years in commercial

552
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:10,160
contracts says this and every contract

553
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,230
ever written says and by the way we are

554
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,510
not responsible for things that you do

555
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,490
yourself we're not responsible for if

556
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,320
our equipment is down in your tractor

557
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,210
isn't working because it's our fault you

558
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,990
we're still not responsible for lots of

559
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,520
crops your maximum damages are always

560
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,650
limited to the cost you paid for the

561
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,530
equipment and the only thing they can't

562
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,300
disclaim is a legal term called gross

563
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,480
negligence which means that they really

564
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:38,000
did something wrong so it is not true

565
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,830
that you can hurt the manufacturer as I

566
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,590
said before by electrocuting yourself

567
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,428
I had a neighbor this very sad story

568
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,580
owned a little nursery garden store and

569
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:52,160
he drove over his adult son killed him

570
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,740
was John Deere responsible heck no

571
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,420
so these are the kinds of things we seem

572
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,250
to have lost our minds about when it

573
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,870
comes to technology thinking that

574
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,570
somehow technology is different than

575
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,969
other products but it is not and the way

576
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,309
that the contract should be laid out is

577
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,020
that the contract needs to be a complete

578
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,780
agreement you bought it it's yours

579
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,389
manufacturer has no say in what happens

580
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,550
afterward but they're sneaking in these

581
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,559
little side agreements they're not

582
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,030
supposed to be side agreements they're

583
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,830
supposed to be complete agreements so

584
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,710
every time you have a contract that says

585
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,730
there is a reference to an Associated

586
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,679
license or a

587
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,390
an embedded license or some kind of

588
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,120
end-user License Agreement that is not

589
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,860
even good contract law those licenses

590
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,830
are supposed to be totally separate

591
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:40,139
which gets us back to monopoly they're

592
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,629
not supposed to be requiring you to buy

593
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,460
a license to use the equipment so the

594
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,700
legal foundation for right to repair is

595
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,200
extremely solid and the one thing I

596
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,059
think you guys could appreciate more

597
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,280
than most of the people that I speak

598
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,740
with is the role of firmware and who's

599
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,090
supporting the firmware legislators we

600
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,830
never talk about this stuff because

601
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:03,689
there's their minds have already been

602
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:05,730
blown but if you own it and the firmware

603
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,200
is part of the hardware which it really

604
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,419
was throughout most of our lives it

605
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,450
transfers the firmware came with it it's

606
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,950
inseparable from it and you can you can

607
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,330
do whatever you want to it I mean half

608
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,700
of the software industry that we know

609
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,899
today was based on people tinkering with

610
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,270
the software that came with their

611
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,710
original computers we wouldn't have half

612
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,679
the products we had if there hadn't been

613
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,120
people playing with it so that's part of

614
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,100
their rights as equipment owners to

615
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,590
tinker with the firmware but if the

616
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,740
manufacturer decides the firmware should

617
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,500
be licensed then ownership is completely

618
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,299
off the table you if there's one line of

619
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,890
code in that firmware that the

620
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,570
manufacturer says is mine its

621
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,790
proprietary and you can't touch it and

622
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,980
here's the license then you own nothing

623
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,480
you could spend a million dollars for a

624
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,429
machine and if it's controlled by a

625
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,790
firmware license you basically own

626
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:59,220
nothing and that's the Sham of it that's

627
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,290
the farce that we're trying to try to

628
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,020
get people to understand that you have

629
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,820
to have one or the other you can't have

630
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,500
a contract that says I'm selling you

631
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,049
this one I'm also controlling it that

632
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,690
that isn't that doesn't exist legally

633
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:16,379
there's no we either own things where we

634
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,690
license them there is no merged system

635
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,940
so when manufacturers tell us that this

636
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,100
equipment is way to technology

637
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,110
technologically sophisticated for us to

638
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,230
allow you to repair it they're really

639
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:31,199
whistling Dixie because it can't be that

640
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,630
way if they think it's that way then

641
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,220
there's something wrong and there's

642
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,190
unfortunately quite a lot of them that

643
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,640
actually believe their own believe what

644
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,640
they're saying

645
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,759
but for anybody that doesn't know what

646
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:49,209
that means it means fear uncertainty in

647
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,370
doubt when we're meeting with

648
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,169
legislators we know in advance because

649
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,299
we've been down this path many times

650
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,269
that the manufacturing community

651
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,559
absolutely hates right to repair but

652
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:01,419
they don't have a leg to stand on

653
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,490
legally they don't have any principles

654
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,159
to stand on so they start making stuff

655
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:09,159
up the first three flavors are pretty

656
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,600
simple they all say all right we're

657
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,389
gonna our copyrights are going to be

658
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,879
infringed and of course not it's legal

659
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:17,769
to backup and restore software and so we

660
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:19,809
point out copyright law then they say oh

661
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:24,250
my patents my patents and neglecting to

662
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,600
mention that patents are public little

663
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,820
problem there and then you start crying

664
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,519
about trade secrets well the interesting

665
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,799
part about trade secrets is that if you

666
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:36,250
publish repair documentation and you

667
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,460
distribute it to anybody it's no longer

668
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,860
secret so you can't make that claim and

669
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,139
distribute repair documentation to a

670
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,570
field engineering force so that's off

671
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:48,549
the table then then they start crying

672
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,100
about safety I went over that before

673
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,750
they say it's not our problem and then

674
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,519
they want the problem back only when it

675
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,019
suits them to prevent you from repairing

676
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,779
your equipment that's slightly

677
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:00,460
hypocritical and then this this last one

678
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:04,090
has cropped up rather recently it would

679
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,620
be the security farce we had the first

680
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,168
this showed up about a year and a half

681
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,389
ago in Nebraska where Apple came in and

682
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,669
met with the senator that who was her

683
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:15,549
bill and told her flat out that if she

684
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:19,539
passed this bill Nebraska was going to

685
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:24,580
become a mecca for hackers and see we

686
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:26,919
laugh - good good excellent then you

687
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,779
know that nobody into breasts that

688
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,940
there's no bulgarian hackers that are

689
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:33,789
waiting to buy tickets to Omaha just so

690
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,000
they can go hack in Nebraska but this is

691
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,259
a problem of education legislators do

692
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,139
not understand the first thing about

693
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:43,299
cybersecurity and therefore they are

694
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,399
terrified by even the word cyber

695
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:48,639
security and all apples been able all

696
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:52,120
Apple has had to do is say it's insecure

697
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,860
and then they believe it so one of the

698
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,129
things I will

699
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,959
like to have your help with is when it

700
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,250
comes time to meet with legislators we

701
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,080
could sure use some people that know

702
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,360
what they're talking about to come in

703
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,030
and sit down and say hey I do this for a

704
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,969
living not that guy isn't know what he's

705
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,460
talking about it's not you know no I

706
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,040
mean I mean no I meant philosophically

707
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,120
you know lobbyists don't know what

708
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,070
they're talking about either they're

709
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,919
beholden to whatever they're told by

710
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,510
their employer so we do need some help

711
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,190
with that and then I put the little

712
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,830
sprinkles on top because there are

713
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,440
various other kinds of silly things that

714
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,590
they say such as we spend a lot of money

715
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,880
on training I'm like okay you spend a

716
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,799
lot of money on training able so does

717
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,130
the other guy these are all cost of

718
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,629
doing business the dealership Trejo we

719
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,290
spent a lot of money on our franchise

720
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,150
fees I'm like okay that's not my problem

721
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,610
is an independent repair shop I've got

722
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,440
my own business costs so some of these

723
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,840
things are pretty simple the silly and

724
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,650
easy to debate but that security one is

725
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,049
really quite a problem and that's where

726
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,549
I'm gonna pass it back over to Nathan I

727
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:01,440
wanted to tell one story about the

728
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:04,260
security stuff because they they clearly

729
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,500
honed this argument and was that New

730
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,990
Hampshire hearing that they really kind

731
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,980
of debuted they had a whole new trade

732
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:17,760
association that was advocating for the

733
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:22,200
security of our things this is gonna be

734
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,549
funny for you guys and yeah and they had

735
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,980
these lobbyists who knew nothing about

736
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,418
technology testifying about so one of my

737
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,110
favorite ones was there was a company

738
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:33,330
who made like these little Internet of

739
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,000
Things cameras that you could put to

740
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,189
like monitor your house and they they

741
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,080
came to the hearing and they said you

742
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,929
know if someone repairs this that's a

743
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,270
serious security violation and I really

744
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,700
had wished I had the guts to go up and

745
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,500
say like hey you so you know guys know

746
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,160
when you install these cameras in your

747
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,780
house which you should never ever do

748
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,660
someone somewhere in the world can look

749
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,410
at those images within half an hour and

750
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:04,500
I mean the idea that the guy fixing the

751
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,240
battery problem in the webcam is the

752
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,890
real security fault and not

753
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,270
the fact that these companies are making

754
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:14,160
these unbelievably insecure devices but

755
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,760
that they spent all this time arguing

756
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,930
about security when it comes to repair I

757
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,330
don't know they somebody needs to pop

758
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:24,510
this bubble because it really works

759
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,909
legislators are really afraid of you

760
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:30,270
know being held you holding the bag for

761
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,670
you know some kind of hacking of you

762
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,960
know nanny cams or whatever but let's

763
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,940
just talk a little bit about the three

764
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,740
fronts right now and the the work that

765
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,800
we're doing right now to advance right

766
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,870
to repair so the first is that and the

767
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,860
the obviously the biggest focus of you

768
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,560
know the work that we're doing together

769
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,639
is to pass right to repair legislation

770
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:53,010
in the states and in 2018 we've had 18

771
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,100
active bills across the country on right

772
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,470
to repair which is up from five in 2017

773
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,480
as Gaye said we passed he said three

774
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,700
committees he passed three committees I

775
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,020
guess it was okay the past there's a we

776
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,510
first year we passed committee passed it

777
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,460
in three different states we had a

778
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,020
number of bills pulled from the

779
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,930
committee by leadership because the

780
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,790
committee was about to pass them and we

781
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,780
were very close to getting a full

782
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:20,430
Assembly vote in the state of New York

783
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,899
this year and I think that we're

784
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,150
definitely getting closer and closer and

785
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,640
closer on this we will have more states

786
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:29,520
that introduced this bill of 2019 New

787
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,110
Jersey's still active so Jersey folks in

788
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,810
the room you guys should get connected

789
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:36,570
with repair org and and help us win

790
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:39,659
right repair this year in New Jersey you

791
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,159
know we're seeing a lot of growth with

792
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,530
just increased cooperation and

793
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,750
sophistication of our campaign you know

794
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,310
my job at us burgers burgers the

795
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,410
federation of state advocacy

796
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:52,470
organizations and so we're helping to

797
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:56,160
just create strong effective coalition's

798
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,170
in all these states that can really make

799
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,250
it difficult for Apple and the other

800
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:05,270
OEMs who want to stop us to fight us in

801
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:08,340
all these places at once

802
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,280
oops yeah and then the front number two

803
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,949
would be that we also like a said the

804
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,990
80/20 rule we also need to write

805
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,000
copyright law that makes sense

806
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,130
there's two things one we need to

807
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,480
rewrite the DMCA so that it's not a

808
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:29,350
horrible travesty and then we can one of

809
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:33,100
the short-term things we can do is add

810
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:36,850
more more devices and more uses to the

811
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,699
exemptions of section 1201 so for

812
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,629
example farmers can now hack their

813
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,000
tractors and it's not a violation of

814
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:49,570
that DMCA for them to do that because

815
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,010
they have a specific exemption from the

816
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,149
librarian of congress that's cory

817
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,649
doctorow and kyle weans

818
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:58,090
in in april in los angeles testifying

819
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:59,850
about some of the telematics and some of

820
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,928
the different systems in automobiles

821
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,600
which we're trying to get access to

822
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:08,139
repair which are currently behind kind

823
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,569
of these digital barriers and then write

824
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,129
repair was also critical in cell phone

825
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,899
unlocking so that gay was there for that

826
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,409
so that maybe yep yep two seconds on

827
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:20,069
that yeah when just around the time we

828
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:25,869
were getting our coalition put together

829
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:28,810
the 2012 version of the DMCA came out

830
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:31,869
and had previously had allowed unlocking

831
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,210
and then removed unlocking and it was

832
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,589
enough of an uproar that kyle Wiens and

833
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,099
some of the rest of our board members

834
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:43,060
who became our board members were able

835
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:45,460
to get 114,000 petition signatures in

836
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,849
like a month it flooded the white house

837
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,730
with record with say i want to unlock my

838
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:56,940
phone so by 2014 there they got to build

839
00:34:51,730 --> 00:35:00,460
on which in 18 months in congress is

840
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,290
apparently almost a record in terms of

841
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,760
getting a bill passed i thought it was

842
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,310
horrible and they told me home my man

843
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,930
that's the fastest I've ever seen so it

844
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:12,580
is possible when you get enough people

845
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:15,098
involved to get bills done we've had

846
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,950
over 70,000 people write their

847
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:21,250
legislators through our widget which is

848
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,319
on our website so if anybody is so

849
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,810
inclined to try to get a bill started in

850
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,390
their state just go on our website you

851
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,980
find the state logo and write a letter

852
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,529
make phone call schedule a meeting it's

853
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,210
that easy

854
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,150
we had a bill in Washington State based

855
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,490
on one meeting one person one meeting

856
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:41,030
and that bill almost went all the way

857
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:43,549
through so individuals make a huge

858
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,110
difference in this business and then I

859
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,190
think the third front that we have to

860
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:50,660
consider this fight against is this

861
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,940
throwaway mentality that we've allowed

862
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,450
to develop right so we want to build an

863
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,400
economy in a system where people can fix

864
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,680
problems and they have the expectation

865
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,360
that they can they can and should fix

866
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,089
their stuff but first it needs to be

867
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,250
possible so first we need to pass laws

868
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,900
that allow people to to make it even

869
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,930
possible to fix their stuff and then we

870
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,280
need to kind of create repairability

871
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,890
serviceability as criteria for doing

872
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,650
business and for buying things for

873
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,870
individuals and governments and then we

874
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,200
just need that we need to build in the

875
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:26,690
value of you know kind of sustaining our

876
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,480
stuff and taking ownership over the

877
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,730
things that we have and and companies

878
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,680
gain a lot from us just continuing to

879
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,330
just think of everything that we have as

880
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,660
disposable and we can always just get

881
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,740
another one at Walmart but as we know

882
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,759
there's a lot of problems associated

883
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:46,100
with that and so quickly just before we

884
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,900
end the question so if you want if how

885
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,290
you can help a set if you want to go to

886
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,030
repair org and take action send a note

887
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,170
to your state legislators or get

888
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,050
connected with other people in your

889
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,670
state working on this stuff we are

890
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,430
actively looking for people to help us

891
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:04,280
point out how silly these arguments the

892
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,690
industry has about security are and you

893
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,790
know you should definitely contact us if

894
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,370
you're willing to kind of help us put

895
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,560
together some materials for that if you

896
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,810
contact us PIRG I can connect you with

897
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,330
the actions and things going on in your

898
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,970
state and then also you could always

899
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,880
support organizations like repair Oregon

900
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,709
US PIRG you know we're scrappy member

901
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,200
funded organizations going to toe to toe

902
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,970
with I know we I looked at the numbers

903
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,890
from New York and the total market

904
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:36,379
capitalization of companies lobbying

905
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:40,089
against us was 2.5 trillion dollars yeah

906
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,859
I will go into questions

907
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:47,619
we have five minutes for questions and I

908
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:52,538
can't see anybody so yell hello yeah

909
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:54,369
hello yeah so the car companies have a

910
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,749
lot of complex firmware and software in

911
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:58,719
the systems and it's increasing

912
00:37:55,749 --> 00:38:01,808
significantly over time and computer

913
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:04,420
companies and software manufacturers and

914
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:06,249
telephone companies and so on have put

915
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,349
into place over time we will no longer

916
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:12,038
support we're no longer supporting this

917
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:14,079
this system after this date so I see

918
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,160
cars heading in the same direction and I

919
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,660
was wondering how we could get ahead of

920
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,219
that because at some point people will

921
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,618
have a car that's a brick because they

922
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:22,920
can't fix it because the car companies

923
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,910
will say we no longer support this and

924
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,539
presumably we're not making available

925
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:31,689
the underlying firmware software

926
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:34,809
information what the underlying firmware

927
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:37,689
is available and one of the problems is

928
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:39,789
is that the certain parts are not

929
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:42,609
available so that if you have certain

930
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:45,640
electronic components within a car that

931
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:47,410
you know runs you know like are

932
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,538
necessary to the operation of the car

933
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:53,170
but are kind of impossible to replicate

934
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:54,999
generically that's why gay talk about

935
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,349
the five legged stool you need all five

936
00:38:54,999 --> 00:39:03,549
things to really break the you know the

937
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:06,819
monopoly of repair I mean we have

938
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:08,890
another like servicing all the things

939
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:11,349
and all the software in the world it's

940
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,969
kind of another related problem but if

941
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,239
you could at least reset it to the

942
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:18,729
working order that it came with that

943
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:22,539
would allow most stuff to keep working

944
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:25,598
yeah and add that access to firmware and

945
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:28,239
the legal authority to hack it which is

946
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,759
what in most of these situations the

947
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,459
u.s. the Copyright Office has granted

948
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:37,329
will allow for people to support

949
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:39,459
equipment that has been dropped it mean

950
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,140
it may not be as widespread as say a

951
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:43,479
Linux operating system you know

952
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,999
supported by Red Hat but the opportunity

953
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:47,828
will then be available right now it's

954
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:50,319
prohibited because nobody can get the

955
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:54,609
information it's all you know super

956
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:56,589
secret sauce what which it isn't

957
00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:00,700
so I think right to repair will help

958
00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:02,680
break that situation down legislatively

959
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,180
there's a problem for everything I mean

960
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,980
we've got to be able to go in and

961
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,779
install our own security updates we've

962
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,119
got to be able to go in and have

963
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,609
somebody else help us support our older

964
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,609
devices be it firmware or hardware

965
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:18,240
otherwise man the stuffs gonna get

966
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:22,029
thrown away so fast it's ridiculous

967
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,520
sure we often products that are

968
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:28,390
repairable and not just disposable are a

969
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,490
little more expensive because it takes

970
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,710
extra work to you know make them I mean

971
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,328
it's it's easy it's easy for the

972
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,589
manufacturers to just do through makes

973
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:38,410
me ask you throw it out

974
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:40,869
but that is only because really there

975
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,629
You've the manufacturers externalized

976
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:45,849
the disposal cost of those can you

977
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,920
comment at all on how we can DX

978
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:52,270
journalize those costs so that the

979
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
disposable things are not simply cheaper

980
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,650
because they're externalized without

981
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,450
also it without simultaneously hurting

982
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,640
you know low-income communities that

983
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,339
can't afford the more expensive premium

984
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,759
things I'm not sure I understand what

985
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:09,910
you mean by externalize it costs money

986
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,640
to dispose of electronics the cost of

987
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:15,910
having a so like there are these

988
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,640
horrifying single-use cell phone charges

989
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,990
that you can buy and it's a battery you

990
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,410
plug in your phone charge the phone once

991
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,859
and then it's waste now those are pretty

992
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:29,290
cheap but though that's a very expensive

993
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,970
product for the public in the world to

994
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,220
deal with because you can just imagine

995
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,810
looking at a pallet full of these these

996
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,339
I mean this is like this is all these

997
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,599
toxic materials sitting in landfill

998
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:40,210
forever

999
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,740
that's a those those costs live with

1000
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:46,000
society so that to me that's what I

1001
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:50,890
think there's a couple couple ways we

1002
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,630
can do this one if we need to this is

1003
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,578
why I talk about attacking the throwaway

1004
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,740
culture like we need people to have an

1005
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:59,829
expectation of repair ability and we

1006
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,959
need there to be like when things are

1007
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:04,599
not repairable it needs to be a

1008
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,520
significant issue for the companies that

1009
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:07,520
make it

1010
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,960
and and I think that there's a lot of

1011
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,000
policies that you could go that would

1012
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,310
add cost to doing those wasteful things

1013
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,050
but then also I think we need to just

1014
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,990
build that expectation for all the stuff

1015
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,670
in our lives

1016
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,560
hello I wish there was more time for

1017
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,750
questions but the folks couldn't be

1018
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,670
available outside the the conference

1019
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,900
room to to answer any further questions

1020
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,520
and gay you'd mention that you would

1021
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,740
like their hacker community to help your

1022
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,600
work how can they get in touch with you

1023
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,459

1024
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,259

1025
