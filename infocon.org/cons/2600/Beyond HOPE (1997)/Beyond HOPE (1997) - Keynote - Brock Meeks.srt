hello okay trying it again

14
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,900
okay okay welcome to be on hope

15
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,000
the

16
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,660
arm we only starting about 10 minutes
late this year

17
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,500
three years ago we started about two
hours away so we're getting better and

18
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,980
as you may have noticed registration
went smoothly this time didn't have to

19
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,530
wait around

20
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,180
morning thanks to the registration
volunteers out there we have a lot of

21
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,220
things going on

22
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,830
right now we're looking at live pictures
from our twin

23
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,900
conference Holland packing in progress
where their

24
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,940
know what they're doing actually but you
know we have this picture tells unit

25
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,770
we can control the camera from here can
we do I go

26
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,210
ball back or something or more power

27
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,390
see we're doing that were controlling
their camera right now

28
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,740
over there over an hour on now it looks
a little bit

29
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,710
jerky and the reason for that is because
it requires three ISDN lines right now

30
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,650
we're only using

31
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,060
1 we will be using three later on today
says we are not a few kinks

32
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,790
by the idea is to have them communicate
with us real time we communicate with

33
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,969
them real time so it's

34
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,830
it's breaking edge technology
cutting-edge technology what this is

35
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,470
also

36
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,340
the first hacker convention in this
country I've been to do that

37
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,580
actually as really good connection to
the outside internet

38
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,070
and for that we should thank Marco and
all the other

39
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:15,070
network people that have work going
through the night to get that happening

40
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,470
Ryan is here he's got some updates on
network stuff that's happening

41
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,630
things to do things not to do problems
we've had so far

42
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,270
we're hoping to accomplish Ryan I'm not
even a star with the

43
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,939
I

44
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,660
we have a 10 megabits connection to the
inner small

45
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,660
home odds are call that's about 71 look
at all the pictures

46
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,130
the logistics if you've got a computer
you want the network through

47
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,490
I hope you saw that work became hitters

48
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,220
there's got Hobbs

49
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,240
we love you plug them in some ways and
share

50
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,630
if you need all-star

51
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,640
with the serious geek stuff if you know
it DHCP

52
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,699
is and you can use it do now your honor

53
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,340
if you need a static IP I will be in the
network room after this

54
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,260
will be giving out static IP's

55
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,730
for you what it involves will give you a
piece of paper with a number on it if

56
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,790
you already have a static IP if I talk
to already given your number

57
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,520
you need to come to me and pick up the
piece of paper with your number on it

58
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,520
so if there's a conflict you with if you
don't have a computer

59
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,430
ignore everything I've said because you
don't need numbers

60
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,850
I DNS servers asks

61
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,120
stuff like that if you do you're all
that information is on a poster

62
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,570
up near the doorway between the network
room commerce by

63
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,780
stock if you don't have a computer by
the way you can still participate if you

64
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,160
can

65
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,939
I look over people's shoulders ask a lot
of questions and make use of the public

66
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,220
terminals that we have as well

67
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,270
we have banks public external makes a
public

68
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,540
dumb terminals their guest for those

69
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,540
the BR machine ready for human
consumption we will have

70
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,840
a at least a couple a handful

71
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,340
hope that volunteers

72
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,130
there will be giving out your usernames
and passwords

73
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,610
as orderly a fashion as we can manage

74
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:00,280
look for me in network room I will be
with the

75
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,370
people

76
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,990
there's favor circulating I hope awesome

77
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,280
that as a forage

78
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:17,280
say this is what I like by username to
be so

79
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,320
have that hand you

80
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,280
reached the front at the very very order
to

81
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,970
ok network operations marchers

82
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,630
okay are we ready to begin to pick up
love notes we've

83
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,720
we've had all kinds of media people here
their TV crews around if you don't want

84
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,390
to be filmed just tell them so

85
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,670
they will leave you alone they don't you
leave you alone when a bus

86
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,790
will take care of them expect a lot of
people to be around though

87
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,490
looking at what you're doing expected
your being washed all times if you have

88
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,130
a machine on the network expect to be

89
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,150
act because that's what we're all here
for we have a couple other interesting

90
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,170
marketing typing first evolved with
nothing to do with all the stickers

91
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,380
popping up on people and drop pounds

92
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,480
we don't condone that kind of activity

93
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,640
it is kinda interesting out just like my
neck stickers speaking

94
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,310
speaking of stickers I have it on good
authority and this is the true

95
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,270
this is the God's honest truth in the
oval office

96
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,170
in the White House president clinton's
office underneath the rock

97
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,670
you will find one of these don't ask me
how

98
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,180
for the beyond hope original stickers
that was sent out on subscribers I don't

99
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,470
know

100
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,890
you subscribe to restock it there but I
happen to know for a fact that this will

101
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,610
drive the secret service crazy

102
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,610
has enough to rip up the carpet but when
they do the

103
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,829
the coin a phrase we r everywhere are a
couple things that we have this time

104
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,140
we've never had before

105
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,680
we have CD-rom's over the merchandising
off the hook which is the radio show

106
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,570
that we do

107
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,320
on the radio station WBAI here in new
york has to do with acting

108
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,830
2600 all kinds and the things that
happen throughout the years

109
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,110
we've been doing this since 1988
actually in this the first time all the

110
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,290
shows have been available

111
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,040
I and we're making this cheap as we
possibly can make it so if you wanna

112
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,819
was just shows a CD-rom is about two
years worth shows on each CD-rom

113
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,980
I like about a hundred hours and is the
real audio format are so

114
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,760
check out the merchandiser and I ask
people about those good things but

115
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,189
we have we have a limited supply of
those so I were also a limited supply of

116
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,510
these

117
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,000
major hacking cookies on the freeway
seen these by there's

118
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,690
there's a is gonna be here later
actually is a guy who is in the army

119
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,140
he's a major and his last name is
hacking and

120
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,630
he makes cookies and the really good to
sell doing some souvenirs to bring back

121
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,430
we thought this would be kinda cool
thing to have some major hacking copies

122
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,720
available in three flavors:

123
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,260
we also have the new issue 2600 was just
came out the last week was on the cover

124
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,050
I don't know

125
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,510
and we have the free issue which shows
available to anybody who wants it are

126
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,920
we have a bunch of things to tell you
but we'll tell you know throughout the

127
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,770
day we don't want to

128
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,069
keep rock makes waiting any longer Brock
is

129
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,870
someone has been within the hacker
community for quite some time

130
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,070
back in nineteen ninety-two we had an
incident

131
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,160
in washington's Pentagon City Mall at
2600 meeting

132
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,110
where security guards broke up the
meeting brock meeks is the reporter

133
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,560
discovered Monday morning by calling up
the security office

134
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,460
that the secret service was behind the
whole operation in a

135
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,530
had ordered the security guards
illegally detained in search people

136
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,420
funny thing is he call them at nine
o'clock at about 9:15

137
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,070
the security guards got a call from the
secret service saying don't tell anybody

138
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,020
about this

139
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,010
so it's a an example of how good
journalists can get the story before

140
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,000
I anybody can stop them since then iraq
has been

141
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,140
a key player in the fight against

142
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,480
clipper the fight against Israel
telephony all kinds of privacy issues

143
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,300
that affect every last one of us with or
without computers

144
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,440
and now you can see rock beats as a
regular correspondent on

145
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,570
MSNBC and rock is here today

146
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,570
is our keno speaker pleased to introduce
brock meeks

147
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,140
thank you very much

148

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,959
let me say

151
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,639
hacker community

152
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,829
has always been wanna my favorites

153
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,910
I am NOT hacker by any stretch of the
imagination I'm just

154
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,169
journalist scribe I chronicle what
happens

155
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:13,709
back in early

156
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:19,230
I guess the mid eighties when I first
got on the net before it was even called

157
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,689
the net

158
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:22,789
you some the old-timers here will
remember that you had

159
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,129
type in all the machines the 12 route

160
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,240
your message to email was kinda like
digital

161
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
Pony Express I was on at that time

162
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,370
using the net are using an electronic
means

163
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,190
to report and the report on a lot of the
things that were happening

164
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,460
even back then in the early eighties

165
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,100
we saw the start the incredible
misinformation

166
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,429
that the mainstream media was spinning
about the hacker community

167
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:59,169
and I always took a separate in contact
the folks that were involved

168
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,280
activity and not judging them but say
look

169
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,320
I wanna tell your story from your point
of view I didn't go on a pretend to be

170
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,740
somebody else like

171
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,840
newsweek reporter Richards stands or
whatever and

172
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,539
and trying to see anybody I was always a
prime and I think I got respect for that

173
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:20,830
and I think I also got respect for being
able

174
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,899
to get to the bottom things and tell
their side of the story tell your side

175
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,610
the story as fairly as I could

176
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,830
let me start now

177
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,549
with my own hack start

178
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,220
with the media hack how many journalists
do we have here in the room today

179
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,490
good will turn off the cameras

180
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,700
this is all off the record did you hear
me

181
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,470
the cameras this speech is all off the
record

182
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,190
no objections

183
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,809
well ladies and gentlemen this is what's
the problem

184
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,330
with mainstream media today no balls

185
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,908
I should have heard cries of outrage or
people

186
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:18,909
getting up any journalist that would
accept

187
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:25,130
a public speeches off-the-record you
know I should hear some UN cry

188
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,720
walk out the room do something now of
course I'm kidding

189
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,500
the speech is on the record but here's
the point that I wanna make

190
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,350
you're gonna have to learn how to hack
the media because frankly

191
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,549
you haven't a good job you set the terms

192
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,970
when somebody when a reporter calls you
you

193
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,360
said the ground rules tell them this is

194
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,110
off-the-record this is on background
this is not for attribution whatever

195
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,250
don't know what those terms are you
learn

196
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,620
what they are and you discuss the
journalist before you say

197
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,360
anything you control

198
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,230
the interview because once the words
come out your mouth believe me having

199
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,570
been on the other end

200
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,830
the word processor I know how words can
be spun

201
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,070
entirely outta control so you set the
ground rules

202
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,490
you learn how hack media

203
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,960
okay now we're on the record

204
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,770
when I spent my torturous year with
wired magazine

205
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,610
last year working for that great
dysfunctional family

206
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,470
ice to show up and speak at different
events

207
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,370
and because I'm was the washington
correspondent you know I'll

208
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,460
I wore the Washington uniform with a
suit and tie and

209
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,460
and people would often be amused or a
little bit

210
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,880
put back when they will see a represent
Wired Magazine

211
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,730
wearing a tie and so i would tell people
look I'm the only one in the company

212
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,110
that

213
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,130
wears a tie and doesn't yet have a part
of his body

214
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,890
here's so I succumbed to peer pressure

215
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,440
and had my nipple pierced well

216
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
as it turns out of course then I went to
work for

217
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,280
MSNBC where

218
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,059
everybody wears a tie I but nobody has

219
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,049
a part of their body pierced as a course
you believe that ugly double piercing

220
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,940
rumor about tom brokaw

221
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,960
that's not a true story

222
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,490
let me tell you about one of my favorite
hacking stories kinda set the tone here

223
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,840
it's not a classic act in this sense
getting into a machine or something like

224
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,470
that but it's a good illustration

225
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,780
couple years ago maybe several years ago
now I forget was when the

226
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,799
Democrats still control congress

227
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,870
at Marquee the chairman of the
telecommunications subcommittee was

228
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,909
holding a hearing

229
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,049
had Emmanuel Goldstein up there
testifying

230
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,210
it was a setup marquee wanted to rake

231
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,280
Emanuel and 2600 over the coals

232
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,928
he called him a criminal call even
outlaw said 2600 magazine was nothing

233
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:21,440
but

234
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,780
you know I think even use the word
terrorist publication or something like

235
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,928
that I mean it was

236
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,630
it was a slam job and i cant believe
marquee was

237
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,659
was doing it cuz precluding guy but this
was markey's

238
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:38,790
and 10 market just didn't get

239
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,639
what the whole hacking culture and what
the whole

240
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:49,639
process is about certainly didn't
understand 2600 magazine

241
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,580
now there's a million ed markey's out
there

242
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,559
you gonna have to watch out for

243
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,200
now I can't condone hacking activity

244
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
the majority hack why

245
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,220
because it's legal

246
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,159
those are the laws in other words were
parted jail

247
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,299
don't you understand that said

248
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:22,240
I accept hacking and hacking culture I
believe in it

249
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,270
and I believe that it serves critical
vital function

250
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,918
in today's community as part in the
delicate

251
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,970
checks and balances what's happening in
cyberspace

252
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,270
hacking at its core pushes the envelope

253
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,070
or it should push the envelope

254
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,070
exposes witnesses it forces people
corporation and yes

255
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,220
even governments to and to make
themselves

256
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,220
stronger this is what ed markey most the
people in washington don't understand

257
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,720
month after month I guess it's quarter
after quarter 2600

258
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,409
publishes new hacks new holes in the
telephone system and what does the

259
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,510
telephone

260
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:14,770
telephone companies in AT&T do by and
large they ignore it

261
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,210
now anyplace else

262
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,230
in the financial community if

263
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,559
security all popped up for a problem pop

264
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,840
Wall Street insured would be all over

265
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,899
some fucking corporation if they didn't

266
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:34,220
fix these holes in the telephone
companies get away with it

267
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,000
read these things I guess they think you
guys are inactive

268
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,200
and they fail the patch these holes and
then they cry about it

269
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,280
when somebody exploit got them all
doesn't make any sense to me

270
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,559
Wall Street ignores it the financial
community

271
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,830
ignores it the holes that they do patch
of course

272
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,178
only makes the system stronger

273
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:02,620
this is what I'm talking about with
checks and balances with Mark

274
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,549
didn't understand we thought it was just
some kind of outlaw publication

275
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,408
now personally I'd some 16 year old with

276
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:17,130
no social life sitting around trying to
expose a security hole

277
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,220
pentagon computer then some rogue nation

278
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,220
back into the Pentagon

279
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:33,759
and if you don't think the rogue nations
are out there doing this type

280
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,869
you're wrong you can tell by the sweat

281
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,100
breaks out on the upper lips the NSA
guys and

282
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,320
CIA guys when they testified now they
get a lot of things wrong

283
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,059
have to spend for the public but they're
fucking scared folks

284
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,879
because it's happening I'd rather have
one

285
00:25:54,879 --> 00:26:01,789
you exposed all then have some kinda
rogue nation that

286
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:06,129
for some kind economic espionage or
worse

287
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:11,830
that's where the national security
threat is not from some 16 year old

288
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,830
sittin around as hell

289
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,029
that reminds me I was just on capitol
hill the other day

290
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:27,240
listening to some Subcommittee on
national security

291
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,350
figure said that twenty percent of our
government's computer systems

292
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,600
have been subjected Thames I wrote that

293
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,610
I said what the fuck is this twenty
percent you that's a pretty god damn low

294
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,539
percentage

295
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,629
get off your ass and go up

296
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,090
you know

297
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,260
in baseball 200 batting average

298
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,340
every factory and

299
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,190
the government's line fudge factor we're
talking about less than two

300
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,190
a less than 200 batting average

301
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,350
and that's the ticket to the minor
leagues 20 percent

302
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,779
unfortunately I think that

303
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,720
figure which is probably much lower than
20 percent

304
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,970
represents hack

305
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,240
yesterday in the minor leagues now

306
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,659
where are the elegant hacks up today

307
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:32,330
elegant hacks I'm talking about dan
farmer

308
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,220
and its creation say that's an elegant
hack

309
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,470
we're talking about

310
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,299
iraq's was chronicled in a sec were
dispatched

311
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,960
look wrote about informed

312
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,360
hacking infamous spammers

313
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,140
wallace's machine pointing out that
information to the net

314
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,539
that's an elegant hack the most

315
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,600
hacks course was when Matt blaze some

316
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,690
the clipper chip when he found easy way

317
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,330
disprove a key part the verification
process

318
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,449
now Matt crack

319
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,510
clipper chip sure the hell at and for
all intents and purposes

320
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,240
he signed Clippers DEP warrant and of
course there is

321
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,000
the penultimate law and that's using

322
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,110
your experience to eventually gain

323
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:38,110
big bucks consulting contract

324
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,320
and you know who you are now

325
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,700
these days all too often

326
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,220
we hear a stories so-called

327
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,660
hacking stories for example this

328
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,290
extortionist overseas who finds a
security hole in netscape and decides

329
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,050
that the standing-room Ward money isn't
enough he wants more

330
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,990
so it tries to blackmail did netscape

331
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,520
to give any more money for exposing this
whole that's not a hack

332
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,350
that's extortion and then we hear

333
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,450
def on a few weeks ago where people are
trying

334
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:29,150
pass of counterfeit twenty dollar bills
that's not at a crime

335
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:34,140
that's a crime and then we

336
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,960
scores scores a quote unquote

337
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,960
lol hackers

338
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,810
let me tell you

339
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,860
when the media thinks about

340
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,650
won the first thing that pops into their
mind

341
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,690
are these digital juvenile delinquents

342
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,690
masturbating on on AOL

343
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:13,409
only al-haq

344
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:18,459
Nicholas Ryan figure it out wrote the
AOL for free program everybody else

345
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:24,440
since then is basically just been a
copycat we talk about copycats for a

346
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,289
while if you're following some

347
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,679
buddy else's hack if you grab 2600
magazine

348
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,769
your type what's happening there

349
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,899
all you're doing

350
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,029
is basically following

351
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,190
nothing more than martha mitchell
cookbook and

352
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:50,190
no bake in a bunt cake 2600 magazine

353
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the

354
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:07,270
2600 magazine wasn't meant as an
instruction manual

355
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,110
2600 magazine is like

356
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:18,110
guy where people have gone 40 use that
and to build on it you have to invent

357
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,120
and develop

358
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,280
and build things and god damn it

359
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,070
you have to break not just fall in
somebody else's

360
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:39,169
footsteps now going into the next
millennium this gets even more and more

361
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,830
crucial

362
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,810
if you continue to push the envelope

363
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:50,520
and you do this with the business world
and with the government I guarantee they

364
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,320
will probably continue to despise you

365
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,659
but they won't be able to ignore you

366
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,220
if you to if they try I'm sure

367
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,480
that she'll hurt them don't be gentle

368
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,270
do not go quietly into the night and for
christ sake

369
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,900
be smart if you gonna follow

370
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,320
you gonna do something don't leave your
digital litter

371
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,240
strewn all over cyberspace it's a quick

372
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,280
ticket to jail and again

373
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,810
what part jail don't you understand you
find people here that have been there

374
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,889
it's not a pleasant place now

375
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,530
the feds are getting smarter don't you

376
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,420
get stupider keep them racing to catch
up

377
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,980
it'll make you stronger it will make

378
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,010
net stronger and when the net is
stronger

379
00:32:54,010 --> 00:33:01,010
in the end we all win thank you

380
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,720
now willa open the floor to

381
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,720
questions if you have any and I'll see
if I can some answers

382
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,220
next thing any questions

383
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Campoli I

384
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:26,730
okay got the yeah I will

385
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,520
also we're gonna have people come up
here and they can party from this micro

386
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,610
she s basically what I thought about

387
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,280
how the net is becoming more
commercialized with big money

388
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,929
interest suck more more than that making
information less available

389
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,050
to other people make it more difficult
for people to get information as

390
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,490
becomes more and more commercializing I
think about that

391
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,840
generally i I'm not opposed to the
commercialization

392
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,440
the internet because he is making it
generally

393
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,420
more available to a wider number of
people more and more

394
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,430
corporations are coming online and what
does that do

395
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,868
well for one thing gives hackers more
than opportunity to

396
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:16,730
explore their application but I think
the other thing that

397
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,050
is a problem is that as

398
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,700
the big moneyed interests get involved
they want to protect

399
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,410
their interests and so they start to try
and gain control

400
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,730
one other things that we see is a great
example that this is the whole flap

401
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,510
that's going on

402
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,210
now about domain names and who's going
to become the registrars and so on and

403
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,790
so forth

404
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,640
we have this proposal on the table right
now that essentially turn

405
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,190
the domain name registries into a UN
type system controlled Geneva

406
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,440
by the International Telcom
Telecommunication Union

407
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,990
operates under charter Swiss law for
christ sake

408
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,359
if anybody has ever had dealing with the
UN

409
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,299
you know how that places and now they
want to put

410
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,330
net domain name registries under control

411
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:13,330
you in style tribunal it's bad news

412
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,209
I A yeah

413
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:25,439
question what made you decide to take
her side

414
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:31,609
storms that the the slant ration because
I could

415
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,049
I did

416
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:41,319
for one thing I knew that the people
that were doing the heck

417
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:47,808
in those days it was a majority was with
kids I knew that these kids were not you

418
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:48,579
know all

419
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,869
miscreants and juvenile delinquents as

420
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:55,839
as the media was was portraying to be a
think they were inquisitive

421
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,089
they were kids maybe felt ostracized

422
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:04,239
by their peers and so forth they got
into computers and

423
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,359
just sense they got into computers
because they're interested in

424
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,719
they were being as criminals and I knew
there was a different story to tell

425
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,859
besides that I had talked to a few
started hearing things like

426
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,630
you know I see my parents

427
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,709
making cassette tape recordings of

428
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,979
and passing them around

429
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:31,609
isn't copyright violation and I see my
parents cheating on their taxes and so

430
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:32,328
on and so forth

431
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,449
what with they were doing wasn't hurting
anybody

432
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,449
they were still on anything for christ
sake and yet they were being portrayed

433
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:41,309
as criminals

434
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:44,509
nobody's telling their story whenever

435
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:47,519
as a journalist when I see a big hole

436
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,380
nobody else is covering well
opportunistic it's that I am

437
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,709
I moved right into I was telling a story

438
00:37:55,709 --> 00:38:01,239
that nobody else was telling X question
have you

439
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,549
ever had any story slam by MSNBC that
they just did not

440
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:10,119
on done no one other thing I was very

441
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,609
leery of going to work for MSNBC and I
got assurances from

442
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:22,058
everybody I worked with their I was
gonna be working with Microsoft wasn't

443
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:26,380
habits fingerprints on any of the news I
believe

444
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,289
the people that I was talking to because
they were all news professionals

445
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,419
but I went to it being very skeptical

446
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:36,589
pleasantly surprised that

447
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:40,849
Microsoft is really nowhere to be found
on the news side

448
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:45,619
except for the fact that we all pitch in
because the brain gets software we have

449
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,390
to use that Microsoft supplies

450
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:54,390
got knows

451
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:58,669
several years ago i didst all of my

452
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,479
you know when tell step so my PC's of

453
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:05,829
and got everything and got maxine
declared

454
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:10,179
declared by declared my home Microsoft
freeze

455
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:13,919
and of course Microsoft

456
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,949
because I work with their software but
the thing that I

457
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,999
is working for MSNBC is that Microsoft

458
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:23,839
huge and there are so many different

459
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,699
05 them projects nope and everybody's
concerned about keeping their project

460
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,969
alive in keeping their budget alive
nobody really has

461
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,859
time to put their fingers on the news

462
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:41,499
one things that's in my contract is that
the first time I get a whip

463
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:45,140
MSNBC has stopped Microsoft story

464
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:52,140
anywhere I walk my contract

465
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,150
hit your critical the media

466
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,279
but what I herbal lot of packing stories

467
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:05,529
about what happens to what about what
the government does is in reverse crack

468
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:08,999
it's a tempest what can what does the
media due to its

469
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:12,059
stuff like that government taxing that's
what they've come up with

470
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:16,969
share with us well I think we have a
media panel later on today and that's

471
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:18,599
one of the questions you should ask

472
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,930
it's a fair question right now

473
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,629
just last night somebody turned me on to
a story that I think you

474
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,499
surprising involves the NSA

475
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:34,910
and this one is reversed kinda crack

476
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,999
stories wanna tell anybody about it
journalists here

477
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,819
break in that story pretty soon years
ago

478
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:46,259
I was the first one to break stories
about the the pentagon

479
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:51,170
had signed on hackers and they were
creating

480
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,309
viruses to putting computers that were
shipped out to Bulgaria

481
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,969
to and they were doing this all on the
slide

482
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:04,099
or so you know i've covered those types
with the media in general

483
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,949
and that's a good question to ask I
can't speak for all

484
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:14,949
media so asked the media panel

485
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,020
hi as a journalist yourself do you see
push technology

486
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,590
as going backwards instead of forwards
and development better information

487
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,350
transmission

488
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,830
and customization I'm not a big fan of
push technology

489
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,400
I think that push technology as a matter
fact stars to make

490
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,760
become more and more like a broadcast
medium in that you no longer have to go

491
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,090
in search for things

492
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,290
they start to come you and when

493
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,480
net starts to become more and more

494
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,720
like a broadcast medium what happens
congress is gonna come in and they're

495
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,310
gonna say

496
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,600
back in 1997

497
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,030
it was in a broadcast medium knew that
so we struck down the communications

498
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,950
decency act

499
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,260
now it does look like a broadcast

500
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,350
smells like a broadcast in functions
like a broadcast medium

501
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:17,190
now we can regulate I think we have to
be very careful about how the net

502
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,990
involves

503
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,880
we're gonna see this issue revisited as
the net looks more and more like

504
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,990
broadcast I don't see a whole lotta ways

505
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,770
we can defend seen is different and
broadcast so i think thats

506
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,009
push technology start just down there

507
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,350
it's not going to be the critical factor

508
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,420
streaming video stuff becomes more

509
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,870
I think still maybe five years out we
have to be very careful on how the net

510
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,630
develops

511
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,190
or its gonna look a lot like TV and
radio happens

512
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:56,180
its regular like TV and radio for
someone to say I was a good speech

513
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,759
I do the tape the market hearing with
the I know boxing testifying if you do

514
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,660
could you produce it

515
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,140
I don't have the tape I'm sure somebody

516
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,660
you get a transcript but that was
several years ago

517
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,290
open it was a time when there weren't C
span cameras around anything like that

518
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:20,290
ask emmanuel I think he has a transcript
pay

519
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,310
following you consider all country I
mean in other words in

520
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,930
your personal opinion what's the
difference between hacker in the US

521
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,450
into a government agency computer or

522
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,850
want in any other country was a bit
different

523
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,350
any personal opinion how can you call
such countries as

524
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,220
row some countries stroke countries
thanks

525
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,360
some bro countries well if for

526
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,700
for one thing the rogue activity

527
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,770
I know is when hacker

528
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,170
is a government agent is his

529
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,280
operative a rogue nation that is
attacking

530
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,450
US installation US government computer

531
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,430
for the sole purpose espionage

532
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,850
ort or for some other kind national
security violation that

533
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,279
there in the employ of another
government hacking into somebody else's

534
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,150
government now

535
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,620
if our government attack to iraq

536
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,180
to France or whatever America becomes
the rogue nations the same type

537
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,629
deal if it's government-sponsored
attacks against somebody else

538
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,710
the same dealers in america differences

539
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,180
a 16-year-old home

540
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,740
and somebody overseas that is employed
pay

541
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:54,740
by some foreign country

542
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,520
what do you think recent my curse of and
Macintosh

543
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,300
alliance that's in my

544
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,450
holy war speech for another time okay

545
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:14,450
that's fair I mean for every for
everybody Apple stock it was great

546
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,450
Apple about six bucks a share my

547
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,590
my parents who I told to buy thousand
more shares

548
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,130
Apple when it dipped to thirteen dollars
a share

549
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,190
my dad is extremely happy now followed
my advice

550
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,340
there's a lot of employees at Apple
morale was way down

551
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,820
they saw their stock options damn near
double they're very happy

552
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,450
I think Microsoft make sure

553
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:49,300
has healthy revenue stream secured

554
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,410
for a pittance for 150

555
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,160
million dollars they saw their own share
and Apple

556
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,129
raised by about fifty million dollars so

557
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:06,120
for 150 million dollars which is peanuts
to Microsoft I think it's a good deal

558
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,350
all the way around we have to see the
key thing here

559
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:15,350
course focuses Microsoft the devil's in
the details of the licensing and patent

560
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,820
agreement

561
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,630
want to see how that shakes out because
Microsoft frankly doesn't have a real

562
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,440
good track record going in

563
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,310
looking at other people's books and
technology implant fair and square just

564
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:27,650
ask

565
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,760
to it about I was

566
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,300
sorry I was wondering here you had a

567
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,800
tape the when he called the Pentagon
City

568
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,940
mall the security officers yes

569
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,950
duality I refer to it as Johnson tape

570
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,630
because security directors name

571
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,170
last name was Johnson and

572
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,630
at it was very funny because

573
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,980
part I was gonna ask possible

574
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:06,180
on the web somewhere somebody wants
touch

575
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:12,830
later talk about transferring and so
forth was very funny about that

576
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,680
that instance because I did call very
early in the morning

577
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,069
this guy on the tape and I said doing
harassing these kids

578
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,040
they weren't doing anything Johnson goes

579
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,720
well you know it was there was an us was
a my guys it was

580
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,990
the secret service and FBI there all
year this of course was after I ask

581
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,340
I can talk to you and I said I'm just
trying to get some information

582
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,770
i cant talk I said well if I come down
there we talk to me

583
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,100
talk and so I I'm just going on and on

584
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,990
you think I slowly crack city secret
service the FBI

585
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,090
here so I published my story

586
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,480
then he was denying that he ever said
this to me

587
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,480
of course I forgot to tell him that I
was taking the conversation sue me

588
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,490
course in the district of columbia only
one person has to know that the tape

589
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,200
recording is being played and

590
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,990
done so I knew

591
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,869
so Johnson was the nine this and people
were

592
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:33,610
journalists were then writing stories
countering my story Johnson denies

593
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,820
so on and so forth for the next all day

594
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,200
I was just telling i got really pissed I
said listen just give me a phone call

595
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,680
play

596
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,330
tape for you so tape reporters common as
planes take over and over again

597
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,190
and so then of course the next day
stories were we contacted

598
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:56,240
rock he played the tape yes indeed the
secret service and so on and so forth

599
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,770
there course they were but they use the
Pentagon City

600
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,619
a cop guys as therefore oils and the
whole thing was just a big

601
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,970
as our mess still have the tape I don't
think Johnson

602
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:14,970
I know Johnson around it Pentagon City I
was wondering

603
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:19,240
where do you think hacking is going next
hacked

604
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,240
cracked going to be any predictions you
know

605
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,930
I don't have any predictions I think
downward slide like I said I think it's

606
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:28,970
in the minor leagues

607
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,609
I don't see too many elegant heck's
going on these days

608
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:36,369
I see I see a lot of copycats

609
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:39,810
we see quote-unquote ale

610
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,040
step I see far too many elegant

611
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,690
tax I think you guys have to pump
ratcheted up a notch

612
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:54,690
busy like I said push the envelope start
to break things to stop other people's

613
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,840
footsteps or the next big hacks gonna be
that's your job

614
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,880
my job to report no predictions

615
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,000
questions

616
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,609
all right thank you very much
