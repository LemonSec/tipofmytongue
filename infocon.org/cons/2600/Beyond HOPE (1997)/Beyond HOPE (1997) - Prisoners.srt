1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,420
to the restrictions by he does get
everything now I believe

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,820
we have some former prisoners right here

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,730
I in the studio or or whenever really
wanna call this thing

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,860
arm and you may be wondering why

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,119
we have these little walls put up on

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,859
on stage was a reason for that arm when
you sent to prison

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,149
and you released lots of times they

8
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,130
they kinda wanna keep control %uh view
after you get outta prison and they make

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,759
all these

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,890
restrictions on things you can and
cannot do and one other thing is you

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,019
cannot do

12
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,030
is converse with other people who have
been in prison

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,940
so the only way we could bring you this
panel tonight would be if these people

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,239
that are here

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,239
have no knowledge are the other people
that are there and are at no risk

16
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,850
whatsoever of communicating

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,050
with them so I ask for cooperation in
this that

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,929
that you know people are not
communicating between the two are these

19
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,489

77
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,769

78
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:01,769

but some are gaffer's tape work after
state thank you

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,169
I'm a bill was at a hundred thousand
dollars I was as I said charge for two

81
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,130
things at the session but the actual

82
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,610
technical description the crimes
Pennsylvania misdemeanor Chu

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,330
position at the other device but that
the telecommunication services

84
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,849
and the other charger was charged with a
felony 3

85
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,110
unauthorized you so the computer on the
charge was really described well

86
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,629
arrest warrant

87
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,379
as a sword of Damocles I

88
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,580
so I was a was arraigned the next
morning and

89
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,839
a local judge Shira saw no evidence at
all

90
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,779
if that wasn't his job to find any
evidence he saw that there is nothing in

91
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,308
the affidavit said I'd access to any
computer at all

92
00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:00,979
the the police department's argument was
that because I had something that could

93
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,360
modify tone dialer and because the
telephone system

94
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,279
telephones are connected to the year a
computer network this largely controlled

95
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,169
by computers

96
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,139
using such a device would act constitute
unauthorized access a computer

97
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,349
even others no allegation the affidavit
for the rest used at me

98
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,808
box I so I which I just had like

99
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,369
I can even arrange his felony charge
because there's nothing even presented

100
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:28,909
in the war

101
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,199
for it so I was left with a misdemeanor
charge but the a list of seven hundred

102
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,159
thousand dollars

103
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,379
which I didn't happen have on hand time
I

104
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,709
so I was taken to a teller County Prison
rather

105
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:47,709
filthy place and my preliminary hearing
was delayed

106
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,779
twice now is there for over a month if I
found I had my ear

107
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,639
Lemaire hearing which point the state
drop discharge

108
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,559
and Secret Service said announced showed
up at the hearing

109
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:03,749
announced they're going to file federal
charges against and at that time I was

110
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:05,749
charged by the secret service officially

111
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:11,039
with possession actual at the time was a
title 18 section 10:29

112
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,889
a-6 P which I've never heard open

113
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,039
my attorney had never heard have reason
we never heard of it because the

114
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,469
law was so new had not published in a
law books yet and I was the first person

115
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:28,808
country charged and after some research
we found out that

116
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,919
its editor now a federal felony to
possess

117
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,099
a hardware or software for

118
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,339
the modification of telecommunications
instruments

119
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,439
for the unauthorized access to
telecommunications services

120
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,699
and all the all the

121
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,959
the criminal complaint from the feds

122
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,779
said that that equipment consisted of an
idea laptop computer

123
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:56,560
up cables and

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
it and an application that allowed
someone to

125
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,589
program sailor telephones program them
with

126
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,719
phone numbers and electronic she
remembers no allegation in the

127
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:11,808
in the criminal complaint that I

128
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:15,749
use this program a sailor founded
offering

129
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:19,689
this by did meet the definition up
statue

130
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,779
so I was

131
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,180
transported by the secret service
arrested at the prison after taking back

132
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,439
their

133
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,969
very caring and take by the secret

136
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:39,360

158
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:52,519
while

159
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,890
the place was a searched for a bomb
which

160
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,559
was a false bomb threat fortune and

161
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,469
secret service's first argument was that
I was a danger to their reasoning and

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,480
hold you withhold you

163
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,779
without bail is if you are a threat to
the community work

164
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,470
risk of flight well the secret service
argued that because

165
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,500
I some other books in my house at about
two thousand books

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,339
some other the campers three but they
didn't say how many

167
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,959
30 2000 bucks I down were about how
explosive

168
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,170
for me and when the judge for that he

169
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,620
yellow is classes and looked at me and
said

170
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,279
no bail he said it was a

171
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,939
tenuous time for government officials
and I think they're all great power

172
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:45,079
explosives I'm I'm not a bomb bill agree
I read all kinds

173
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,939
strange texts that was a bad time to
cover the wrong hands a box

174
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:54,390
I was illegal ur dangers to have books
early it is now

175
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,470
so I was a locked in a holding cell US
Marshals there the building waiting to

176
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,730
be transported to the federal facility
in fair

177
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,750
New Jersey and well as in a holding cell

178
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,920
or some other prisoners there who were

179
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
told me that during the time that the
the building had been evacuated as a

180
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,969
bomb threat

181
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,370
but they've been left in the cell and
the US Marshals

182
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,059
evacuated with everyone else I measures
left in there so if there had been a

183
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,630
bomb they would have been

184
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,049
amongst the rubble I guess a couple
hours later were transported an armored

185
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,290
van

186
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,059
I couple hours away to fair New Jersey
and it was a pretty a

187
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,510
pretty amazing sight seeing this
facility it had

188
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,649
very high like fourteen foot high

189
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,779
razor wire in sconce defenses to love
them about can feet apart

190
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,949
with all kinds a electronic sensors on
them

191
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,750
surrounding a bigger big facility kinda
looks like a college campus except all

192
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,380
the buildings were

193
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,140
like heavily armored and

194
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,540
was brought in there is pretty imposing
looking

195
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,000
and %uh that began my seven month

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,010
period in federal prison

197
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,370
how we doing on time

198
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,970
manual yeah I'm sorry how much how are
we doing on time are you falling asleep

199
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,689
they ran out of mind I just that

200
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:22,279
you've been through a lot and we need to
we think

201
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,740
just really sketchy outline of what it
is that you went through because

202
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,079
well there there are more things that we
have to talk about that

203
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,350
you don't have to know about about is
talking less about the experiences ahead

204
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,760
prison well if you could just give us a
time line okay

205
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,299
when you when you were first arrested
and when you were finally released

206
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,679
and what it was that you were arrested
for released for are

207
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,439
and then we can we can move on it's more
detail in just a little bit okay

208
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,610
i reschedule I was a

209
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,529
spent a few months there and I was held
in the year

210
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,959
the facility that's reserved for
pre-trial inmates everyone there has

211
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,480
progressed to where

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,329
orange jumpsuits recall carrots

213
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:09,240
by the guards to look like carrots
running around

214
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,319
and they don't have a

215
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,510
they don't have all the same privileges
the people who were designated to that

216
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,949
facility have a pair

217
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,639
don't have the same access to the law
library and that sort of thing

218
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,130
ironically

219
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,929
but a I managed to get some access the
law library which was in a bad light

220
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,429
but there's not much guide using I
witnessed the

221
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,669
two stabbings one of them fatal numerous

222
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:37,939
fights which ended in severe injury I am

223
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,130
what else that I C %ah I was housed

224
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,419
on the same housing unit murderers

225
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,269
arsonists drug kingpins

226
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,279
organized crime figures at the time
there is a

227
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,480
a celebrated case in philadelphia big
organized crime

228
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,790
bust and I was held with the how those
fellows

229
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,589
was kinda interesting one thing I will
say that a person has a lot of

230
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,000
interesting people there

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,290
for better or worse I

232
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,149
I accidentally dropped a a garbage can
lid on the head is organized crime

233
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,410
family

234
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,709
one day of the second tier as as
throwing out the some banana peels I

235
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,339
sell me

236
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,559
kept leaving in in a Cell and I balance
the late on that on the legend

237
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,589
apparently fell off

238
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,759
10 feet hit the sky head I thought my
ear by troubles are over them

239
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,800
I was gonna be dead the next day and

240
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,170
he started screaming at me a Sicilian

241
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,029
his bodyguard their is also arrested
with him

242
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,249
intervened and said the I wasn't really

243
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:51,399
trying to hurt him attention that blew
over

244
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,180
that was a scary situation I

245
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,600
after a few months a going to various
hearings that were

246
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,790
basically unsuccessful getting out on
bail on

247
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,160
it looked as if the government had a
case against me

248
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,709
I did possess this stuff and there was
no no way around it

249
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,899
the worst no allegation I misuse this
material in any way

250
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,519
burning was what was this star the stuff
was a

251
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,290
a laptop computer software cables

252
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,410
I and then later they tack on another
charge possession at the touch tone

253
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,430
dialer

254
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,339
they had been modified sure that those
are the charges the charges were not

255
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,939
that I had used any this material in any
way shape or form

256
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:35,639
to commit any other crime there anything
unusual about this stuff that you had

257
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,089
well it was a not unusual anywhere in
this room probably

258
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,680
this is software that was available to
anyone that attended hope

259
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,009
your new york three years ago because I
gave their software free

260
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,910
awaited two people there even spoke
about issues

261
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,519
its it was could be you can be used to
have more than one telephone in the same

262
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,089
number

263
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,230
had one felony count you could have
several cellular phones on

264
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,730
it did not country with the government
Rd give you the ability to

265
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,610
steel telephone service from another
person because it didn't give you the it

266
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,199
didn't give

267
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,379
enable you to access someone else's
account its

268
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,079
but generally structural members but
that's another another subject

269
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,639
governments regulated it being
disingenuous when they represent

270
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,839
the factions cases house their sentences
so nothing was terribly unusual you

271
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,519
could buy any this stuff

272
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,559
really any computer electronics store
the software's rightly downloadable over

273
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,969
the Internet

274
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,300
I but a honestly a

275
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,050
called about a couple weeks before mine
my trial date

276
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,319
the my my attorney

277
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:44,740
well I spoke with on a pretty regular
basis told me that the prosecuting

278
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,269
attorney

279
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,709
US Attorney in my case confided in him

280
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,399
that the real reason that I was in jail
was not because of crystals or

281
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,579
laptop computers are telephone dialers

282
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,839
I was because of what they found in my
personal files

283
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,230
home which consisted hundreds of
subjects

284
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,409
one file folder which contained
information about the United States

285
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:08,899
Secret Service

286
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:12,050
and that was set that included
photographs or some other undercover

287
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,339
agents

288
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,948
on I'm sure the Philadelphia area

289
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,819
this photograph shoulda some months
before ended up on television

290
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,618
after I took them to 2600 meeting and

291
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:28,220
fox television news crew showed up in
broadcast them on the air

292
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,629
we thought it was kinda funny at the
time guess the secret service didn't

293
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,040
want the pictures had wanted the agents

294
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,710
picking their nose it's available on the
2600 website

295
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,809
are you were arrested in was right Mar
Mar 15

296
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,280
1995 1995 and my dad about

297
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,290
release you have been sentenced to how
long for the offensive having that

298
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,250
technology

299
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,619
well the statutory maximum is 15 years
in prison

300
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,820
for this but the the guidelines

301
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,530
a few years ago the the federal judges
were constrained as farr's

302
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,450
their flexibility what they could send
people to on because

303
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,490
I guess house and senate republicans
were upset

304
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,929
people were getting out earlier than
they should in some cases

305
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,369
a they had some truth in sentencing
legislation passed

306
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:20,408
which basically said that to US

307
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,369
the governmental put together a book
with guideline to the judges have to

308
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:24,908
follow

309
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,070
like in certain circumstances that
sentence has to be this long

310
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,928
short sort of thing and the statute was
charged with

311
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,230
even though it was a brand new statute
was a first-person country

312
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,520
charged with violating it on it was

313
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,700
it's called the fraud statute but
because there is no

314
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,020
fraud alleged to have occurred I

315
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,418
the government admitted in in there
reports that there were no victims in

316
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,440
the case

317
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,909
on there's no money involved at all
because it was a fraud case in there is

318
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,330
no money involved

319
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,869
the maximum time they could have given
me six months zero to six months

320
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,250
range it was in the sentencing
guidelines so six months

321
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,520
head to come and gone and

322
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,899
psych Here I am past but the government
recommends I could

323
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,619
the government setting guidelines say
should be in for so up

324
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,730
I had evidence suppression hearing
because I feel some other evidence was

325
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,300
seized illegally

326
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,580
I but that was struck down and %uh the
next ace

327
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,399
my lawyer said listen the wind is just
not going the right way you're better

328
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,260
off

329
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,330
pleading guilty to violating the statue

330
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,550
%ah but will make a special be called is
uniquely

331
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,649
which will allow you to withdraw the
guilty plea

332
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:38,030
which is very high difficult are
possible to do in federal cases they

333
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,050
usually 12

334
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,178
a guilty pleas edged down by

335
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,600
because it is a new statue on and I was

336
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,409
arguing that the the wording of the
statute which is very basic

337
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,790
was so big it was unconstitutionally
vague need it didn't specify what

338
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,629
conduct is really being prohibited

339
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:58,250
specify modified or altered manage

340
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,639
or but a telecommunications device wiser
even who had the

341
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:05,100
who had the power to shape what his
authorized was not authorized

342
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,059
insofar as access to telecommunications
services

343
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:13,610
so we're I pled guilty on

344
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,490
with the understanding I could withdraw
my plea in finally

345
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,649
a challenge in the third circuit

346
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,940
and for some reason

347
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,590
I wasn't what sent straight away to my
time served I end up spending another

348
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,139
month in prison

349
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,510
and it turns out that to when I finally
did

350
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,500
go before the judge for sentencing the
government was arguing that

351
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,119
because the offense involved more than
minimal planning

352
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,720
according to them that I deserve an
additional enhancement to that sentence

353
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,659
the federal sentencing guidelines is all
these enhancements like there's a gun

354
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:49,540
involved

355
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,908
is an enhancement I have now come to my
house was an issue

356
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,470
on there's like 20-30 enhancements they
have a call

357
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,169
nice work I one of them is if there's
more than one victim

358
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,919
multiple victims or if there was more
than Animal Planet in the offense

359
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,379
no victims they said they were no
victims up

360
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:10,760
that you can get to an additional two
months tacked on your sense

361
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,299
well turns out that all the planning
that they said was

362
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,830
involved in my offense occurred prior to
the enactment of the legislation that I

363
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,408
was

364
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,629
charged with violating but still a judge
bought the argument and I

365
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:26,540
received a seven-month sentence so I
serve the extra time

366
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,760
and and was released but to

367
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,730
and your troubles are over well I
thought they were

368
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,149
unfortunately about three years two
years before that I

369
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,960
I was convicted of a misdemeanor in a
small town

370
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,129
couple hours in philadelphia misdemeanor
was a

371
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:47,580
as a tamper with evidence charges
involved I was

372
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,059
with couple friends we are questioned by
police about a

373
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,678
tone dialer they were in in our
possession

374
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,590
and we were released but after we were
released

375
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,720
I'm the police discovered that the that
instruction sheets on how to make the

376
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,580
stand up to

377
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,080
modify these ten dollars disappeared

378
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,699
and they want to know what happened to
them the batteries disappear to

379
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,369
I that thing Greg Heffer few months back
in 92 and 93 and I

380
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,689
eventually pled no contest to it was not
i remove the structure

381
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,860
she to the batteries but I was not about
to

382
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,820
rat out my two friends to acquaintances
with me at the time

383
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,250
bernie i 282 rushing through this but we
we do have other these together

384
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,250
but basically what happened was a secret
service found out about this

385
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,320
yeah I have this money thing I have a
few years ago they use that

386
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,599
to to to say that you had violated your
probation by playing

387
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,300
arrested in 1995 the federal the federal
conviction constitute a violation of

388
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,589
probation for that previous misdemeanor
charge

389
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:54,980
and estate guide and was that in that
situation

390
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,109
because it was such a minor misdemeanor
charge you should just get probation

391
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,439
again are up to three months in prison

392
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,320
but the Secret Service showed up at this
small town courtroom

393
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,928
and said a lot of things that made me
sound like a

394
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:11,950
in the words of the judge one step above
a terrorist

395
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,230
and that's that's what the judge said I

396
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,099
does that mean you're more dangerous
return I was trying to figure that out

397
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,849
whether that meant I was like more
dangers in paris a slightly less

398
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,470
dangerous than a terrorist but

399
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,070
enough in a case make what impact on the
judge because those are his words that

400
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,970
he said that the secret service paid me

401
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,129
is being sent to one step above the
Paris

402
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:34,740
another's nothing dangerous found in my
house joining the could be conceived

403
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,220
sincerely dangerous was what the secret
service described c4 plastic explosives

404
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,679
which they admit it turned out to be
dental buddy because the previous owner

405
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,520
the house

406
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,119
turned out to be a dentist there's all
these all things in the basement

407
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,839
on but they said while Secret Service
claimed that while

408
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,070
it it tested not it tested not

409
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,510
she for the fact that it might have been
concern them greatly

410
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,480
a lot of other misrepresentations like
that so I received 26 to 24 months

411
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,159
additional sentence for

412
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,750
I for this a tampered with evidence
charge which the

413
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,070
District Attorney up there said party
concerned there's was a victimless crime

414
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,070
the disappearances instruction sheets
the same kinda structure she said her

415
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,200
now printed 2600 magazine

416
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,460
and on the Internet and

417
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,490
after that I was transferred to various
other maximum security facilities that

418
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,560
the strange thing in my case is that I
was I was sent around

419
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,790
into five different maximum-security
prisons

420
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,990
at that point up when is rehearsal ready
for that next year to charge

421
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,570
which in and severity scale is
equivalent to scattering rubbish

422
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,619
Pennsylvania as farce the crime scoring

423
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,050
I might bail was set at two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars

424
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,040
cash bail on cash bail that means you
can't at 10 percent security force was

425
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,349
really the equivalent of

426
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:58,399
two-and-a-half million dollars bail

427
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,700
for what did setting guidelines called
for

428
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,310
probation on but the secret service
apparently has a lot of influence over

429
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,889
over judges especially judges in small
towns

430
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:15,570
and the Secret Service aka to get banja
influence in

431
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,770
managed to get me sent to not only a

432
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,080
fairly fairly a

433
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,879
bad County Prison but but

434
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,230
because my bail was set at the
equivalent of two and a half million

435
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,950
dollars lock in the same

436
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,220
small wing with the multiple murderers
and and rapists in some

437
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,690
really nasty characters so a that began
another whole ordeal I wanted I was then

438
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,320
later transferred to two or three other

439
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,820
maximum security facilities and near the
end of that whole thing I

440
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,100
something happened that I discussed just
remember the details about to

441
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,020
idea I filed a various reasons I filed a
grievance against the

442
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,350
system work it one of these facilities
for a violation

443
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:06,710
my rights in one situation and as a
result of doing that center facing the

444
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,780
facts in the case

445
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,889
that work happy transfer to a like the
Supermax facility up in

446
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,140
Allentown Pennsylvania where in less
than 12 hours

447
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,059
I was severely beaten and by another
inmate who just been locked up

448
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,940
and I think Secret Service orchestrated
ap the fact that I was sent to a

449
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,500
this extremely high-security facility

450
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,190
on I think it's something to do with it
I spent seven hours

451
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,130
major surgery had a fifty two stitches

452
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,809
station to me I

453
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,809
at a titanium bar in my left arm now
multiple pieces of metal in my job which

454
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,240
was fractured in three places

455
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,370
and while you were being operated on you
are you were handcuffed to the hospital

456
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,660
bed

457
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,580
I was not only handcuff my ankles were
shackled to the to the gurney

458
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,030
in the operating room I am and I

459
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,320
that's the last thing I remember for a I
went unconscious after the year

460
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,809
after the general after the year general
anesthesia

461
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:08,410
and when I woke up house now the next
day

462
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,880
after coming out other comma like
condition that general anesthesia

463
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,280
gives you but %um I was

464
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,928
I found myself also still handcuffed and
shackled to

465
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,290
to the gurney recovery room

466
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,200
so I couldn't even adjust the year

467
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,290
them oxygen mask that was on my faced
like was like managing my nose because I

468
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:32,600
was

469
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,040
shackled handcuffed in car didn't seem
very responsive as far as my

470
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,110
hi complaints he was just more interest
in watching a sitcoms on the TV

471
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,460
and playing the very loudly which
prevented me from

472
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,330
from sleeping after I awoke at my
anesthesia

473
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,439
but to the nurses felt that they
couldn't do much about it because he was

474
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,309
prison guard

475
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,490
it would wanted so

476
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,020
at that point I your magazine

477
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,030
your readers and listeners to radio
program I think that's so upset about

478
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,020
what's happening

479
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,679
data %uh the campaign that you help me
now

480
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,370
specially got here at least I was
already passed my parole date at that

481
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,030
point but had been interviewed yet for
some mysterious reason

482
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,408
and I think for one for those injuries I
would have gotten out when I did

483
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:28,909
on the the a protest that were planned
in the

484
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,549
tore into faxes and phone calls to

485
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:38,950
prison officials in politicians the that
were working at Park Pennsylvania

486
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,340
I think played a big part in in the
judge signing an emergency order that by

487
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,190
really at release for medical reasons my
jaws were wired shut

488
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,220
I couldn't speak could eat food ahead to

489
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,980
drip liquids into my mouth and let them
see

490
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,740
through the gaps in my teeth om mind
right after surgery a

491
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,650
on after getting a hospital and thrown
into it infectious disease word in the

492
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,169
prison

493
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:06,380
where it was a regular season hepatitis
or

494
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,980
routinely held I didn't know that broken
jaws an armature

495
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,080
infectious early senator contagious are

496
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,189
the a prison officials apparently but
everybody the same same category that

497
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,490
way

498
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,909
are I wasn't given a painter the
hospital I was on morphine

499
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:27,530
for one day and taken back to the prison
and

500
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,700
against both my surgeon's orders I was
not given any pain medication and a

501
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,960
I think that was the worst part of my
experiences remember lying in bed

502
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,440
with multiple fractures I'll without any
pain reliever

503
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,890
and a I learned the true meaning
physical pain

504
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,380
then on get pretty depressed into

505
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,669
as i couldn't. the guards would bring
the solid food

506
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,679
the first night they brought me a
stuffed pepper key

507
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,909
and a I couldn't even E

508
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:02,290
%ah because the pain but to even if I
had any appetite which I can

509
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,168
is no way I could a stuffed pepper my
guys were completely wired shut the best

510
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:07,340
I could do is a

511
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,850
sip like chicken broth and it was a it
was a full 24 hours before they brought

512
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,179
many

513
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:17,350
liquid food so and he was about a week
at week or so after that

514
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,290
your your efforts and the efforts have
I'll your listeners to radio programming

515
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,360
and readers your magazine India mailing
list in his crib you set up

516
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,000
on making up the impact to get me
released

517
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,320
so I was released and took me about a
monster recover from a

518
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,580
not totally recover I can't is about as
much as I can straighten my left arm out

519
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,240
Street other RF thats as for the
titanium bar isn't that where the joins

520
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,000
damaged and i cant open my mouth is much
as I

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,370
would like to but on glad to be alive
and i'm glad to be out

522
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,970
and I'm happily living in Philadelphia
now

523
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,550
have a good job have a nice apartment
and trying to put this whole thing

524
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,139
behind me but

525
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,840
what I'm what I'm afraid of most is this
happening to someone else

526
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,260
on be incarcerated going to hell I went
through for

527
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,429
up something the government admitted
there were no victims in

528
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,880
not one dime's worth the fraud occurring
in for the real reason

529
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,490
as you embarrassed Secret Service agents
ya this

530
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,290
this again was not was was confirmed by
prosecuting attorney

531
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,389
told my attorney my turning worked with
this prosecutor

532
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,530
as a federal prosecutor himself for four
years huh

533
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,090
after four years I think he saw the
light became a defense attorney

534
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,460
my turning also is a very good
reputation he argued

535
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,350
successfully argued a case for the
United States pertz Supreme Court

536
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,470
one time also so these Noah first
attorney was terrible

537
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,659
fired him the this attorney that I had a
couple months into my case

538
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,799
canister he allowed a Philadelphia
submissive really good attorney

539
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,700
and his argument again was that a
challenge constitutionally a

540
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,320
constitutionality of the law which we
did but unfortunately he said he had

541
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,139
the appeal he filed had to be kind of a
bare-bones

542
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,530
up appeal because he didn't have the
financial resources and you did I

543
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,559
to put his full staff on him I'm

544
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,520
one thing you'll learn if you ever go
through a federal ready have other

545
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,350
criminal case

546
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,559
especially federal you need a lot of
money

547
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,940
I'm when I'm seeing a lot of money you
need on the order of tens of thousands

548
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,270
of dollars

549
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,899
to mount an effective campaign the
government

550
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:35,500
usually spends that much money
prosecuting the case if not more

551
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,880
on at your tax money on and they have

552
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,770
now the best expert witnesses that money
can buy

553
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,290
and in order to combat those witnesses
you have to hire an expert witnesses

554
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,908
which are very expensive

555
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,659
on you need to have a staff

556
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:56,669
technically well-versed I lawyers

557
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:59,929
to go over all the case law in my case
there is very little case law to give

558
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,820
the first person country charger this
thing

559
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,780
by Tom bottom line is my appeal was
turned down

560
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,540
because a as my lawyer explain to me
said a a

561
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,240
rubber-stamped this followed the the
government argument

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,540
whole he said this followed a whole to
I'd like to make that

563
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,570
that appeal available to people

564
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,389
okay to I get most on the internet
sometime soon goes and a lot other

565
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,549
details of why the statute is so big

566
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,580
literally be used selectively

567
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,919
to probably archery

568
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,720
most the people in this room I'm not
saying it's gonna happen in fact I

569
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,799
I don't think it's going to happen on
but when you have a big lot like that

570
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,010
it opens possibility for abuse

571
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,260
and in my case with the secret service
according to Mike

572
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,419
prosecutor who confided mind turning
this she was heavily pressured by the

573
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:59,600
secret service to vigorously prosecute
this case

574
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,190
and she said the real reason I was in
prison was again because I information I

575
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,450
had in my files

576
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,690
a also to secret service agents visited
visit the individual who gave me these

577
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,389
photographs

578
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,870
I'm told him and although about them

579
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,060
I'm nobody fucks with the secret service
without us fucking with them

580
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,139
and with two thousand agents with the
biggest gang in town

581
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,020
and that's a quote up individual game is
photographs that he was visited

582
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,550
and that's what they told him so he
closes business move to California

583
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,730
and they didn't charge him fortunately
the all he did was give me some

584
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,980
photographs

585
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,230
that's a whole nother story sorry we I i
think all of us here feel

586
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,609
that we're very fortunate to have you
here with us

587
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:49,270
after all that I really doubt I would
have been able to maintain my sanity

588
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,560
on I went to appear depression wallace
et incarcerated specially after

589
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,060
my injuries and if I didn't know that a
lot of people didn't care

590
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,450
or send an email I time to hang in there
that they're following my case

591
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,060
I i probably would have gone into an
abyss that I might not have ever climbed

592
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,450
outta

593
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,220
so I was looking at some idea pronounce
you to

594
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,250
you given me over the newsgroup

595
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,920
postings and idea

596
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,210
actually shed a couplet here's lookin at
over that stuff couple a days ago I

597
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,530
I kinda show all this stuff is just so
painful the on the whole situation I

598
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,660
don't think about it much

599
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,700
try to and forget about the whole
experience but the

600
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,900
preparing for for this conference site
that all the stuff that started reading

601
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,660
and i was just so touched

602
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,480
the people fell so strongly about what
was happening

603
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,010
is being wrong and I'm never gonna
forget that

604
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,020
on thats one thing I can tell people a

605
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,080
if you know anyone who's going through
something like this they're gonna need

606
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,589
all the support moral

607
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:51,299
emotional support you can muster because
a

608
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,750
it's a it's a rough experience to go
through its act like

609
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,510
best description I could manage to come
up with for your radio program once was

610
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,620
a

611
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,370
it's like a combination ever Alice in
Wonderland and Franz Kafka

612
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,790
because nothing in there in the world at
the criminal justice system

613
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,960
really is logical on logic compassion
and common sense

614
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,890
simply are even part the equation on

615
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,750
and that doesn't seem to make sense to
you then just ask someone who's gone

616
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,569
through it

617
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:22,710
and they'll I'll tell you the same thing

618
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,750
so thank you everybody all the people
who

619
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,210
followed my case who wrote me who didn't
write new

620
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,300
where there's there for me morally

621
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,700
just private all the good vibes you sent
me I think

622
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,200
got through those thick steel walls

623
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,200
and it made a difference for me thank
you very much

624
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:53,900
bernie we're gonna put you on hold just
a little bit there is a third case

625
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,530
tonight to discuss

626
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,309
and I believe is still there okay

627
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:03,140
fiberoptic is to my right I

628
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,490
fiber here thank you

629
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,210

Conference

630
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,329
fiber-optic was in prison are still very
badly having a conference without him

631
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,540
being able to attend

632
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,660
and we're frightened a little bit by
having him

633
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,828
not call us live for the first time are
in the closing night at that conference

634
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,670

ask some questions things like that this

635
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,140

I was about 9 no I went wrong

642
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:58,230
when in phnom January

643
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,730
1990 with was probably the turning point
vans

644
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,109
on on January 24th

645
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:10,240
I remember thats Ning I was coming home
from

646
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,970
an internship had high school saying out
with a friend the mine

647
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:21,440
actually a buncha friends of mine from
from my love my old neighborhood where

648
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,770
my parents live in Queens and

649
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,609
on my friend said are some really
strange is going on around

650
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:31,839
around your house is our all these fans

651
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,529
cars pulled up are in the front around
the back

652
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:41,630
so I thought that was kinda hot that
eventually I one home

653
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,549
on was was about dinner time in its
kinda hungry and I walked in the door

654
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:50,040
and I didn't see anybody and I walked
into the kitchen

655
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,869
and by my mom was on the telephone and

656
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:57,990
before I could ask her what you know was
going on

657
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,160
there was a a knock on the door and so

658
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,750
I walked back to the front door open the
door and was

659
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,319
there were some secret service agent
person's body feeling the doorway

660
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,420
on explaining that on they had I'll

661
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,849
already others seized all my things and
that they wanted to question me

662
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,319
waiting outside arm they came and the

663
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,540
proceeded to a sit-down

664
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,779
with a couple people from on nynex

665
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,140
an individual from from bellcore

666
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,308
New Jersey on and

667
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,849
my my parents were really upset

668
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,170
they were trying to a question meow 17

669
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,049
time I was I was a minor and on

670
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:52,220
I obviously didn't have any any attorney
present I'll

671
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,069
from what I could tell what they were
saying

672
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:59,779
before my parents ask them to leave was

673
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,599
there where the fact that I and a

674
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,480
broke into various systems with than
nynex

675
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,119
switching systems things that nature

676
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,089
that %uh they were really upset about
and

677
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:19,779
as far as the Belcourt guy I think he
was just there as

678
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,030
on-site expert looking over things

679
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,319
so there with so they knew what they
were taking or something like that arm

680
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,630
although I actually

681
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,690
had access to bellcore machines in

682
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,799
in the mid-eighties I was never actually
charged for it brown

683
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,829
I mean they they had all that evidence

684
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:45,250
me that shows the charge me with
whatever I guess they thought was

685
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,260
was gonna stick on the interesting thing
was saddam

686
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,190
they accused me of having crash the AT&T
long-distance network which

687
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,650
at that time had never happened before
fortunately since then it's happened

688
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,010
about three more times

689
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,119
I'll or I guess unfortunately the
pending your long distance company

690
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,109
years but at that time and it never
happened before

691
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:13,270
so they were they were really upset
about it all worked up

692
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,700
it was it was

693
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,910
I think around our january 15 1990

694
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,529
are around Martin Luther King Day that
actually happened

695
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,990
and AT&T soon afterwards

696
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,720
made it known that it was their own
screw-up

697
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,250
the the secret service to really
acknowledge that

698
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,480
back so they were they're accusing me of
having caused millions of dollars worth

699
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,740
of damage

700
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,130
the cap every time we asked them they
would make up a different dollar amount

701
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,310
so

702
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,690
became pretty apparent that really know

703
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,690
why they were there what they were
talking about

704
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,329
the obviously the people people that
knew the most about what was going on

705
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:57,880
we're

706
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,619
where the the people from nynex bellcore

707
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,000
by Tom they didn't really ask me is

708
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,329
nearly as many questions as they
probably wouldn't want to

709
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:13,410
which was lucky for me because

710
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,078
it its it's an unfortunate

711
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,460
major response that out when you're

712
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,869
when you're doing all this stuff we
finally meet the people

713
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,299
that are behind it your first reaction
is a wanna tell them everything

714
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:32,270
because you want to know where where
everything screwed up

715
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:36,210
so the prolly obvious problem with that
is that you

716
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,720
you go to medically incriminate yourself
in all kinds of horrible

717
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,579
ways so fortunately they didn't get the
chance to ask

718
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:51,579
to questions and so I did I didn't end
up incriminating myself

719
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,869
the they left us with really be copy

720
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,140
all the things that the intake which you
know is basically

721
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:06,578
anything conceivable might possibly be
electronic

722
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,079
including things that they perceive to
be

723
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,730
storage medium including videotapes

724
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:18,869
things like sedatives I'll

725
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:22,060
I I got a hold of

726
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,680
couple the the other guys that I was
actually

727
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,520
involved in the these activities find
out what happened

728
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,579
the same things simultaneously in fact

729
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,920
the the agents conducting these

730
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,060
searches and seizures call each other

731
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,839
from between the house is actually a
synchronized re

732
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,009
as they were concerned that we would
notify the other

733
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,950
that this was happening

734
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,270
it was that was that was a pretty

735
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,299
harrowing experience but it was also

736
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:05,509
pretty confusing experience because
rather young at the time

737
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,310
we didn't really know what to make

738
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,910
there was a lot of media exposure at a
time

739
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,759
when hackers we're really getting

740
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,089
very very much media attention nearly as
much as the

741
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:24,960
today soul all this as a whole

742
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,740
in general released or for for attention

743
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,829
to to just get get the word out about
what it is we do

744
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:36,760
who you are so in some ways

745
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,890
I think we saw getting getting

746
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,270
busted as an opportunity to tell our
story

747
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,509
and unfortunately in a lotta ways that

748
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,529
that worked against us because

749
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:54,559
the the media was was really highest

750
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:00,630
direction the government

751
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:07,600
excuse me

752
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,120
what what ended up happening is as
anybody else here

753
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,319
home i'm talking likewise it coming

754
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,940
talking on charges the homily or serious

755
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,920
okay

756
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,970
we might be the only ones here in arms
okay

757
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:37,970
a truck like anyway

758
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,420
after they left we basically didn't hear
from them for for another year

759
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,920
and what happened in the process since

760
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,030
I was a minor the

761
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,870
they dropped it they dropped the charges
to

762
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,920
state charge and the state charge

763
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,570
was I don't even remember what it was

764
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:08,660
was it was say it was something really
minor it was a

765
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,029
it was a misdemeanor and I was charged
as a youthful offender

766
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,680
I'll and

767
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,220
I was basically order to do I think it
was something like thirty hours a

768
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,320
community service

769
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,390
something minor and it was over and done
with

770
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,970
fairly quickly now

771
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:35,810
that year year 1991

772
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,370
really the whole time after what
initially

773
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,680
happen we were so involved in what

774
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,279
was that we were doing and we were so
convinced that

775
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,690
since we had just been busted that

776
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,090
we know everything that they could
possibly do to us

777
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,530
so it was almost as if we were I'll let
into a false sense of relief

778
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:04,550
it's like you you you know you for 10
years you're living on the edges

779
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:08,880
as a little kid you figure you know it
any given moment you know there could be

780
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,460
a knock on the door

781
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,630
hours you know some some federal agents
might Austin and then all the sudden

782
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,150
it actually happens it's it's almost
psychologically it's almost like you

783
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,180
convince yourself

784
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,940
okay now the worst is over I can go back
to what I was doing before this app

785
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,670
so essentially

786
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:33,870
we changed through to a certain degree
we changed our

787
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:38,980
method of operation and redirect our
focus

788
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,510
on slightly different evers and for the
following year 1991

789
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:51,370
we were extremely successful was towards
the

790
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,850
towards the end the day year trouble

791
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:59,240
be surfaced and it was actually the day
before Pearl Harbor Day

792
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,600
December 6 1991

793
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,260
I'll the I it was

794
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,480
peculiar night I remember

795
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,320
home going to sleep in about 45 morning

796
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,410
it was the winter so still dark and the

797
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:24,149
the neighbors dogs we're making a lot of
noise neighbor's car alarm back driveway

798
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,740
my parents house kept going off that was
kinda peculiar

799
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,880
but nothing out of the ordinary so
anyway I went to sleep

800
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,790
and I just past episodes really tired

801
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,960
enough packing and

802
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,490
in the morning about

803
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,530
I think about ten or eleven o'clock in
the morning home

804
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,360
strangest thing happened I was

805
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,090
I was awoken by two FBI agents

806
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,310
guns drawn my room the

807
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:03,930
they didn't seem very amused but the
worst part is that I didn't really take

808
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,430
them very seriously initially

809
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,649
tried to go back to sleep figure that
cast

810
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,630
just completely ridiculous that
something like that could be happening

811
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,940
by Tom they

812
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,510
they weren't really amused and the

813
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,500
the poll the they pull the covers off me

814
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,480
people the sheets of and II

815
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,960
normally sleep my underwears and they
they asked me if

816
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,010
if might appear pass I could throw on

817
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:41,400
an idea motion across the room still
half awake

818
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,860
touched me a pair jeans on and the

819
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,760
the March me down the stairs and on my
way down

820
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,620
down the stairs I noticed that the house

821
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,279
was field with scurrying agents like
cockroaches

822
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,550
they were FBI and Secret Service agents

823
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,890
scurrying in an outer every room on

824
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,960
every four it was it was unbelievable

825
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,420
it was it was like ET was dying my
parents house

826
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,900
there was there were just they were
everywhere it was like they had its

827
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,280
sealed off apparently what happened arm

828
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,510
I never heard coming is they entered
through the back door

829
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,880
went through my parents backyard me in a
battering ram

830
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,970
and they they literally just busted in
the back door

831
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,310
and snuck upstairs sure very quietly

832
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,000
even though they claim that they knocked
no one answered and the perceived

833
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,210
the break I'll which which is

834
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,180
always the case by Tom

835
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:52,180
they are

836
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,640
media at this point Eric

837
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,440
and want them handed me a copy

838
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,300
while the

839
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,609
the indictment was still happening
rather well this

840
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:42,210
press conference still happen arm mean

841
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:47,080
me in a couple friends went over to want
the federal buildings where the

842
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,810
where they assign com legal counsel
which

843
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:57,490
in the federal systems is slightly
different from

844
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,940
from public defender

845
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,190
its it's similar but its a higher
classifications

846
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:09,650
attorney which is provided through
what's known as the Criminal Justice Act

847
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:13,070
because at that time I was I was 18

848
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,740
certainly wasn't working money to hire
turn home

849
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,380
we went over to the building and now
want to apply for

850
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,490
for a court-appointed attorney and the

851
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,910
the person behind the desk couldn't find
any record

852
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:35,379
the fact that I was in any kind of legal
trouble whatsoever

853
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,730
was questioning why in fact I was I was

854
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:43,800
registering myself for legally and I was
trying to explain to her that

855
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,410
I was at this very moment being indicted
in the building

856
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,920
right across the way and down that only
confuse er

857
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,240
it was just didn't work out so

858
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,280
we went back to the building where they
were holding the press conference

859
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,849
we could hear what they were saying and
a lot of media people just didn't

860
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,780
understand why this was such a big deal

861
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:13,200
needed I really year the government was
trying to make it sound like it was

862
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,540
it was the end of the world by Tom

863
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,540
the the media was really looking for
where the actual

864
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,609
damage which there was any any

865
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:27,830
any real conceivable damage others me
other than maybe

866
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,848
damage to the Pride corporations and arm

867
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:36,390
so so at the at the end to the press
conference

868
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,940
want the people that walked over to me
actually turned out to be

869
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,609
the the assistant US Attorney his cards

870
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:50,130
to get in touch with them also

871
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:55,460
your secret service agent in charge in
the case also came over and said

872
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,599
I that they were given they were giving
me the option

873
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:06,430
to surrender myself and that the they
were gonna take me into custody

874
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,820
because I was not apparently I was a
violent person

875
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:15,130
or so they thought so

876
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,500
I got got in touch with whoever else
wasn't there

877
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,790
was aware that all this is happening and
I told them basically that we had to use

878
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:26,410
surrender ourselves or else they were
gonna come after us arm

879
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:30,230
by a given date which i think was with
was within a week

880
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,330
basically had to go down

881
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,339
have our own free will get processed by

882
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:41,040
the Secret Service at secret service
headquarters which is six World Trade

883
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,460
Center

884
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:46,050
by we have to get processed by the FBI

885
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,300
which you don't actually go to the FBI
headquarters

886
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,910
which I could tell you where it is but
they probably would like that very much

887
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:56,899
because people normally go there or
rather people aren't supposed to know

888
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,619
where it is

889
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:03,760
I'll but the FBI actually has you
processed by the US Marshals so

890
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,210
and the US Marshals actually in the
basement court building and so

891
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:13,710
when I see process they mean you're
basically fingerprinted and photographed

892
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,619
nonsense the

893
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:20,940
the funny thing is when I wanted to be
processed

894
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,180
in the US Marshal's Office home

895
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,609
this was around the time that they had
just caught

896
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:34,098
the the guys who had bombed the World
Trade Center and

897
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:38,310
they were waiting in there too so I'm
basically standing there

898
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:41,880
and there's like you know there's these
half-dozen Arab guys

899
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,300
better just you know babbling to each
other in

900
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,140
you now Arabic and it just looking at me

901
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,290
like you know like like I should I for
some reason

902
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,560
I guess because I wasn't I wasn't
islamic urs

903
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,220
arm and now so that made me feel really
uncomfortable but there's

904
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:06,290
again there's something really surreal
about

905
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,290
so eventually they they took them and

906
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,640
they took them into a cell and

907
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,720
they they seem to be completely
indifferent

908
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:23,710
on

909
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,880
and Om ultimately I was

910
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,910
I was fingerprinted

911
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:34,450
and photographed and then

912
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,040
released M&

913
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,660
some time it passed

914
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:47,259
and so I'm really thirsty

915
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:54,010
arm

916
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:59,450
some time past after their trying to
remember exactly

917
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,309
how much time like

918
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:08,940
on sale

919
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,750
whose throat is dry and me

920
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:17,420
it's really trying

921
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,370
units in water I got some water over
here okay

922
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:27,370
just goes on some choking are

923
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:31,060
if you could see free a whole person
career the next

924
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,610
three minutes the really nice because we
think questions

925
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:38,040
all right let's let delivered

926
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,940
arm which basically what I was getting
too

927
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,350
is that %uh some time it passed we were
notified by mail

928
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:51,610
bus home we were

929
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:55,670
okay I got to the indictment part we
were indicted we were processed

930
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:59,310
arm we went through the whole mass

931
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,779
initially some of us want to go to trial

932
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,500
others that were wanted from work counts
in the indictment did not want to go to

933
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,060
trial

934
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,490
so we were immediately

935
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:16,370
divided amongst ourselves on is
obviously those of us with only one or

936
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:17,500
two charges did

937
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,400
10 arm surly be held under

938
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,930
the held under the the same

939
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:29,310
responsibility for

940
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:32,480
for what happened as as the people that
were charged with with

941
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,980
the bulk at the end I so

942
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,310
that that really divided us and i got
really ugly

943
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:43,860
after a while I was the only remaining
person would not plead guilty

944
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:47,000
an was preparing to go to trial just

945
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,600
ultimately just threw in the towel
because I

946
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,720
had weighed the risk had gotten all the
discovery material provided to me

947
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,120
over all the evidence that was collected
and

948
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,920
I just said that I was facing a
conspiracy charge

949
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,490
which carried a two to five years in
prison a quarter million dollars in

950
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:10,240
fines

951
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,720
and in addition to that I was facing a
second charge on authorized access to

952
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,260
federal interest computers

953
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:21,270
which was also a felony and carry the
same penalty 25 years and two hundred

954
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,020
fifty thousand dollars in fines

955
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:28,990
so mom even if I was able to convince
the jury

956
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:34,150
that one of those things wasn't true and
they convicted me the other

957
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,700
then I would still go to go to prison
for five years

958
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,700
and I would be a really poor man my god

959
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,130
so their really didn't see mars

960
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:48,220
so ultimately I ended up pleading guilty

961
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:52,430
Obama was notified by mail along with
everyone else

962
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,190
when we were supposed to report to
prison and basically

963
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:01,260
of course this is assuming that we were
already sentenced which we were

964
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,610
and I was quickly sentence

965
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:09,230
to a year and a day 600 hours community
service

966
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:14,030
three years supervised release and Dom

967
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,220
I was supposed to report to prison

968
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,350
in I believe it was nineteen ninety-four

969
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:26,480
in our January 1994 and the irony the
whole thing

970
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,480
is we went out and state attorneys that
weekend and we can ever imagine

971
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,770
we never would have imagined at that
time

972
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,540
that one day I would be free and Bernie
would be in prison

973
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,690
bomb never really crossed our minds

974
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,650
by Tom basically me in a manual on a
couple other

975
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:54,100
friends arm drove out weekend at
Bernie's exactly

976
01:05:54,100 --> 01:06:00,580
I am yeah

977
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,759
there were some there's a great
snowstorm I stores

978
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,140
great great and terrible icestorm that

979
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,509
swept through Philadelphia and it was

980
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,790
it was amazing because they were just
blankets

981
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:18,750
ice on everything cars they didn't even
look like ours anymore they just look

982
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,070
like

983
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,440
lumps of I'll lump-sum snow and ice

984
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,600
and all the bushes and shrubs were
frozen solid

985
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,900
and the streets we're just sheets sheets
a vice

986
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,020
so that the crawl through the streets of
Philadelphia to

987
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:37,060
find a place stand upright separate the
governor to cleanest

988
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,470
declared a state of emergency said no
one

989
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,670
legally drive on the streets so we're am

990
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,900
we have a problem yeah fiber had to get
the prison

991
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,110
and the governor said you could fitted
had to

992
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:55,350
the real problem was I was supposed to
report to prison

993
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:00,330
and a particular date and now all the
roads were closed

994
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:03,750
and basically we

995
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,750
bernie & contact the prison household

996
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:10,980
the roads are closed hours how was I
supposed to

997
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,570
report to prison they said oh don't
worry just come come tomorrow

998
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,770
and the next day come tomorrow scum soon
as the roads are open

999
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:22,270
and we ended up actually getting there
sleep on

1000
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,450
I think it was either Friday or Saturday
night Saturday night

1001
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:29,400
yeah Anna unfortunately

1002
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,750
and something that they didn't reveal to
us

1003
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,380
was that a there's nobody

1004
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:40,290
to process you as

1005
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:45,290
ASI a new in me on the week so I was
actually

1006
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:49,009
taking into the the medium-security
prison

1007
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:52,520
combat is action that is attach to

1008
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,040
the the the present work camp that I was
supposed to go to

1009
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,759
arm and I was taken to our

1010
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,500
was taken to to a place known as the
whole which I'm sure you

1011
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,610
you've seen in movies on television the
only difference is that when you're put

1012
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,280
in the whole

1013
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,380
in real life your not naked there aren't
rats running

1014
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:19,650
will sometimes as rats running arm in
the place that I was out there were not

1015
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:23,250
but you not makin any not laying on the
floor in your own urine

1016
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:27,589
in the dark so that part is a little
different bottom

1017
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:33,700
it is it is equally as depressing and I
was in this isolation

1018
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:39,540
about Tom about a day-and-a-half

1019
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,589
which Tom I found the rather

1020
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:46,160
maddening Marcus the only thing you

1021
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,799
the only thing you really have to do is

1022
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:54,939
look at the halogen our spotlights
outside your really tiny window

1023
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,859
or you could read scratchings on the
wall that were made by

1024
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,080
some other unfortunate person who was
there before you

1025
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,960
arm and you can feel like you're in the

1026
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,399
The Twilight Zone episode where roddy
mcdowall is in the room that looks like

1027
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,100
a perfect replica

1028
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,430
like in nineteen sixties living room
except the

1029
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:20,279
they open up the front lawns people
looking in through PC class and he's

1030
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:20,730
actually

1031
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:25,470
as one of our planet on you kinda feel
like that because they feed you through

1032
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,170
a little hole in door

1033
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:33,399
they actually unlock and the shop a tray
of food through

1034
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:38,660
arm

1035
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:45,660
is

1036
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:19,820
thank you thank you

1037
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,900
that's good water arm still some left
outside

1038
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,180
okay well it's not I got a few more
gulps left's just very dry appear

1039
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,190
talking for so long

1040
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:33,340
anyway on where was I

1041
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:39,200
all being fed through a whole yahoo.com
so ultimately arm

1042
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,030
II I got the year the same carrots soon
that %uh bernie

1043
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:49,360
described and noms I was marched around
between buildings in the snow

1044
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,280
with with these really

1045
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,809
in rubber soled shoes was extremely call

1046
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:02,080
and I often joke around with friends in
mind because when you're

1047
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,390
you're actually stripped down naked when
you first get there

1048
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:08,970
hash I and wanna things that %uh

1049
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:13,330
that they that they ask well they they
do they tell you to do to really funny

1050
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,010
things

1051
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,100
with with your privates and %ah

1052
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,140
11 other things that they tell you in
this is the exact lingo that the use

1053
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:26,780
they tell you to lift your sack and then
they tell you to turn around and spread

1054
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,550
your cheeks

1055
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:31,010
and that which is something that makes
you feel extremely uncomfortable

1056
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,320
especially because

1057
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,740
other two guys telling you to do enter
hillbillies from

1058
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:42,740
from the mountains a Pennsylvania the so
long that was

1059
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,630
there was a very peculiar experience mom

1060
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:50,700
locally I

1061
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,050
I left the room with my manhood intact
and Dom

1062
01:11:54,050 --> 01:12:01,050
I was given a thank you high school I
was gonna fresh supply of water

1063
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:08,980
no i i was given a a I was given I was
given one of these %uh very same are

1064
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:09,950
carrots suits

1065
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,330
orange jumpsuit and I was sent to mom

1066
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,580
building to be photographed and Dom

1067
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:21,250
the really funny part was that it was a
polaroid camera

1068
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:25,070
which is the easiest cameras in the
world use because

1069
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:29,570
you load the film snapped the picture
you pull out the film

1070
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,710
you peel off the paper and you have
yourself a picture

1071
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:38,140
well for whatever reason these to
particularly swift channel man had

1072
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,440
horrible trouble doing this and Tom

1073
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,280
they succeeded in repeatedly putting the
film in

1074
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,110
backwards not having the camera plugged
in when they snapped the film pulled out

1075
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,710
the film and ripped the paper of

1076
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,950
to reveal a glove acid on the paper that

1077
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,070
didn't really look very much like me so
long

1078
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:02,670
I was I was in the the picture-taking
session for

1079
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,500
for quite some time ultimately they were
able to

1080
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,970
successfully photograph me our

1081
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:13,160
give me a number have me repeat the
number back to them

1082
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,420
which is my inmate number and %uh
fingerprint me

1083
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,820
and and the whole nine yards on and by
then it was probably

1084
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,620
II estimate about two or three in the
morning was getting pretty tired

1085
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:30,110
arm let's see

1086
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:35,259
what happened next mom well OK by

1087
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,930
by this time hours I was living in the
whole for the remainder the weekend

1088
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,420
after a been processed om

1089
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,530
after eating mom something that

1090
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:49,599
they claimed was food and because the
fact that I was

1091
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,860
I was already under on an incredible the
grief stress

1092
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:56,480
I'll on Monday morning

1093
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:01,050
late monday morning I wasn't feeling too
good so I decided I was gonna walk over

1094
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,940
to the toilet and proceed to vomit all
over it which made me feel a whole lot

1095
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,030
better at the time

1096
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:09,599
om and then I was

1097
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,850
I was sometime later I was escorted out
of

1098
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:18,050
at the whole and mom taken over to

1099
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:21,450
to some other building and given

1100
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:24,550
a a change a clothes because some

1101
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:28,980
in the in the in the prison camp you
don't actually where the

1102
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,070
the orange jumpsuit thing anymore you
wear on

1103
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:36,700
what looks like close that weren't good
enough to be used

1104
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,349
on gomer pyle because they they were

1105
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,510
they were effective for to cheaply made
or something

1106
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,810
bottom they're basically khaki shirts

1107
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:50,650
and khaki pants and %ah and some

1108
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:55,020
steel-toed boots which was the the
standard-issue

1109
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:59,020
prison where so mom I still have to
laugh when I

1110
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,850
when I see people in the street there
you know wearing levi's

1111
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:06,010
con Dockers or something like that
because I'd

1112
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:11,090
I think they look like they just came at
a prison it just looks ridiculous to me

1113
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,260
anywhere anybody wearing tan or khaki

1114
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,590
om but anyway arm that's that's what I

1115
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,930
you normally war one you were doing

1116
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,120
work or when when you

1117
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,430
when you headed visits from from the
outside

1118
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:31,060
otherwise you could you could you can
wear sweatpants

1119
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,280
which you had the purchase or wear
t-shirts and so on

1120
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,730
arm

1121
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:43,100
I guess this is where if things aren't
strange enough already this this is

1122
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:47,890
the point where things get really
strange because saddam

1123
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:51,470
prison life one actually refer to it as
life

1124
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:55,270
is extremely peculiar

1125
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:59,240
on there's there's this whole other
language that people use

1126
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,550
are in reference to various things that

1127
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:07,450
your either familiar or totally
unfamiliar with

1128
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,740
bomb some other language is actually

1129
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,269
hybrid I love that's really made up of
the

1130
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:18,210
the pre dominant com places that

1131
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:22,760
the majority of inmates are from for
example a lot a lot of the slain

1132
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,980
outspoken in prison is kind of a hybrid
between

1133
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:29,460
on New York City New Jersey on

1134
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,690
Philadelphia and now

1135
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:36,550
couple other places and confused
together along with this

1136
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:41,150
other long-standing prison lingo that
apparently people take with them when

1137
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,430
they're transferred

1138
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,580
from prison to prison and not some other
words or

1139
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:52,300
I guess prisoner mom coined by prisoners
but other terms apparently

1140
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,390
we rock coined by the Bureau of Prisons

1141
01:16:55,390 --> 01:17:00,370
an if you don't really pay attention
pretty soon you start to realize that

1142
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,240
a lot of these terms were were call were
were made up

1143
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,400
om with some kind of psychological
reasoning behind

1144
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,060
oMG like for I'm trying to think of some
really good examples

1145
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:16,090
om okay for let's say for example you're
having a problem

1146
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:20,180
with another inmate or with arm

1147
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:25,610
the the person that you're working for
or whatever wherever the problem maybe

1148
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:29,170
you are you fill out a form %uh and

1149
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:32,210
what this form is actually called it's
not as

1150
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:37,920
a cop-out and say okay a cop-out I need
to fill out a cop-out

1151
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,510
what am I am i copping out in some way I
don't really understand

1152
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:46,580
so there's like there's this really
weird psychological thing going on

1153
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,730
that's sorta subconsciously imposed upon
you the entire time

1154
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:54,120
there all not to mention

1155
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,690
com the fact that there are

1156
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:02,040
there are there what's known as accounts

1157
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,580
at at regular intervals I'm not counting

1158
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:10,500
emergency fog counts on council
basically headcounts

1159
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,710
where com everybody is to return to
their

1160
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:18,480
long and they have to be accounted for
an

1161
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,180
then you really see what type of person
actually qualifies for

1162
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:26,800
for for a for a corrections officer

1163
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,770
saddam the person who fail basic
arithmetic

1164
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,580
in kindergarten because some you'd be
surprised how many times they have to

1165
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,430
recount

1166
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:39,650
basically the way it works is they have

1167
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,820
to CEO's or what with the inmates call
them is

1168
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,860
ironically enough they call them hacks

1169
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,070
hace que es tax and Om

1170
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:53,540
I'm not really sure what the origin up
are up that is why they're called

1171
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:58,680
tax on I've heard some awesome really
playful

1172
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,210
acronyms what it could stand for one of
them is a huge asshole carrying

1173
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:08,410
keys eyes on such

1174
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:12,599
by Tom basically a couple the older guys
when I first got there

1175
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,630
took me and showed me the ropes about
you know things you need to know

1176
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:20,469
when you're in prison on for example you

1177
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:23,890
you learn very quickly that the only
thing that you're ever gonna

1178
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:27,830
year in prison that makes a jingling
noise is one of these

1179
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:31,280
huge assholes carrying keys so long

1180
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,250
you want to make sure that you're not
doing anything that you're not supposed

1181
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,260
to be doing

1182
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:39,790
are few by any chance happen to

1183
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:43,160
here the sounder Okies jingling

1184
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,500
on that something you learn right away
on there's

1185
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:51,560
this other other various things that are
there particularly strange that you

1186
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,920
that you you find out about right away

1187
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,210
that you wouldn't really assume on the
outside

1188
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,480
really make no sense arm for example

1189
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,660
its mortal sin are if you're

1190
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:08,099
in the dining hall to actually reach
over

1191
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,340
someone else's tray with food I can
never really figure out

1192
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,410
why that was the the only thing I can
think of

1193
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,610
is is maybe they're afraid that some
kind of like

1194
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,750
diseased flash was gonna fall of your
body

1195
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,310
into their food or something like that I
never leak and it could understand that

1196
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,300
but

1197
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,590
I don't know if it's some weird prison
superstition or

1198
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:32,590
something else just very strange

1199
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:36,400
arm I'm trying to think of a

1200
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,920
some the other thing else arm your

1201
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,170
familiarized with Tom there or

1202
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,110
if you ever have a problem which you
never should have a problem

1203
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:51,400
because basically anybody any inmate
does have a problem

1204
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,219
om is putting themselves at risk as
trouble-maker

1205
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:58,790
and somebody who's gonna be shipped down
every every so often

1206
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:02,320
more often than not shakedowns earth
something that ur

1207
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,360
thats donner fairly regular basis

1208
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,280
are they basically go to your locker
where you have

1209
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,290
your your personal belongings in the
open it up and they perceive

1210
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:16,880
to rifle through all your things looking
for

1211
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,250
what's known as contraband and
contraband to be most anything

1212
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,380
all yeah I

1213
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,760
I can't really give you any examples
because

1214
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,940
because it could literally be anything
at all

1215
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,980
that you're not supposed to have and the
list is Amber's

1216
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:37,080
and they can literally just make it up
as they go along like

1217
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:42,880
you one day maybe you you shouldn't be
having too many paper clips or something

1218
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,180
another day you have one too many pairs
of socks

1219
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:50,050
and that's considered contraband unit
Opel parent too many books

1220
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:53,400
what's at you got it all every many
books yeah actually

1221
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,480
comets also a terrible thing

1222
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,830
and and and a horrible transgression
against the Bureau of Prisons to have

1223
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,519
too many books to read

1224
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,580
and noms I could never leave your grasp
what the reasoning was behind

1225
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:13,440
boil down initially when I first got
there I was sent so many books

1226
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,469
from people on the outside that down

1227
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:19,900
I was told that I had too many books and
I had to get rid of

1228
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:24,200
most them worlds they were gonna be
confiscated so

1229
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,670
rather than letting the prison keep them
I ended up getting a box

1230
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:31,070
mailing home brown

1231
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,269
I could literally go on and on and on
about all

1232
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:37,700
really bizarre things that that a

1233
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:41,810
that occur in these places I I think arm

1234
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:45,580
me ask a manual think it's appropriate
now to start taking some questions

1235
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:50,490
yes people could lineup but the usual
spot where we take questions

1236
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:53,760
pushing and shoving this time just
normally

1237
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,590
I and 5 ever get fast forward to the day
that you were released what was that

1238
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,320
like

1239
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,360
house released com very very interesting

1240
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,549
arm once once you're there they'll long
the interesting thing

1241
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:09,780
is anybody who's

1242
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,070
whose whose sentence was for a couple
months you don't really get that much

1243
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,849
respect in prison

1244
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:20,030
because anybody sentence was that short

1245
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:23,240
usually is an informant of some sort or
another

1246
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,309
because otherwise why would your sense
be that short

1247
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:29,350
its usually it's highly unlikely that
somebody

1248
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,750
com is sentenced only a couple months
are

1249
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:37,010
if they were even warranted home prison
term

1250
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:42,120
the fact that I was there for a year arm

1251
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,430
greatly helped my might inter in May

1252
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,590
relationships and %ah the

1253
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,670
the other thing was some the fact that
the media

1254
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:56,750
was so intent on ongoing interview me on

1255
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:00,750
in prison all the time before long
everyone knew me

1256
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:05,860
so that really worked in my favor and
noms

1257
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,460
I wasn't really screwed around with very
often

1258
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,650
up by the the prison staff and

1259
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:15,820
not all by any the inmates in fact

1260
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:19,750
mostly majority the inmates that I knew
extremely friendly

1261
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:23,270
with me Tom

1262
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:28,070
its it strange that a when you're there
for such a long time

1263
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:32,290
are you you just kinda get accustomed to
the way things are

1264
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:35,330
and now when when

1265
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:39,540
not somebody that no that's been with
you the whole time

1266
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:44,280
I actually leaves you really glad that
he's leaving and finally going home at

1267
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,490
the same time

1268
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,630
kinda sad to see him go because you know
its

1269
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:52,040
one less person that you can play gin or
something like that

1270
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,250
and that may seem kinda funny you really

1271
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,380
you really zero in on on the simple
things

1272
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:01,740
because you lose so much in prison that
om

1273
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:05,650
its little things like a card game or

1274
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:09,090
just just you know a simple conversation
with somebody that you

1275
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:13,140
you know that that you smoke a cigarette
with things like that become really

1276
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,660
important

1277
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:18,780
and noms by the time it was it was time
for me to actually

1278
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:24,849
even and go home rather rather snuck up
on me and took me by surprise because

1279
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:29,080
again you don't really feel like it's
time to go home because

1280
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,269
after you're there for just about here

1281
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:35,430
the OMM your to get kinda used to be

1282
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,620
and you still like being

1283
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:43,210
here by Don you know that you can either

1284
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,830
come to terms with your your current
situation

1285
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:51,110
or else you can you know make believe
that you're insane or maybe you are

1286
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,030
going insane and then you know

1287
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:57,019
you can you can go to the prison doctor
and get medicaid all kinds

1288
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:00,680
crazy antidepressants which a lot of
people there actually did

1289
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:05,560
mom which I had absolutely no intention
doing because

1290
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,390
let's just say the prison medical plan
it's not one that you one actually apply

1291
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:11,510
for

1292
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:14,650
so want one thing you wanna make sure
you

1293
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:18,790
that that you don't do when you're in
prison is actually get sick

1294
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:22,100
arm bottom

1295
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,730
anyway by the time it was it was it was
my time to go.

1296
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:32,520
arm and and I should add that I actually
refused to apply for a halfway house

1297
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,230
which com a lot of people actually
respected me for as well

1298
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:41,280
I had made up my mind mad if I was gonna
apply for halfway house

1299
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,139
I was going to them needing something in
the entire time I was there

1300
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,710
I made sure that I never went to anyone
was

1301
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,360
want the prison staff needing anything
from

1302
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,580
an a

1303
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,820
when I actually walked at a prison I
wanted to be

1304
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:02,130
where I left I walked out the door and
one call

1305
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,590
I didn't want to be going from one
prison to

1306
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,610
you now to a halfway house which is
kinda like

1307
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,900
your on the outside but you still highly
restricted

1308
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,440
so I actually opted home and my own free
will

1309
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,340
to mom turf ergo the a halfway house

1310
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:23,510
which they kinda dangle in front you
like carry because

1311
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,780
com the try to while blackmail

1312
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,719
inmates into you know doing certain
things

1313
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,730
or or putting them in really sticky
situations

1314
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:37,820
getting all their hopes will tell that
they can leave early if they get a

1315
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,490
halfway house early

1316
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:44,120
arm bada I I just convince myself early
on that I was gonna be

1317
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,170
I was gonna fall into that trap and I
actually ended up staying in prison

1318
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:52,530
until home towards the end November

1319
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:57,009
just just before Thanksgiving actually
are so luckily I got out just before the

1320
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:57,719
holidays

1321
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:01,490
so I was able to have both Thanksgiving
and Christmas

1322
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:04,730
which which was great but again it was

1323
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:11,730
it was it was a really peculiar
experience going back home again

1324
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,230
I remember

1325
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:18,960
my my girlfriend at the time pick me up

1326
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,200
from prison and noms we

1327
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:26,490
we went to town and I had something to
eat and I remember

1328
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:30,620
home I remember when I toward

1329
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:34,550
in in the restaurant felt really strange
to be in a restaurant

1330
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,679
because she brought me a change a
clothes we want the hotel

1331
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,429
shower and arm

1332
01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:45,790
we it was felt really weird to have
money again because in prison obviously

1333
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:49,019
have you don't have money home

1334
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,320
and to actually sit in a restaurant and
decide what it was I wanted to eat

1335
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,330
and nevermind that but being

1336
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:59,500
out in a wide open space in just being
able to you know

1337
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:03,050
walk anywhere I damn well please which
which was really

1338
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:06,060
confusing at first and and was confusing

1339
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,010
for number weeks afterwards

1340
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:13,890
I remember I ordered a grilled chicken
sammich

1341
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,750
with french fries and a coke and noms

1342
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:21,280
on before that I think I had some kind
of soup

1343
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,599
and for whatever reason I remember it
was

1344
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,630
it was the best damn food aid every

1345
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:32,980
the funny thing about that is that %uh
prison food all taste the same

1346
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:36,250
arm number one thing that you need in
prison

1347
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,490
is beans and noms

1348
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:43,980
everybody eats beans everybody's
constantly farting all the time

1349
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:47,370
Picasa that fact and to make matters
worse

1350
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:51,519
the guys that are that week live arm and
spend a lot of time

1351
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,900
bodybuilding the down they steal eggs
from the kitchen

1352
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,830
and so they're constantly eating hard
boiled eggs and eating

1353
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:03,820
you know meals that ur constantly
involving beans and some

1354
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:07,320
way shape or form so they're even more
deadly

1355
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,809
and everybody else so long

1356
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:15,190
so I remember the that was the first
today

1357
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:18,790
home and then nom I remember for for
dinner

1358
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:22,340
I my parents had asked me you know what
it was that I wanted for

1359
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,650
for dinner back nom

1360
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:28,950
I told them on the way back I want to
get pizza

1361
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,040
from %ah favorite neighborhood pizzeria
on the way back

1362
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,210
sorta really launch

1363
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:38,320
home which we did and then nom

1364
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,259
for dinner I remember com my my parents
made lasagna

1365
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:45,290
which was amazing eat real lasagna

1366
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:50,310
when I go to prison arm in prison they
actually have lasagna

1367
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:53,420
home if if they're yes

1368
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:58,860
anyone in the audience whose what knows
what prison lasagna is me down

1369
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,940
arm you'll understand why

1370
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:05,910
why I'm laughing arm if there's anyone
dozen

1371
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:09,349
home I'll turn your stomach by telling
you

1372
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:12,700
basically its government issue

1373
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,400
lasagna noodles whatever the hell those

1374
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:20,830
and noms they're basically filled with

1375
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:24,420
home cottage cheese and

1376
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,750
com chopped turkey

1377
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:32,450
and ever and ever horseless and of
course

1378
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:36,280
topped with your favorite government
grade tomato sauce

1379
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,250
so you can imagine that it was it was a
hot time in the

1380
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,810
in the cafeteria when they serve sonya

1381
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:47,350
arm so it was it was great to work at
home in

1382
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:50,640
and and mom and dad's lasagna

1383
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,880
home that that was that was probably the

1384
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,140
the most one the most exciting things
have

1385
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,390
there was released the other strange
thing is that on

1386
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:05,469
everything and everyone looks smaller
and was really sure why that was

1387
01:32:05,469 --> 01:32:08,929
are I think that I am grown so
accustomed

1388
01:32:08,929 --> 01:32:12,120
too well living sorta

1389
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:16,510
military environment where you live in
like an open barracks

1390
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:19,810
in open cells home

1391
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:23,240
where there's some couple couple a dozen
cells

1392
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:27,670
in this wide-open Barrick's with Tom

1393
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:31,679
RR a bunk bunk beds on both sides

1394
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,490
the barracks with a long narrow walkway
going down the middle

1395
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:39,670
and you just basically used to this open
space

1396
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:42,760
and really no privacy whatsoever so

1397
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,800
mom I think whenever I felt like I was
in a room or in a confined space it

1398
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,020
actually felt small

1399
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:52,640
was which was kinda confusing for a
while

1400
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,730
by Tom so anyway that's

1401
01:32:56,730 --> 01:33:01,590
that was how things were to the park to
the point that I get released

1402
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:06,740
I i admit that I'm I'm a recovering
ex-con

1403
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:10,690
I think doing a fairly good job of it
certainly in you know

1404
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:13,820
in a lot better shape mentally now them
them

1405
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:17,299
then I probably was I was first release

1406
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:22,410
released even when I when I first went
to prison

1407
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:26,480
let's take some questions alright by
this point out that those

1408
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:31,969
giving questions you have to address a
question see the fiber or Bernie s

1409
01:33:31,969 --> 01:33:36,240
because any risk communicate with each
other

1410
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:40,230
ask a question twice if you have to yes
asked

1411
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:43,830
independently Frank this Spurs okay

1412
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:46,860
right my first question will be a little
like that I

1413
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:50,320
bernie I noticed that

1414
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,860
you said that you want reg rights

1415
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:57,179
a initially for actually for a number of
days I I think

1416
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:00,210
and also a

1417
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:04,090
what was it yet you also and ask to
speak to your lawyer and were denied

1418
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:04,650
that right

1419
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:08,730
initially which to ignore and I also

1420
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:13,230
I heard that similar stuff happens to

1421
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:16,390
another hacker to mention

1422
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:19,730
that he he was asking to

1423
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:23,890
asked her that when his house is rated
there was a search warrant there was

1424
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,040
even side

1425
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,100
or search warrant arrived late on

1426
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,880
our people in a having had some legal
experience with all the stuff

1427
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,000
our people in this kind of position who
were treated this way

1428
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,090
that thats government breaking the law
as far as I understand it

1429
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:41,370
are you able to sue for punitive damages
in

1430
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:48,370
in that circumstance

1431
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:51,230
I

1432
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:54,460
3d about three years ago I would I would
have thought so

1433
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,739
I was pretty naive and assuming

1434
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:01,810
com currently these is kinda

1435
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:05,429
Lee violations saw a writer

1436
01:35:05,429 --> 01:35:09,929
are change on course message is
particularly so when

1437
01:35:09,929 --> 01:35:13,630
one there a local

1438
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:17,500
local law enforcement agents as opposed
to federal

1439
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,800
I defense team recently professional

1440
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,210
very good liars very professional liars
respect up

1441
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:28,989
my my original arrest

1442
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:33,739
was by a consortium local and federal
law enforcement officers

1443
01:35:33,739 --> 01:35:37,540
up I did say now not true that irate not

1444
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:41,540
right reg me when I was arrested when I
was arrested we're not rich

1445
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:45,019
on it was several hours later that their
reg

1446
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:49,429
up it'd right Ridge speaking earlier

1447
01:35:49,429 --> 01:35:52,710
to I was not permitted to have my
attorney

1448
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:56,810
on they were all very excited there
police station secret service was

1449
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,390
questioning

1450
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:00,780
on tactician local law enforcement
agencies questioning

1451
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:04,809
are because I wasn't going to tell them
where I live there was interested in my

1452
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:06,440
heart friends house

1453
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,739
coincidentally saw my vehicle at
clinton's

1454
01:36:09,739 --> 01:36:13,230
on few blocks least age I did sized

1455
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:16,310
up but to

1456
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:19,380
so the address they had on

1457
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,760
their records lessened the other stores
livings I just moved

1458
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:27,130
weeks before that and they demanded to
know why

1459
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:30,570
I said well I'd like to talk to my
attorneys at law you don't have that

1460
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:30,969
option

1461
01:36:30,969 --> 01:36:34,650
you have to challenge your address first
for a late archer

1462
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:38,830
reason I wanna talk to my attorneys at
one time I turn it in be there

1463
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:41,900
present my home while the search for
taking place

1464
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:45,140
because knew that there's going to be
some funny stuff going on in

1465
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,980
he should be there well bottom line is a
a

1466
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:52,080
on night spent scurrying around

1467
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,290
on the figured out why right get actual

1468
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:58,610
live strange thing the day before his
arrest

1469
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:02,259
my pager went off at my home phone
number which is very strange because it

1470
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:06,160
with and never did figure out what was
it that the

1471
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,460
they confiscated my pager the numbers
did a reverse lookup

1472
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,530
and found the one at the numbers agers

1473
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:15,540
was to check that all the addresses

1474
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:19,380
all the numbers on my pager and ended up
its fun place

1475
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:24,550
by a a roommate at the place where I was
looking at that time

1476
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:27,630
let the man because he was scared to
death researchers appear

1477
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:31,060
to work and they proceeded without a
search warrant at my home

1478
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:34,730
to search the entire house not just a

1479
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:37,989
just areas were my room a key creations

1480
01:37:37,989 --> 01:37:43,900
researchers federal case law on this in
an apartment situation

1481
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:47,010
a roommate is not authorized to get
permission to

1482
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:50,090
on portion of this research another
person's better

1483
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:53,449
sort of thing well they just ransack the
whole place on

1484
01:37:53,449 --> 01:37:57,219
next morning they came back with an
official search warrant listing all the

1485
01:37:57,219 --> 01:37:57,640
items

1486
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:01,929
the already listed the night before on
the things that were there this was

1487
01:38:01,929 --> 01:38:05,810
basically rubber-stamped by a local
judge in

1488
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:09,770
villanova pennsylvania living and

1489
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:14,010
later least the night ever having been
there twice

1490
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:17,300
my roommate after all this show was over

1491
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,670
%ah hold me that there there the night
before the threat him

1492
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:24,360
it for him in jail because it an extra
he had a non

1493
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,570
place in Skopje x-wing fighter on his
home computer

1494
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,980
and he said that he didn't cooperate
they were gonna arrest him for having

1495
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:36,760
Pirates of a risk so they do these
tricks I think he's a pretty routine but

1496
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,370
now the courts are extremely biased

1497
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:43,860
towards the law enforcement community

1498
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:47,400
and just your word against theirs

1499
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:50,900
down so now it's not realistic

1500
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,989
try to see them for these things okay I
guess the picture is

1501
01:38:54,989 --> 01:39:00,420
your case they were just really very the
term determine this for you

1502
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:04,040
I don't think it's to screw which is
they wanted on

1503
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:08,840
they just wanna do a bang-up job I guess
and in this case the secret service was

1504
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,610
heavily pushing the prosecution because

1505
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:13,759
apparently a personal issue

1506
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:17,650
when I was rest by the secret service
after the state charges dropped

1507
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:20,719
they told me they take another one of
the two Asians picking up

1508
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:24,800
the county presented federal was one of
the two Asians pictured India

1509
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,080
in the photographs picking picking their
noses which ended up on television

1510
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:33,190
he told me to the late Heath you may be
aware no uncertain terms that this was a

1511
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:36,380
this was this

1512
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:39,890
this visit getting even he didn't say
that it was clear to me that that was

1513
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:40,230
his

1514
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:43,980
tone of voice so how did you initially

1515
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:47,230
how what you were charged for ultimately

1516
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:50,250
how did that come to their attention

1517
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,670
they couldn't to see these pictures on
TV at the side

1518
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:57,190
definitely not gonna go arrest this guy
how did how did the

1519
01:39:57,190 --> 01:40:01,530
come to their attention that you had a
modified tone dialer and software

1520
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:05,300
that's a that's a very good question it
it's there's a lot of this turns in all

1521
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:05,840
this

1522
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,350
they were not aware that I had anything
to do with these photographs being on

1523
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:10,070
television

1524
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:13,610
until my home a search in the founders
photographs the region a secret service

1525
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,489
was involved

1526
01:40:14,489 --> 01:40:19,010
first place in the case because the
local police confiscated from me

1527
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:22,300
a box of crystals on modified

1528
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,750
that was in my possession house a a
couple guys who called me and said well

1529
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,719
I wanna buy some these crucial secret

1530
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,650
a great example to I was so intense
personal mailer for five dollars

1531
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:36,040
and is that how you came to the
attention local law enforcement not

1532
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,710
because I was going on and

1533
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:41,429
this Chapman selling for years but a
couple guys called me and said a

1534
01:40:41,429 --> 01:40:44,810
me decide eleven-hour by by police
forces from

1535
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:48,090
so I was going over across the street at
7-Eleven is a post office heading over

1536
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,030
to get my mailing

1537
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:52,679
so whatever their and I was awesome
crystals there

1538
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:55,800
and the some neighbor called in
apparently starting

1539
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,890
think was a drug deal going down or
police officer sought

1540
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,820
and that the the affidavit said today
was a suspected drug deal going down

1541
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:05,860
so police 13 police officer showed up at
the scene

1542
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:10,410
and detained this offer two hours well
Acer like to search their vehicles

1543
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:14,050
against my consent my dad there's no
probable cause to search it

1544
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:18,230
they deny that later too well in the box
was seized without my consent

1545
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:23,150
they did not know it was in the box the
top which was in violation

1546
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:26,780
a flaw but to later on even other police
report said

1547
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,880
box was confiscated they testified under
oath that

1548
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:33,410
that was given to the consent but the
judge to one along with them it's it's

1549
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:35,580
it's amazing this that happens in the
getaway

1550
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,850
but they do routinely as try to get to
the

1551
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:43,280
by the questions that are rapidly
running out of time no problem

1552
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:50,280
said Captain Crunch yeah

1553
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:56,489
question directed towards a lark
fiber-optic

1554
01:41:56,489 --> 01:42:00,120
has anybody contacted you well you've
been in jail

1555
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,559
to house cue for

1556
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:06,850
technical information

1557
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:10,739
while you're there actually now we

1558
01:42:10,739 --> 01:42:14,640
nobody really ever approached me do
anything

1559
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,960
for them the people people in general
didn't really understand what it is

1560
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:26,140
that idea day they understood that I did
something along the lines

1561
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:30,250
a break in the computers kinda like and
word games or something like that

1562
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,510
yes like without analogy to refer to

1563
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:37,989
the didn't really know what it was
elated

1564
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:41,660
and if they did have half an idea of
what I did

1565
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:45,090
the weren't really sure you know how
that would

1566
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:49,239
help them out anyway I mean in general

1567
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:52,580
no people didn't really ask reid to

1568
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:57,969
do anything like me phone calls writing
like

1569
01:42:57,969 --> 01:43:01,520
yeah cuz when I was in in prison on

1570
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,340
I was approach by and over individuals

1571
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:09,650
were very knowledgeable in phone
technology

1572
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,780
and I thought maybe you my dry across
does

1573
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:16,099
same people as well thank you

1574
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:19,699
on is the last question go ahead

1575
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:24,360
I fiber at I like to find out some
information on the

1576
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,060
conditions if your release and what
kinda restrictions you're still under

1577
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:33,199
on not under any I restrictions that

1578
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:37,530
are outside the scope I'll ordinary
supervised release

1579
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:42,250
there's a nothing in my supervised
release that has anything to do with

1580
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,580
computer or technological restrictions

1581
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:48,809
I am I can associate with any known

1582
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:52,170
felons which is a regular restriction

1583
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:55,530
arm i cant travel without permission

1584
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:59,250
at the state which is a typical
restriction

1585
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,350
I don't have any kind of

1586
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:05,360
weird restrictions like

1587
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,810
like some the things they've been trying
to pull on people

1588
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,480
recently like not being able to use the
internet or anything like that

1589
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:16,600
ours not nothing like that

1590
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,400
okay I wanna thank God for the view for
being here today

1591
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,469
Emanuel a I want to say one click thing
before I actually wrap this up

1592
01:44:24,469 --> 01:44:27,840
on alright I yes go ahead and

1593
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,620
in March caisson fortunately didn't
happen why should it happen in my case

1594
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,849
and in March case

1595
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:38,060
on a la Turk the reason a lot of people
go to federal prison

1596
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,690
and other capers aside from what they're
charged with doing

1597
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:45,000
I the the prosecution's case is

1598
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,360
are often made much easier because a

1599
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:52,150
informants for people who come forward
with information about

1600
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:56,389
the defendant I know that happened Mr
case and it happened in mind as well

1601
01:44:56,389 --> 01:45:00,460
I gonna give you some quick statistics
at in a federal prisons

1602
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,420
you US federal judicial system

1603
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:07,989
97 percent

1604
01:45:07,989 --> 01:45:12,190
up the cases that are Rockport
ninety-seven percent of indictments

1605
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:16,179
result in convictions at a phenomenal
success rate

1606
01:45:16,179 --> 01:45:19,510
ninety-five percent of those cases never

1607
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:24,199
make it to trial and I should tell you a
couple things

1608
01:45:24,199 --> 01:45:28,350
and that is that I am whole lotta

1609
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:31,820
prosecutions are being meted out without
trials and

1610
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:36,920
the reason for that is that the the
federal sentences

1611
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,480
are potentially so long that people

1612
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:45,270
get really scared that they're gonna
spend you know years and years in prison

1613
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:50,510
and will generally rat out anybody there
involved in any kind of activity that

1614
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,010
the government feels

1615
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:57,270
is a illegal and will get off with
minimal or no sense at all

1616
01:45:57,270 --> 01:46:01,639
on I just want to tell people that to

1617
01:46:01,639 --> 01:46:05,030
now a lot of people are going to jail
unnecessarily

1618
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:08,809
as a result love %ah people not

1619
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:12,600
just learning to say talk to my lawyer

1620
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:17,110
on it's really unfortunate that we
wouldn't have this kinda conviction rate

1621
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:21,530
on hackers or other people for that
matter maybe we should be in prison but

1622
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,559
in any case

1623
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,280
and he's gonna crimes where there's like
no when there are no victims involved

1624
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:31,330
no one is hurt on the hacking community
really needs to learn this that

1625
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:35,590
everyone all the best service community
by simply not ratting out

1626
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:42,590
there there a fellow hackers

1627
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:46,330
over the past few years over the past
few years it has gotten a lot worse

1628
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:50,880
on people are seen to be stumbling over
each other to read each other out

1629
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,380
and we're all losers India as a result
of this and

1630
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:58,570
will now maybe one person will ball
serve less time but it's extremely

1631
01:46:58,570 --> 01:46:59,679
self-serving

1632
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:03,350
and a you know you have to hang together
in all this

1633
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:06,360
on I just want to make that statement
because it

1634
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:10,780
it's a disturbing trend and people need
to learn

1635
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:16,429
us K I just wanna say the two have your
probably

1636
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:20,780
to the most inspirational people in my
life I'm proud that we both as friends

1637
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:21,759
and

1638
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,080
I'm really glad that both the viewer out
today

1639

with us the

1640

and coming up next we having

1642
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:42,850
panel followed by the grand finale

Tian Hao on your way
