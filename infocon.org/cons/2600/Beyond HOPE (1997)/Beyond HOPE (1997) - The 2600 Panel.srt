00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,169
hello everyone

3
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,909
I can see you because million lie to my
face I think there's people out there

4
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,400
an occasional wiseguy the laser this is
the 2600

5
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,400
this is web page

6
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,120
somebody better explain the new issue

7
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,940
2600 as I'll and some reason people are
confusing it with another magazine

8
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,830
I don't know why and this one is out

9
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,039
it's free so if you're kind of cautious
never heard of this before you don't

10
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,120
want to buy something just

11

we're all populated with the magazine in
some way or another

14
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,740
so I'm going to let people introduced
themselves

15
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,539
and say just who they are all on a
manual and on the other

16
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,780
where the cofounders will start

17
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,780
over there on the left all-round this

18
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:59,889

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,870
GSM

85
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,200
tomorrow night 11 interesting things
really stand

86
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,540
his how's about 2600 our history where
we're going what we've done any

87
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,660
questions people might have

88
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,180
we started back in nineteen eighty-four
me and Dave

89
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,600
pretty much went into an office were
supposed to be in late at night and

90
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,300
Xerox

91
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,970
issues center about two dozen people
we're going to be arrested the next day

92
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,830
and before we knew it more and more
people wanted to read

93
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,220
and it wasn't until nineteen EV a don't
believe that we actually

94
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,650
our first issue in the news are now

95
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,100
are our subscriber base has started
around

96
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,310
2000 2500 it's been that way about 10
years

97
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,640
or newsstand distribution has shot up to
about 40,000

98
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,080
which

99
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,660
thats a testament to apparently people
are

100
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,640
they don't wanna be on any list
specialist from my house which is fine

101
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,420
to me it's a lot easier to send the
things out

102
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,890
distributor said about each individual
person

103
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,410
we've seen a lot of changes we started
out I said I just

104
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,870
half paper now we're glossy magazine

105
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,959
looks a lot like water but that doesn't
quite

106
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,430
read the same we've

107
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,770
we've seen a lot of weirdness come and
go with milosevic think people with

108
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,050
expanded

109
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,560
here we are now I mean basically the
hacker community has

110
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,700
has pretty much worse over the past 13
years

111
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,330
as enable us to grow into invest money
that things like this

112
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,950
for people to get introduced to things
we've got a radio show in New York City

113
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,660
once a week

114
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,079
which you can now get on real radio
CD-rom's outside

115
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,579
week pretty much you all the musicians
ever done fibers on that as well

116
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,970
and jobs it just keeps getting more and
more interesting as the years go on

117
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,329
we keep expanding into new places I
think with 22 magazine is done

118
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,400
is shown us the power that we can

119
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,839
have ourselves we complain about the
media so what we did was

120
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,130
effect become the media we we publisher
or magazine

121
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,280
we have a radio show we can argue for
now

122
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,459
one way or the other because we know
it's not going to get out to the

123
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,600
Associated Press and The New York Times
or

124
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,350
or NBC or any and I think a lot of
people are realizing with the

125
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,500
information age

126
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,180
we're the ones charger technology with
the ones I can't do things

127
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,940
with the technology we have some
ingenuity so I think my 600 as

128
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,990
done that for a bunch of people will be
around

129
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,990
or 2600

130
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,980
really cool

131
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,559
those red back issues

132
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,709
things you get this him

133
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:08,489
I had the promise

134
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,889
working day that I wouldn't come up here
and lie or

135
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,949
say anything embarrassing about them or
the past

136
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:21,949
magazine so I wanna errors

137
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,540
2600 been a very important part of my
life since I was about 15

138
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,770
years old I'll

139
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,839
written articles taking photographs

140
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,959
my first job was answering the phone
Aaron

141
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,209
and typing to subscribe wanted

142
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,290
taking them off week later when their
checks bounce

143
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,580
and I kinda shake

144
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,950
have a job as much press now fortunate
position

145
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,950
by

146
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,099
he answers business

147
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,130
nobody answers estranged

148
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,510
specialists conference announce when we
start answering the phones

149
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,179
than people call back over and over
again want to know everything there is

150
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:20,770
to know

151
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,040
what happens if i dial this number it
just gets outta hand

152
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,309
we have ok automated thing do the stuff
that needs to be done in the office

153
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,360
so it's nothing personal just have time
and if you pick up some other

154
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,160
really old back issues a manual wrote
some pretty scathing articles about

155
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,380
companies that actually

156
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,030
have automated devices pick up the
phones

157
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,240
and that's another interesting part are
evolution

158
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,510
I just wanna with their

159
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,760
used answered personal

160
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,190
and fact that we didn't have a phone

161
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,510
first first few months we have no the
best days

162
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,470
had a lot of trouble reaching them back
we had

163
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:16,050
someone else's

164
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:23,050
side first human someone give out your
cellular phone number as the press

165
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,810
contact

166
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,070
pam is getting all the phone calls all
day long various media people around the

167
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:37,070
world

168
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,590
even though you and I and personally
manual like

169
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,199
the voice BBS other

170
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,470
are you text resources provide readers

171
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,679
what about the boys BBS I can't stand
the boys BBS

172
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,900
drives me crazy we we we've had these
boys BBS is now for a few years

173
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,950
we had 1 there was a single line BBS

174
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,679
just drive us crazy we had to rewrite of
the software

175
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,020
to run batch files so every time you
left a message it basically will

176
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,929
with erase sixty greetings rename

177
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,419
sixty previous greetings to 60 more and
that's what happen every time you

178
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,419
you posted a message was a hacker
various

179
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,200
berries means we have a new system now
that holds four lines but it's not much

180
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,270
better as far as touched a recognition

181
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,399
or spear anything like that so

182
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,850
it's rather frustrating people seem to
like it people out there that

183
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,460
use the voice PBS and talk to the people
through it

184
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,980
so will continue doing is just it's it's
a challenge that way

185
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,950
all your number is 516 473 2626

186
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,029
of Brittany recordings on their

187
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,649
might have some fun does base but
another way people

188
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,309
if people don't have access to the
internet for instance the way for them

189
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:06,830
to keep

190
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,059
keep in touch with other people find out
what's going on we try to offer that as

191
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,408
much as possible we started the

192
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:15,950
2600 meeting which by the way they just
celebrated their 10th anniversary

193
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:22,480
the first 2600 meeting with

194
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,010
were actually inspired by the happy take
place every Friday

195
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,279
your new york city fact there'll be a
reunion tomorrow

196
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:37,279
all happy anyway it's interesting we
started in New York City at citicorp we

197
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,950
expanded

198
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,960
to San Francisco Washington DC

199
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,559
and then the the secret service read at
the washington DC me

200
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,960
happen after that we at a hundred new
cities because everybody wanted to

201
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,860
to challenge so I think that's very much
in the spirit

202
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,789
when something bad happens to us just
come back

203
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:04,789
even more strange for me

204
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,950
yeah this is a good seguido burning

205
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,230
little trouble with with the Secret
Service Act

206
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,400

207
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,420

publicly available not well

226
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,669
publicized and

secret service agents repeatedly me is

228
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,950
threat to community

229
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,550
because I had this information my files
and

230
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,149
as a result there pretty

231
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,380
empty claims the same information

232
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,100

its not gonna get any better scan its
gonna

237
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,720
its gonna mushroom more so I don't know
they learned a lesson from that or not

238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,670
we will find out wasn't the

239
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,200
real reason secrets mad at you had a
picture oven agent picking his nose

240

241
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,660
I would under

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,400
contents you go there

243

to the Secret Service section about four
years ago

244
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,640
up I got a call our friend

245
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,250

scroll down but these two businessmen

249
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,159

he got the license plate number and

251
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,760
check it out various resources and found
out that the vehicle was registered to

252
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,580
the federal government

253
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,199
they stop back at his office

254
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,890
a couple weeks later and he was ready
for them

255
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:38,890

this is the year secret service photo
album

257
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,750
actually just started their ego there
the two gentlemen right there

258
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,450
now this is about the eighth generation

259
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,270
copy of this so gotta forgive the

260
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,129
quality actually look a lot better looks
like that are you looking on a computer

261
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,550
monitor but this projection

262
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:06,430
store satellite I the gentleman on the
left

263
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,900
I and the German writer for a secret
service agent undercover

264
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,170
investigating someone I knew

265
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,770
actually in investigating an employee a
friend of mine

266
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,680
the investigation went nowhere but they
were captured on videotape

267
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,830
on karen was fairly easily seen in the
office

268
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,929
equipment missed it if they looked
around the meeting of a big deal about

269
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,960
it after a

270
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,960
the pictures ended up on the evening
news in Philadelphia

271
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,730
up

272
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,610
my friend print the photographs that
picture your reasonable

273
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:50,610
he has he had his index finger about
halfway up his nose and his picture

274
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,400

off they were sold

275
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,039
I got these

276
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,629
these photos bring it up my of my
friends a

277
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,900
eight-millimeter tape recorder

278
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,659
video tape recorder like that you know
that world I took the pictures /a

279
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,960
2600 meeting in Philadelphia where I
live and

280
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,730
show them around because this was a rate
on the a

281
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,210
where the breakup Washington DC meeting
at the Pentagon mall was still on

282
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,100
everybody's mind

283
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,240
and we were concerned that the same
thing might happen in philadelphia

284
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,649
so pasa figures around

285
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:43,240
on having good idea were whatever side

286
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,779
before looks good the government morning
the domain on the right is that

287
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:53,650
a special agent Thomas L Barney faster

288
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,700
up the United States Secret Service
Philadelphia office never

289
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,179
anybody

290
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:06,600
why so much in front of a federal judge
this guy was describing

291
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,799
how much of a threat Bernie s was to
society because the end dental

292
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,500
his garage no it's not what we want like
it might be in c4

293
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,659
now it wasn't buddy in my garage they
said

294
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,240
well this was admire at two different

295
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,270
court dates the secret service sobriety

296
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,510
stated to the judge in open court that

297
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,710
mister cummings said material in his
home

298
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,750
that we believe to be c4 plastic
explosives upon analysis

299
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,779
this is him paraphrasing again analysis
it turned out not to be C four but the

300
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:46,919
fact that it might have been

301
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,090
concerns us greatly that's a quote

302
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,940
that is wanna like now about a dozen

303
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,549
similar type statements he made just
really make no sense but but

304
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,230
the judge's decision to let this stuff
like by really amazing

305
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,399
so up and we're back to the Astoria

306
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,610
voters I took them to a two-timing a
Philadelphian past around

307
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,529
take them up on the wall there under
stairwell number seven

308
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,880
where we need and be a

309
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,549
Fox Television affiliate showed up at
that meeting and they were not invited

310
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,429
the previous the previous week there was
an article in City Paper

311
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,850
about the meetings are going on and I
guess they decided to cover it and cover

312
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,520
they did

313
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,320
they interviewed several people i cud
going to be on camera

314
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,870

319
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,630
attendees meeting and yes

320
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,659
what are these photos on the wall and I
said well

321
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,940
we believe these are undercover secret
service agents and

322
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,750
we're trying to keep tabs on them
because they're obviously hats on us

323
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,690
and Fox 29 News that was just great 29

324
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,720
channel in philadel- some so they a the
videotape

325
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,340
couple months later ended up on the
evening news prime-time and

326
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,730
this is actually a these pictures are
actually tape

327
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,990
of the air on a VCR and

328
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,020
that tape went through a couple
generations

329
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,940
duplicating and one of them ended up
2600 office sometime later after

330
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,049
I was imprisoned and that was a

331
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,740
cleaned up acid was a Scott you can
probably

332
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,010
stripe the technical details that went
into getting these pictures

333
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:52,440
of of the air and onto the web page he
would not OK it was a traumatic

334
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,780
experience for Scott

335
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,309
explain it to me while I was
incarcerated but up

336
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,000
up they were digitizing cleaned up in

337
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,520
and ended up being published 2600
magazine but back to

338
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,950
gonna say about I lost my train of
thought

339
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:16,950
America have ended up in with the on one
of these photos I think it's the

340
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,020
previous one

341
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,100
you'll see my finger wise as I was a
their ego

342
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,190
that when they're that's my finger now

343
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,809
wouldn't surprise me the secret service
when wenches the trouble

344
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,690
no trying to enhance that that that
finger to prove that was my fingerprint

345
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,470
butter I don't think that the quality
was good enough for the do that

346
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,990
I was a explaining to the Fox News

347
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,950
through with these photos were I was
saying at this picture the two secret

348
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,480
service agents walking into an officer

349
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,020
an associate of mine this is the two

350
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,480
agency looking around and asking
questions and third pictures secret

351
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,909
service agent picking his nose

352
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:05,210
and so that's a that's a story the
finger in the picture

353
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,110
and that ended up obviously on a web
page in

354
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,870
2600 so on bottom line is a

355
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,039
secret service doesn't like it when the
covers blonde that

356
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,620
for secrecy thing is really important to
them on

357
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,320
when they start you know acting
unreasonably in I

358
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,899
really violating people's rights insofar
as a

359
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:33,250
the freedom to assemble that sort of
thing then think turnabout is fair play

360
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,240
there the residence a

361
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,320
people being arrested 26 meetings and
other towns

362
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,250
yeah it happens all over the place not
necessarily by Secret Service

363
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,309
by security guards by

364
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:53,100
the secret service i think is what we
really have to worry about

365
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,340
insofar as what happened to bernie I
mean it wasn't about

366
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,470
red box or instructions on how to use a
red box

367
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,289
possession technology about them being
pissed off

368
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,070
but then being pissed off being
embarrassed like this

369
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,110
widely fell I believe with the secret
service once said

370
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,240
bernie of they said something to the
effect

371
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,030
this was not a exact right that there is
a

372
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,668
a quote not publicly

373
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:29,110
were not public words up the

374
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,780
the main federal prosecutor key federal
prosecutor in my case

375
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,780
had worked closely with

376
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,549
my attorney the second attorney Spurs
attorney at mikeys

377
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:45,440
pretty incompetent fired him but the
second attorney I got

378
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,840
pretty company guy is a former federal
prosecutor himself

379
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,270
and trujillo he worked

380
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,520
as a federal prosecutor for I think for
five years

381
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,649
with my prosecutor I and then

382
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:04,139
as he said saw the light and became a
defense attorney

383
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:07,360
that the money was better to with

384
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,820
driving Mercedes rebuild me

385
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,080
but anyway this prosecutor

386
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,539
and change your name she confided in my
turn

387
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,539
then pass this information on to me that

388
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,379
well the real reason it is in jail

389
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,409
is not because this electronic stuff

390
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:33,820
but because Secret Service photographs
frequencies and other information had

391
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,559
files now when she was asked about this

392
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,470
by reporter roberts dean for in an
underground

393
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,090
thinking she completely denied surprised
gonna

394
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,750
say oh yeah really that's what all this
is about on

395
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,309
the seekers this on serving approaching
on a top another panel

396
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:59,200
secret service also stated to the
individual who took these pictures

397
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,659
this is after I was incarcerated that

398
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:07,080
well nobody fucks with the secret
service without us fucking with them

399
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,690
and with two thousand agents we've got
the biggest gang in town

400
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,080
now if that's not a have a bias to

401
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,168
viewpoint I don't know what is arm and I
i have it on good authority

402
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:24,138
person told me this is not the kind of
person would would make this up

403
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,240
so we're we've got to quote

404
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,800
federal a profit across here in secret
service that

405
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,330
might explain about and

406
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,759
now they the it as much as admit in
writing

407
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,839
in my ear recent investigation report
that

408
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,879
quote there were no victims in the
offense

409
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,580
but a doesn't matter victims now there's
a new federal laws

410
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,119
basically naked a felony to possess

411
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,510
hardware or software that could be
misused

412
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,900
and it's pretty broad and are going to
that another panel

413
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,150
this weekend we have a panel Sunday
afternoon as dealing with scary

414
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,089
legislation

415
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,750
how you can be prosecuted for living
your normal daily life

416
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,660
with the Bernie s case that was probably
one of the most

417
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,770
troubling things fiber-optic was
troubling itself

418
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,970
weekend to but the birdie S case

419
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,920
really was scary just ferocity of their
attack

420
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,350
what they were willing to do completely
destroy somebody's life

421
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,450
saying the same thing again kevin
Mitnick

422
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,720
they also were didn't attack me they
attacked

423
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,180
other critics have their behavior
there's

424
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,629
actors neater

425

428
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,049
somewhat critical wasn't within

429
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:01,490
wasn't really was pretty mild criticism
my opinion

430
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,740
but the gentleman was following Thomas
morning in that one food

431

with John right there on the left back I

433
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,850
be a he's a a narcotics investigator

quartz crystals I was talking to
somebody work for narcotics

437
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,990
but a this Ronnie steered him

438
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,950
your straight on that misconception on

439
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,790
mister a mister detective Morris

time bernie & this this is this is

believe from from the government you can
by copying this

450
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,700
one other things at Tom morning was
saying

451
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,170
was reason to lock already has a preview
longer was the fact that

452
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,490
all these people are are making phone
calls

453
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,220
criticizing with the secret service is
doing somebody send mail to the first

454
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,810
lady

455
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,119
you know yeah so was I have to do with
anything

456
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,250
they no apparent because my sent mail
Hillary Clinton that means a Bernie

457
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:48,900
asses

458
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,160
threat to society maybe in their view
how the internet works et cetera

459
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,640
I was a stretcher logic it there they're
using and

460
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,879
he went on to say his his supporters
have taken it upon themselves to

461
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,390
and that's when the judge cut him off
and said that this has nothing to do

462
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,220
with the case

463
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,970
I'm gonna send him to a lot jail time
anyway

464
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,250
so you know they the it was amazing
watching this because a bunch of us went

465
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,140
down pennsylvania

466
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,368
and witness just what they did to

467
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:23,530
and it was amazing seeing how the local
bomb ginza

468
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,440
a small town he was being sent stand
reacted to a secret service agent being

469
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,250
in town

470
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,660
like you know elvis coming if I want to
be part of the secret service and they

471
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,770
would do whatever the skies

472
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,660
said is only two thousand up to its yet
here they are

473
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,580
where the means gangs didn't know radio
station

474
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,710
PBA I also receive a telephone call for
service

475
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,020
I mentioned earlier that the PBA I we're
the show off the hook

476
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,509
we had quite a lot of material on the
birdie S case

477
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:58,589
and one of the things that happens after
bernie would speak to us from prison

478
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,170
I wanna things that happened was a
secret service contact the radio station

479
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:02,940
WBAI

480
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,619
here in New York and they the

481
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,950
hide it demanded that we stop doing this
because

482
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,049
it was was of concern to them

483
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:16,750
that it might cause

484
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,200
a problem within the prison system might
make people think critically at the

485
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,230
government or something like this:

486
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,440
I guess they have heard WBAI before what
what

487
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,960
we stand for how we don't take any shit
from any party

488
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,180
but basically we refused to stop

489
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,350
airing Bernie s interviews

490
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,150
in the autumn and tapes oh the humanity
tapes and we told them you know

491
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,650
you can just listen to the station
yourself you know

492
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,780
we don't have these tapes lying around
just free you know

493
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,910
you government people have whatever you
want you want to take the show taped the

494
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,529
show

495
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,750
apparently they do not get the CD we
have we have the whole thing outside

496
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,400
you the two gentlemen you see your
attitude really worth it

497
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,819
the head man in my ear my prosecution
both of them

498
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:07,740
on literally threatened individuals who
are speaking out

499
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,770
against their behavior and I didn't seem
very professional

500
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,109
or legal to me but these 2600 has

501
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:20,109
has prided itself over the years
challenging authority

502
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,740
when somebody threatens us with the
lawsuit we print the letter

503
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,790
that usually stops it or we just
continue doing it anyway because

504
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,830
there's nothing illegal about it we
don't respond well to threats

505
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,299
this particular thing reading respond
very well to that either

506
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:39,790
and our reaction was to post on our
website actually

507
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:45,220
go back to the to the main Secret
Service page

508
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,980
okay now we this page up

509
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,190
go to more info we decided to

510
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,080
to put this up direct response

511
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,119
to what's happening to burn yes

512
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,180
all kinds a fact tax code names things
like that about

513
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,350
secret service and

514
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,700
one of the things we have here is a
complete

515
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,380
a complete listing of secret service
frequencies

516
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,660
a complete listing Secret Service
codenames

517
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,080
person called it just kinda humorous

518
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,580
now everywhere what we said we said to
them or two

519
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,759
to the world in general was

520
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,109
you're all upset at one person having
this

521
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,770
and you prosecuted him for having this
information which is completely legal

522
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,640
and as a direct result a pure paranoia
and your willingness to

523
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,009
to ruin someone's life for having this
legally available information

524
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,400
now millions of people around the world
have access to it

525
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,290
and it was a demonstration of the power
of the web but was also kinda scary

526
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,130
because we didn't know what they would
do next

527
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,060
here's the funny thing when contacted
about this by the press

528
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,130
the Secret Service said there's nothing
wrong with that is perfectly legal

529
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,630
information

530
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,770
it was like directly opposite age bernie

531
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,970
said in court so at a the

532
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:17,619
talking about such as a mouse and say
whatever's convenient that time

533
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,650
this information changes from time to
time a lot of these she is old like

534
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,900
expired Residence Inn that sort of thing

535
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,609
if you if your studies code-named see
some common common things like everyone

536
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:32,619
in a particular first family

537
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:35,930
the code name begins with the same
letter

538
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,118
that sort of thing but this information

539
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,099
a lot of information i had as far as the
code names came from a 1981

540
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,520
magazine article monitoring times
magazine

541
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,960
good magazine about her monitoring radar
frequencies

542
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,500
and while they didn't say it wasn't from
a magazine article

543
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,430
he said information that concern them
greatly

544
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,730
without now bothering to mention that
was in a 15-year-old magazine article

545
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,690
but I am you know they their Matt with I
would have to say and

546
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,150
I think fighter probably a

547
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,470
attest to that there a federal
government is really

548
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,410
comes prosecuting criminal cases up

549
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,160
FBI Secret Service prosecutor really
masters it

550
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,140
twitching information around to making
it sound much more serious than it is

551
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,500
and because it's a secret service saying
it

552
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,950
or the FBI or federal prosecutor

553
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,119
on a lot of people believe it give it a
lot away

554
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,670
on so you know we're doing our best to
debunk

555
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,960
de Ponca decide activity

556
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,520
and we're were still updating its
information if anybody has a

557
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,190
other photographs a secret service
agents or code names or

558
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,589
actual names of agents or any other
tidbits of information about secret

559
00:43:58,589 --> 00:43:59,560
service or

560
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,470
other agencies that have been harassing
hacking community

561
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,960
we send it in lit up in with me

562
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,880
now Hamas has been very active in this
whole thing

563
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,840
when it started getting bigger and
bigger it went beyond the magazine we

564
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,370
started

565
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,509
involving people over the radio waves
people from the media

566
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,390
and before you knew what we had is
hoping protest movement going

567
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,129
to get various jail now I was but with
more time on this business about the

568
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,040
magazine we have to move on to other
things but

569
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,200
briefly am you tell us how that happened

570
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,890
you got involved in it weirdo

571
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,080
really

572
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,710
it's amazing the power I know you

573
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,040
was really response from people

574
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,509

we just had everybody here actually

580
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,890
just really came out helped power

581
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,520
something like twenty six hundred use it
as an organization to get

582
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,570
help it was really my

583
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,900
my question sparked something

584
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,270
ask people if they want to miss

585
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,780
sure work with nets are there about 2600

586
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,500
think she wants

587
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,610
questions from the floor oh yeah ok if
anyone has questions

588
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,960
where they're brilliant light is shining

589
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,380
that's where the mic waving his arms
smoke over there and ask ask a question

590
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,920
while people are

591
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,960
stumbling over themselves to get there
fiber also went to prison a couple years

592
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,810
ago I want to forget about what happened
to him because there was also another

593
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,640
living hell

594
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,049
and a complete waste of time hitting
other as much physical torture as

595
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,450
as bernie fight about a mental anguish

596
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:32,450
was briefly what happened just just
showing Secret Service thanks for coming

597
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:40,460
that's our sound

598
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,580
Louis cover

599
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:49,580
I guess

600
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,380
would you consider electronic brake
computer trespass

601
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:03,380
the

602
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,850
Senate

603
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:12,990
the crash

604
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:19,990
secret service Microsoft two carriers

605
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,440
anyway

606
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,180
my case there with electronic brake

607
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,009
computer trespass well things that were
similar

608
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:36,980
its case were after what's that

609
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,410
the used my my circumstance to make an
example

610
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,549
to set an example to send a message

611
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:46,609
which was computer trespassing wrong

612
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:51,230
should be done here's what's gonna
happen to you

613
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,579
well ironic I

614
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,049
I make a living right now doing computer
trespassing

615
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:04,079
only I have permission from the people
doing

616
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,220
for so I'm kinda confused as to

617
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,220
what the secret service and the FBI and
the church's

618
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,640
message if the message was

619
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,788
you get caught you can make a living
doing

620
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:25,789
I guess I guess they were right

621
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:28,770
was

622
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,540
reserve really harrowing experience one

623
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:38,420
I'm on probation

624
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,280
now it seems kinda ridiculous to me

625
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,410
have to pay for things that are
considered crimes

626
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,029
that happened when I was fifteen or
sixteen years old

627
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,990
I'm 25 years old its really doesn't make
any sense

628
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:59,410
really really sends we hear what

629
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,740
cases where people it's something say
three four years ago

630
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,410
have gone on to legally their respective
allies get nice job things like that and

631
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,779
also the secret service some other
organization

632
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,900
comes down on him what they did several
years earlier when they were kids

633
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,350
and their eyes become living now lose
their jobs in

634
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,880
its just pointless and senseless okay I

635
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,470
six questions

636
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,500
at its expertise it's pretty clear to a
lot of people in here

637
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,730
people read the magazine years that

638
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,620
who supports things that we individually
support

639
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,859
some causes bernie fiber

640
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,600
is there a a single

641
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,590
concept or mission statement for the
magazine for the work

642
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:57,470
2600 but you'll I mean yardstick to
measure stuff against

643
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,350
so to to figure out whether you need
your

644
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:05,000
this thing there's things that we don't
do

645
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,220
his lines we don't cross we won't print
specific

646
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:13,750
passwords to specific sisters or do
things like involved with credit card

647
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,580
crap like that you know we're into the

648
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,740
the spread of information if something

649
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,170
something works in a certain way then

650
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:28,180
we'll explain exactly how that works
rather who

651
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,710
is inconvenienced by the expiration now
we don't consider ourselves to be

652
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,950
left this right is libertarian whatever
people restoring

653
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,650
you represent this particular political
philosophy and you know hackers come

654
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,000
from all different political

655
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,550
fence we're not gonna stand there and
say this is where we're coming from this

656
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,930
is what we believe in

657
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,339
basically what we believe in is
spreading information

658
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:55,780
explaining how things were I'm not doing
religious thing time to say it's act

659
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:00,060
fast up

660
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,450
right hi

661
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:08,600
I recently listed I recently moved

662
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,080
five blocks one neighborhood and

663
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,720
nynex charge me fifty-five dollars to
reconnect my phone

664
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,770
even though I have the same phone number
in both from both locations

665
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,860
I'm just wondering if there's any way to
fight this because

666
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,850
what did they really charge me to do to
flip a switch electronically on a

667
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,540
computer

668
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,650
fifty-five dollars expenses they do this
a lot

669
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,950
it's quite a lot and it's not even a new
telephone number and Domino

670
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,000
customer you would think they would
wanna keep an old customer also

671
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,940
Time Warner Cable charge me forty
dollars to connect the cable

672
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,920
to my VCR even though they said that
what they would have to do is

673
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,050
run-up appall you know turn a switch or
something

674
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:55,490
the guy who came over and did the wiring
said he didn't have to switch it things

675
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,160
how can one fight these ridiculous
charges

676
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,810
well you if I don't buy complaining
about them to things like Public Service

677
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:03,520
Commission

678
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,070
writing letters calling calling radio
call-in shows

679
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,720
just telling more people about it

680
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,700
that's how the touch something I wiped
out because people complain about it is

681
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,610
still have crap like

682
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:20,430
goal you get a a special number you have
to pay a monthly maintenance fee every

683
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,530
month to keep the number

684
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,610
mean this what is no maintenance why do
you pay to keep your number

685
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:31,100
outta what the hell's up with that the
Fokker you get away with it because they

686
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,670
can and people start complaining about
it

687
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,790
then I'll stop but people have to start
complaining

688
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:42,710
you know we found that to be true when
caller ID was introduced in this state

689
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,710
a lot of us are very upset that

690
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:49,890
that blocking which which blocking exist
in this state

691
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,680
exist in every state because New York is
very concerned about privacy

692
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,000
it was allow state have all call
blocking

693
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,200
but we are concerned that star 67 was
the cold about to

694
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,240
block and unblock was like a toggle
switch well

695
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,900
what if you're at someone's house you
don't know what they have it set to how

696
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,570
do you know if you're blocking a road
block

697
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,810
what if you forget what if you don't
know which one you have

698
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,049
so after a while they introduced or 82

699
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,620
to to unblock star 67

700
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,650
story to it's confusing as hell

701
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:27,930
and other things like that nynex has
responded we complain about the stupid

702
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:28,290
yellow

703
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,430
the city that didn't do anything they
cover them finally

704
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,270
we complain about people being able to
star 69 private numbers

705
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,790
well we can star 69 private numbers
anymore so

706
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:44,120
if your vocal enough people support what
you're saying things can change

707
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:51,120
question just walking by the microphone
yet just

708
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,000
free comment little while back I was on
the phone

709
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,470
busy

710
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,950
sick requests as to whether

711
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:08,410
back that broke

712
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:15,410
just as one

713
00:54:17,939 --> 00:54:20,178
uses system

714
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:23,239
usurping

715
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:28,650
electoral property rights public for
psych

716
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,509
because we came here what values week

717
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:36,689
he was you're talking about a when you
dial a number you getting a busy signal

718
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:37,449
it says

719
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:44,449
you to hit 3 returned I don't think
anyone else has ever heard

720
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,140
there's a terrific section in the middle

721
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,979
magazine starts on page thirty to the
letter section you're welcome to writing

722
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:53,529
letters

723
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:56,549
you'd like to to our editor

724
00:54:56,549 --> 00:55:01,009
and they'll probably be unanswered but
up

725
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,199
this panels about the magazine itself

726
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,309
and non-specific questions he have a
phone question say the prop up tomorrow

727
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:11,819
radio broadcast here to take questions
like that they're

728
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:18,729
is really about the magazine and the
issues surrounding here at all

729
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:23,759
PPI

730
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:29,499
I was wondering if you had any comment
about the recent demise a

731
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:33,049
internet underground very sad about it

732
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:37,199
was a good magazine that's really all I
can say

733
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,989
Robert Stephens here was a writer for it
now on the ground it's work for the

734
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:43,039
birdie S case

735
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,880
covering said the infamous faxing bernie

736
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,169
unwittingly help beyond the media

737
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:55,609
which is tomorrow evening so I can talk
more about it in an underground

738
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:59,348
white fail by its

739
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:03,559
it's always sad to see a publication
down we'd like to see a lot more

740
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,179
publication remember saying this

741
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:08,319
1994 we'd like to see more aggregations

742
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,199
and as a new Touch magazine but then
again

743
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:15,239
the old Dutch magazine stop printing
really

744
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,599
haven't gotten anywhere I think there's
enough out there

745
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:25,599
different just online

746
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,819
have one whether the wiretapping apps

747
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:34,799
the wire fraud laws could be used
against federal agents

748
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,900
blessed us before

749
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,049
character charges against

750
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:49,049
actors he said

751
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:56,770
here I have remarkable hearing we're
we're hearing

752
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,790
what I think you said

753
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,590
can we can we use these wire fraud

754
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:07,130
statutes turn the tables

755
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:11,750
use them against the bed unfortunately
not

756
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:17,100
probably five or notice this also if you
read over the title 18 which is the

757
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,800
the body federal criminal statutes
there's a curious little exception at

758
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,580
the end of each

759
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,730
statute this is a

760
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:32,250
the the this this law shall not apply to
any local state or federal law

761
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,430
enforcement officer

762
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,910
so bottom line is a pretty much exam

763
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:42,870
stuff

764
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,750
a I just want to make comment actually
about the magazine

765
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:53,600
and you were talking about how you don't
publish specific passwords to specific

766
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,420
systems

767
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,890
so on and so forth by in years past

768
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:02,310
and when I'm thinking about in reference
making this question is an issue back in

769
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,570
1991

770
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:07,490
where you published a list out tiles to
the Internet

771
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,580
back then arm and

772
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:14,950
you publish the specific systems that
they were pardo

773
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,610
published obviously all phone number and
everything else

774
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,810
I noticed that over the years

775
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,490
that kind of specific information seems
to be

776
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:29,220
found less unless you have general
overviews if there's

777
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:35,010
whole system a way to break into
something you

778
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:38,550
going to that but like you said you know
usually

779
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,870
polish specific information but I
noticed that in the past

780
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:46,569
Houston when I was wondering whether or
not as you became a larger publication

781
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,730
he felt that you are more open to attack
legally

782
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,980
or criminally I mean civilly or
criminally from

783
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,250
these organizations and that's why he
stopped there's a couple reasons that we

784
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:57,790
stopped

785
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:02,790
in 1991 when we publish that circulation
magazines

786
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,610
around 7,000 down from forty thousand we
published a and the day that the

787
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,520
subscribers get their issue in the mail

788
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,900
no longer works we don't publish a
relevant information and it

789
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,950
the day that somebody gets start abusing
it is the day

790
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,070
it stops working well actually just as

791
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,330
side the summer those numbers work

792
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:27,180
working into 1993 was four years ago

793
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,530
we don't we don't have a problem

794
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,370
rethink things like that it's not it's
not accessing system so much is getting

795
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:40,460
way to make a local call it's meant for
people to use just not meant for so many

796
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,530
people to use

797
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:46,490
so I personally I don't deserve that
same thing as

798
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:50,770
as breaking into a particular system to
me that seems to be away

799
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:54,450
to access the network alternative manner

800
00:59:54,450 --> 01:00:00,130
allergy here about ten to fifteen years
ago we suppose

801
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,620
calling cards and passwords on PBS we
don't do that more

802
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:09,319
across there's a lot more people who can
find and did post

803
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,650
a lot quicker so why post because

804
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:17,010
when we first call PBS's there may be a
couple other

805
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,360
dozen people entire North East call

806
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,330
PBS the only reason we call them was to
get in touch with those people

807
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,190
so at that time 2600 these things

808
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,330
it was because it was a lot harder
people axis information general

809
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:37,040
today it's a lot easier call from
viewers downstream and he might be able

810
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,090
to give you a password

811
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,410
some you don't really need a magazine
tell you what a password is

812
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:47,040
I'll brings point

813
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,500
I'm which is the kind of 2600

814
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,950
both manual and

815
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,920
here we're talking about sneaking into a
print shop

816
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,740
you know twelve-page magazine

817
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,860
once a month without dozen or so their
friends

818
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,360
to there this conference you know

819
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,620
hundreds of people coming from all over
the country Mac news stories

820
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,430
radio shows and i think thats that part
of this

821
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,450
2600 is something that

822
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:24,440
I'd like to hear more about I wish you
know I go play

823
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,140
when I'm talking in front of two or
three hundred my closest friends

824
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,500
I and i cant think kinda stories in

825
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,270
things curious you know whether people
have questions whether there are other

826
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,280
people out there

827
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,050
have their own ideas about starting a
magazine

828
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,190
working on a project that in you know
action

829
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,510
type so many people there's most of the
people in here

830
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:52,640
what you have access to this information
wasn't are

831
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,759
work and a lot to gridlock on the park's

832
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,670
people responsible magazine start

833
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:04,090
1984 thats going on

834
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,060
fourteen years you know an amazing

835
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,070
thing in itself I wouldn't mind

836
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:15,060
you know

837
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,140
tell people something about like

838
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,460
and

839
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:29,460
kinda the real 2600 some well

840
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,420
now it's a lot easier Manx

841
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:38,550
laser printers bodies

842
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,010
not even use a magazine I think website

843
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,300
and you see me now

844
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,050
sir in all this stuff really available

845
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:55,230
but mention the fact that you have jobs
money

846
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:01,200
it's true I actually paid to get in here

847
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,820
said it's Nick in the back door

848
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,120

849
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,930
okay

850
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,500
everyone 25 but

851
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,110
back then we really have enough money to
pay for the copy machine

852
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:24,860
that we sneak in use

853
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:31,020
on eventually 2600 sort of -ism monthly

854
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,210
actually believe it or not you in a pain
in the ass

855
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,880
every month just never stop

856
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,200
arm we started off by

857
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,780
by printing she files you know

858
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,830
what they are but they're basically

859
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:56,290
things we didn't have to write somebody
else we have those issues

860
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,700
here offer sale re: come by and look at
them they're merchandiser

861
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,710
back table every issue since 1984

862
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:08,770
started you can see the evolution right
